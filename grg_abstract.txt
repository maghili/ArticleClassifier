A simple unified closed form derivation of the non-linearities of the Einstein, Yang-Mills and spinless (e.g. chiral) meson systems is given. For the first two, the non-linearities are required by locality and consistency; in all cases, they are determined by the conserved currents associated with the initial (linear) gauge invariance of the first kind. Use of first-order formalism leads uniformly to a simple cubic self-interaction.
In an ingenious way rotation (but no angular momentum) has been introduced in the case of spherical symmetry by Einstein, who has considered a stationary cluster of particles moving freely under the influence of the gravitational field produced by all of them together. The aim of the present work is to extend his idea to the non-static case, and it seems that under some circumstances instead of an indefinite gravitational collapse there is a minimum of the volume and a bouncing back.
The Friedmann and Kantowski-Sachs models of the universe are embedded in eight-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces in such a way, that their boundaries have the same structure as Geroch's<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>-boundary.





For perturbed Friedmann models of vanishing and positive curvature the time development of shear is computed by means of a linear perturbation theory. As for the smallness of the perturbation functions mathematically exact and physically meaningful conditions are stated. The shear is computed for different stages of the universe.
According to the programme of Einstein as discussed with Abraham, gravitation can be described by the bending of the systems of inertia in special relativity. This bending means non-Lorentzian transformations of the systems of reference, depending on the point in space-time. Einstein's equations for the metric imply equations for the transformation matrix, which are also of the same structure.</p><p class="Para">The non-Lorentzian transformations of the reference systems of a manifold can lead to a general map of the set of metrics into the set of vacuum metrics on the same manifold. Resulting new aspects in problems of gravitation theory are discussed.
We give solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations describing the emission of charged null fluid from a spherically symmetric body. The electromagnetic field is parallel to the direction of energy propagation, is of order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−2</sup> at infinity and is not null.
The requirement in scalar theories of gravitation that the source of the field includes the trace of its own stress tensor is investigated in two models: (1) The geometrical Nordstr0m theory, which is the conformally flat metric analog of Einstein's theory. (2) The ostensibly non-geometrical flat space system of Freund and Nambu. Both are derived in closed form as cubic self-interacting systems and shown to be equivalent.
The conservation laws based upon the existence of curvature and Ricci collineations are investigated and the results given recently by Katzin, Levine and Davis are reinterpreted and generalized. The concept of a ‘Maxwell collineation’ is introduced and corresponding conservation laws are found.

Geo-chronometric conventionalism (GC) is shown to be part of a more general thesis, universal conventionalism, stating that coordinative definitions are needed in order to compare two measurements of any physical quantity at different space-time points. Two fully elaborated examples of the use of non-standard coordinative definitions in physics are given, demonstrating that the use of these definitions can actually simplify the physical formalism.</p><p class="Para">Finally, we find that not only the metric of space-time is conventional (even non-Riemanian metrics are admissible), but also its topology and number of dimensions.





A definition of a causal boundary<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\dot V\)</span> is given by assigning a future and a past endpoint to any non-extensible timelike or null line. A topology and a partial ordering can be introduced on<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\bar V: = \dot V \cup V\)</span>. The usual conditions for the causal structure can be formulated as properties of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\dot V\)</span>. This boundary is compared with other types of boundaries.

To any space time a boundary is attached on which incomplete geodesics terminate as well as inextensible timelike curves of finite length and bounded acceleration. The construction is free of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> assumptions concerning the topology of the boundary and the identification of curves defining the same boundary point. Moreover it is a direct generalization of the Cauchy completion of positive definite Riemannian spaces.
The problem of singularities is examined from the stand-point of a local observer. A singularity is defined as a state with an infinite proper rest mass density. The approach consists of three steps: (i) The complete system of equations describing a non-symmetric motion of a perfect fluid under assumption of adiabatic thermodynamic processes and of no release of nuclear energy is reduced to six Einstein field equations and their four first integrals for six remaining unknown components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gik</em>. (ii) A differential relation for the behavior of the rest mass density is deduced. It shows that any inhomogeneity and anisotropy in the distribution and motion of a non-rotating ideal fluid accelerates collapse to a singularity which will be reached in a finite proper time. Collapse is also inevitable in a rotating fluid in the case of extremely high pressure when the relativistic limit of the equation of state must be applied. In the case of a lower or zero pressure the relation does not give an unambiguous answer if the matter is rotating. (iii) The influence of rotation on the motion of an incoherent matter is investigated. Some qualitative arguments are given for a possible existence of a narrow class of singularity-free solutions of Einstein equations. Assuming rotational symmetry the Einstein partial differential equations together with their first integrals are reduced to a system of simultaneous ordinary differential equations suitable for numerical integration. Without integrating this system the existence of the class of singularity-free solutions is confirmed and exactly delimited. These solutions, representing a new general relativistic effect, are, however, of no importance for the application in cosmology or astrophysics. It is proved that in all the other cases interesting from the point of view of application the occurrence of a point singularity in incoherent matter with a rotational symmetry is inevitable even if the rotation is present.

















In a closed universe, every physical system has a discrete infra-structure consisting of closely spaced (Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E∼h</em> <sup>2</sup>/2mR<sup>2</sup>) energy eigen states. Basic physical principles such as the uncertainty relation as well as semi-empirical facts like the finiteness of the world age seem to exclude a detection of this structure.
The following new results are proved: (1) Every Riemannian space admitting a multiply transitive Lie algebra of Killing fields is locally isometric to a homogeneous Riemannian space. (2) For every closed connceted subgroup<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sup>0</sup> of the invariance group of a non degenerate quadratic form a homogeneous Riemannian space exists whose isotropy group contains<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sup>0</sup>. (3) Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a Lie algebra<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{G} \)</span> to have a realization as multiply transitive Killing fields. These conditions are constructire in the sense that, for a given linear connected isotropy group, Lie algebras<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{G} \)</span> can be calculated algebraically, (4) It is shown how the Riemann tensor of a bomogencous space and its covariant derivatives can be expressed in terms of the metric at one point and the structure constants of the Lie algebra of Killing fields.
In this paper the general non-static axially symmetric line element has been considered in the context of Petrov Classification. The space-time is found to be of various Petrov Types under different circumstances. The necessary algebraic conditions for such a space-time to be of class one have also been derived. It is found that there exists only one solution representing a plane symmetric class-one null-electromagnetic field.
Homogeneous isotropic models of the universe, based on the general theory of relativity, lead to the existence of a preferred frame of reference, which is similar to the absolute space of, Newton, and a preferred time coordinate, which resembles the absolute time of Newton. These concepts seem to be in contradiction to the principle of covariance on which the general relativity theory is based. A theory of gravitation is therefore proposed which uses the world picture of general relativity but is not covariant. In the three crucial tests, the proposed theory gives the same results as the general relativity theory. However, in contrast to general relativity, the present theory predicts the emission of gravitational waves by spherically symmetric systems, and gravitational waves are found, in general, to have both transverse and longitudinal components.




The balanced field equations [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">1</em>] of general relativity have been used for presenting a model for a sphere of charged dust having different densities of matter and charge. The Schwarzschild's and Penney's solutions are the particular case of the solution arrived at herein. Further equations are solved to get a model in which gravitational attraction and electrical repulsion balance each other.

The scattering of unpolarized Fermions and scalar mesons by single graviton exchange is considered by means of a Feynman graph type perturbation theory scheme. In the limit of scattering of the Fermions by very heavy mesons, one obtains the cross section for Fermions scattering in a Schwarzschild metric. The result obtained conflicts with an earlier result of Mitskevich. In the limit of scattering of massless Fermions (neutrinos) with massless scalar mesons it is seen, using Weinberg's treatment of soft graviton Bremsstrahlung, that the cosmological red shift of light cannot be explained by interactions of the light with intergalactic neutrinos.
This is a continuation of a previous paper, in which a theory of gravitation was developed based on the existence of a preferred frame of reference and a preferred time coordinate in the universe. The gravitational field equations are derived with the help of a variational principle containing three constants. Two relations among the constants are introduced, leaving one of them arbitrary. This constant does not affect the precession of the perihelion of Mercury but does affect the behaviour of gravitational waves. By changing one of the relations among the constants, one can account for the discrepancy in the precession of the perihelion associated with the oblateness of the sun, as found by Dicke and Goldenberg.

Based on an analysis first suggested by Bryce S. DeWitt, we have found that a special case of the general classical theory involving quadratic constraints can be quantized canonically, in the sense that the quantum constraints are consistent. In particular, this special case contains all known physical theories of bosons,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">including</em> Einstein's<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">General Theory of Relativity</em>. The quantum constraints for this theory are given explicitly in an appendix.



The gravitational field of a massless point particle is first calculated using the linearized field equations. The result is identical with the exact solution, obtained from the Schwarzschild metric by means of a singular Lorentz transformation. The gravitational field of the particle is nonvanishing only on a plane containing the particle and orthogonal to the direction of motion. On this plane the Riemann tensor has a δ-like singularity and is exactly of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>.
We define a derivation operation working on hybrid objects which are tensors under the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Einstein</em> group of coordinate transformations and under the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lorentz</em> group of transformations of reference systems. With these general covariant derivations we formulate the principle of the equivalence of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Einstein</em>- and of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lorentz</em>-covariant representations of the physical laws. This principle means the general covariant constance of the metric tetrads<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>i</sub> <sup>A</sup> </span> (Weyl's lemma).
The problem tackled by B. K. Datta, [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">1</em>] in a recent paper concerning non-static spherically symmetric systems in which the particle motion is, in a certain sense, purely transverse, is further developed and compared with the Newtonian case. A full classification of the possible motions is given.
Multipole moments have already been defined in general relativity independently for both field and source, but owing to the non-linearity of the theory these two concepts have not hitherto been related. Recently Sciama, Waylen and Gilman have found a pseudo-linear integral representation of Einstein's field equations. This representation is here used to find a relation between the multipole moments of field and source in the static case. The technique is to expand the Green's function of the representation in a series of eigenfunctions of an associated linear differential operator.
Given a curved space-time with a metric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ij</sub>, Maxwell's equations may be written as if they were valid in a flat space-time in which there is an optical medium with a constitutive equation.</p><p class="Para">When optical phenomena are considered, this medium turns out to be equivalent to the gravitational field. Optical phenomena in various gravitational fields are analysed and we find that the language of classical optics for the ‘equivalent medium’ is as suitable as that of Riemannian geometry.

It is shown that a large class of conformal transformations of the metric tensor on a three-dimensional space-like hypersurface leads to sandwich problems that result in elliptic differential equations for the unknown variables.
Since a homogeneous isotropic universe can be embedded in a flat space of five dimensions, the question is considered under what conditions a more general universe can be embedded in a five-dimensional flat space. On the assumption that the deviation from homogeneity is small, it is found that real inhomogeneities can occur only in the case of a universe filled with radiation, or a universe containing at least two different substances with different equations of state, as for example radiation and matter. In the case of a radiation-filled universe, the inhomogeneities can be of arbitrary size and can conceivably be the precursors of galaxies.
It is shown that for a spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution to be of class one, either (i) ε=0, or (ii) ε+R=0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> being respectively the eigenvalue of the Weyl tensor in Petrov's classification and spur of the Ricci tensor. Hence, it is deduced that whereas every conformally flat perfect fluid solution is of class one, the converse is not true in general. However, the converse does hold for all solutions with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ=3p</em>.


Static, axisymmetric, vacuum metrics (commonly called Weyl metrics) are classified according to the homothetic motions they admit, with all having more than two homothetic motions explicitly computed. Within the two new families of spacetimes so determined, none of the metrics is asymptotically flat. Although most of the horizons are unlike that of the Schwarzschild metric, it is shown that they nonetheless all fall within a classification scheme previously developed for two-dimensional static metrics. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> — metric and the question of directional singularities are also briefly considered.
An algebraic form of the energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field is derived in terms of two scalars and two mutually orthogonal vector fields. Upon inserting this tensor into the field equations, solutions of the co-determined Einstein-Maxwell equations are obtained. The line element used is that corresponding to a conformal flat universe, whose form is then uniquely determined by the field equations. The case of a charged fluid is also considered and it is found that the particular form of the velocity field chosen limits the choice of the possible equation of state connecting the pressure and density distributions.
The possibility of the existence of localized charged distribution giving rise to a special axially symmetric electrostatic field has been explored in Einstein's unified field theory [2]. The field equations have been studied in two particular cases. In one case the field equations have a solution representing flat space-time along with an electrostatic field which is constant in the direction of the axis of symmetry. For the other case the solution is non-existent.
The time-like geodesies of Robertson-Walker spaces have recently been considered by Noerdlinger from the Lagrangian point of view. In this paper the Hamiltonian point of view is adopted, to which end the characteristic function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> of an arbitrary Robertson-Walker space is determined by integrating the differential equations which govern<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>. Some particular examples are dealt with explicitly.
The algebraic programming system FORMAC is used to extend asymptotic solutions of the Newman-Penrose equations. The expansions are then applied to metrics with geodesic rays and to the Newman-Penrose conserved terms. It is shown how the expansion may prove useful in finding new solutions to the field equations.
New experiments are reported which improve our estimates of the bandwidth and energy flux of the observed radiation. These include search for coincident, sudden increases in power of newly instrumented detectors at 1661 Hertz and 1581 Hertz, at opposite ends of a 1000 kilometer baseline, and search for coincidences between outputs of detectors at 1661 Hertz and 5000 Hertz.

Space-times of class one for which the elementary divisors of the second fundamental tensor are real but not simple, do not admit perfect fluid distributions.
Exact solutions of the general relativistic field equations of Einstein and Maxwell have been found for a general static distribution of massive charged particles. As in the Newtonian case, the particles must have unit charge to mass ratio<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup>=1. The active gravitational mass of the system of particles is precisely the sum of individual masses of the constituent particles.
Mach's Principle is examined in the light of its recent formulation within General Relativity. It is argued that properties of geometry which Mach didn't envisage, specifically finite propagation velocity and independent field excitations, destroy the philosophic justification of Mach's Principle. What remains is a conjecture on which recent developments in cosmology throw doubt. A simpler and somewhat less Machian alternative proposed by Wheeler is also discussed briefly.
A detector of gravitational radiation is described, based on that of Weber but having enhanced time resolution.









A number of different expressions for the rotational energy of a slowly rotating star have appeared in the literature. Here it is shown that these expressions are equivalent. Application to pulsars and the Crab Nebulae are discussed.

Attention is drawn to dispersion relation techniques which are useful in calculating binding energies of light nuclei, mechanical form factors of particles and nuclei, and mean mass radii.

The systematic approximation technique of Synge is employed to construct a model of a spherical body at rest in the distant past and gradually attaining an angular velocity due to a modification of the internal stress. The calculations are carried out to include the second approximation so that, roughly speaking, there is an error of order m<sup>3</sup> in Einstein's field equations where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> is the mass of the sphere.
Spinor calculus is developed in a simple, axiomatic manner, without the use of fibre bundles. Tangent vectors of spacetime are identified with self-adjoint endomorphisms of spin spaces. Only one spin space is defined at each point, instead of the two which are required in traditional spinor calculus. The properties of the spin connection and spin curvature are derived. The spinor index formalism and the formalism of complex 3-vectors are discussed.
A method of finding approximations for the gravitational field of two non-radiative systems is given. The first system consists of a shrinking body with convex boundary, having certain symmetries. The second system consists of two shrinking bodies which, in the first approximation, approach each other along the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sub>1</sub>-axis with a certain constant relative velocity. The two bodies are assumed to have rotational symmetry around the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sub>1</sub>-axis.
The gravitational field equations of general relativity theory are cast into a Yang-Mills-type theory by use of the group SL(2,C). The spin coefficients take the rôle of the Yang-Mills-like potentials, whereas the Riemann tensor takes the rôle of the fields.
The status and physical importance of the question “Can the energy of gravitational fields be negative?” is discussed. To study this question further a particular model of a gravitational shock wave has been developed. The energy corresponding to this model is a scalar functional of the two-geometry of the shock front. Values of the energy for special choices of the shock front have been calculated. These cases all give rise to positive energy, the energy becoming more positive as the shock front becomes more curved. However, no general proof is known to show that the energy is positive for all choices of two-geometries.
A recent analysis by Richard Price of spherical collapse with small nonspherical perturbations is here generalized to the case of an electrically charged collapsing star (0¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>¦-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>). The perturbations are confined to a scalar field generated by a nonspherical distribution of “scalar charge” in the star. As in the electrically neutral case, the scalar perturbations are probably a prototype for all others — electromagnetic, gravitational, and higherspin. The collapse is shown to produce a Reissner-Nordström black hole, and the scalar-field perturbations are shown to radiate completely away; but they die out more slowly the larger is the star's electric charge. For charge ¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, the ℓ-pole part of the perturbation at fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> and late times is dominated by a “tail” that dies out as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>−(2ℓ+ 2)</sup>. But for ¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>¦=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, the primary outgoing waves emitted from the star's surface are everywhere larger than the “tail”. At fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> and late times they die as t<sup>−(ℓ+2)</sup>. Also, a calculation of the redshift shows that a collapsing star becomes “black” more slowly the larger is the star's electric charge.
The equation of geodesic deviation is derived under the assumption that the geodesics are neighbouring, but their rate of separation is arbitrary, corresponding, physically, to the relative velocity of two test particles approaching that of light. Some of the consequences of the new equation are discussed.
Modelling of the gravitational field is discussed within the framework of Einstein's theory. Modelling is defined as the mapping whereby the geodesic lines (the path of test bodies) go into the family of curves given by the equation of a test body motion in a model. Different possible ways of modelling are singled out — namely, the complete, selective, and approximate-selective ones. The theory is applied to the solar gravitational field.
The Goos and Hänchen experiments of 1947 have shown that in total reflection the photons tunnel through the second medium (which we take to be the vacuum), whence a longitudinal shift Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>; Imbert's experiments of 1970 have shown that if the incident beam is circularly polarized there is also a transverse shift Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>, the sign of which depends on the helicity sign. We briefly explain this new phenomenon, first in terms of a generalized geometrical optics where the velocity and momentum of a spinning photon are non-collinear, then in terms of wave optics, using an appropriate class of solutions of Maxwell's equations.
A classification of plane-fronted pure gravitational waves in terms of “curvature collineations” is given.




Minimal and nonminimal gravitational couplings are discussed in terms of the translation gauge fields b<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub>μ, which are necessary to describe the gravitational interaction of the spin 1/2 field. For this purpose we carry out the extension of the conventional tetrad formalism of general relativity. Our general framework contains four arbitrary parameters; one of them represents the asymmetry of the affine connection (or equivalently that of the energymomentum tensor) and the others measure possible deviations from Einstein's gravitational Lagrangian, which will be responsible for spin effects. We also discuss the physical meaning of the invariance requirement with respect to the Poincaré gauge transformation that uniquely leads us within the present framework to Einstein's theory of gravity.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A class of solutions of Einstein's field equations is found in which the quantities can be expressed as power series in r.

The nonlinear equation for an abstract noncanonical 2-component Weyl spinor field — as used with the inclusion of internal symmetries in Heisenberg's nonlinear spinor theory of elementary particles — which is invariant under scale, phase, and Poincaré transformations is modified in such a way as to become invariant under spacetime dependent phase gauge and Poincaré gauge transformations. In such an equation a phase gauge field B<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub>, six Lorentz gauge fields A[κλ]<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and four translation gauge fields g<sub>μ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em></sub> have to be introduced. It is demonstrated that all these fields can be identified as certain combinations of the Weyl spinor field, and hence should be considered in a rough sense as ‘bound states’ of this spinor field. In particular the ‘electromagnetic field’ B<sub>m</sub> and the ‘gravitational field’ g μ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> appear as S-states and P-states of a spinor-antispinor system. The noncanonical property and the operator character of the spinor field is essential for this result. The relation between the translation gauge field and the spinor field involves a fundamental length. In a classical geometrical interpretation this relation leads to Einstein's equation of gravitation without cosmological term in a Riemannian space without torsion if the fundamental length is identified with Planck's length. It is shown that this equation is covariant under the larger symmetry group of phase gauge and Poincaré gauge transformations. The modified nonlinear equation constructed solely from a single 2-component Weyl field hence seems to incorporate in an extremely compact way ‘electromagnetic’ and ‘gravitational’ interaction in addition to non-mass-zero interactions. In this equation no arbitrary dimensionless constants enter. The considerations can be generalized to Dirac spinor fields and to spinor fields involving additional interior degress of freedom.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">An extension of Israel's theorem on the regularity of Killing horizons is proven.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">Flows of a perfect fluid in which the flow-lines form a time-like shear-free normal congruence are investigated. The space-time is quite severely restricted by this condition on the flow: it must be of Petrov Type I and is either static or degenerate. All the degenerate fields are classified and the field equations solved completely, except in one class where one ordinary differential equation remains to be solved. This class contains the spherically symmetric non-uniform density fields and their analogues with planar or hyperbolic symmetry. The type D fields admit at least a one-parameter group of local isometries with space-like trajectories. All vacuum fields which admit a time-like shear-free normal congruence are shown to be static. Finally, shear-free perfect fluid flows which possess spherical or a related symmetry are considered, and all uniform density solutions and a few non-uniform density solutions are found. The exact solutions are tabulated in section 7</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is shown by using the equation of geodesic deviation that a small test particle, placed in the centre of inertia of a terrestrial spherical satellite, will vibrate if a small initial momentum</em> dξ<sup>i</sup>/ds<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">be given to this particle at a certain moment of the satellite's proper time S=0. These vibrations may be in the satellite's orbital plane and the plane perpendicular to it with the frequencies determined by the formulae (14) and (16). The difference between the periods of these vibrations determined by the formula (20) is one new effect of the Einsteinian theory of gravitation (GTR). The shifting of the point of intersection on the lines of these vibrations corresponds to this difference of periods (20).

EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is well known that the Einstein-Maxwell field eguations are the Euler-Lagrange equations associated with a particular Lagrange density. It is also well known that, in a four-dimensional space, the Einstein-Maxwell field equations give rise to the Rainich conditions (which can be divided into two types, the algebraic and the differential Rainich conditions). In this note it is shown that the algebraic Rainich conditions are inevitably the consequence of every Euler-Lagrange equation associated with each member of a special class of Lagrange densities. However, in general, these Euler-Lagrange equations are not the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, although the Lagrange density associated with the latter is a particular member of this class</em>.

There is considerable freedom in the definition of multipole moments of the energy-momentum tensor of an extended body in general relativity. By studying the corresponding Newtonian theory we obtain guidelines which enable us to choose the most suitable definitions in the relativistic theory. In this way we find two sets, the complete moments and the reduced moments, of which the latter are the most natural choice for studying the dynamics of extended bodies. Expressions as explicit integrals are give for both sets, and the multipole equations of motion of the body are given in a form exact to all orders. Proofs of the relativistic results will appear elsewhere.
An algebraic classification of neutrino fields in curved space-times is found. Several classes are simplified by assuming a positive energy density. These classes then correspond algebraically to null and non-null electromagnetic fields. The uniqueness of the neutrino fields for these classes is discussed.
Einstein field equations will be assumed in a certain restricted form. The problem to be solved consists, roughly, of the enumeration of all curvature tensors which satisfy these equations.
In this article it is shown that the equation derived by weber from the equation of geodesic deviation — the equation that constitutes the basis for the theoretical studies concerning the detection of gravitational waves — can be obtained as an approximation to an equation deduced from Cauchy's equation which governs an elastic continuum. This is achieved within the frame of the formalism of the theory of relativistic continua developed by A. C. Eringen and his collaborators and the present author. The use of piezoelectric crystals in order to measure the stresses that result from incident gravitational waves is also examined within the framework provided by this theory.
An exact cylindrically symmetric solution of Einstein's gravitational field equations is given for a null fluid imploding radially along an infinite axis. This solution plays an important rôle in the late stages of collapse of a long cylinder of matter. One might expect that self-gravitational effects due to the increasingly relativistic mass of the collapsing matter would create arbitrarily large gravitational fields. It is shown, however, that in the null-fluid approximation the metric is everywhere regular.

We show that when the Einstein field equations for the gravitational field are modified by imposing the deDonder coordinate conditions these equations can be ‘solved’ in terms of source functions using the retarded Green's function for the d'Alembertian in flat space. The ‘solution’, which becomes an actual solution in the fast-motion approximation, is shown to satisfy the deDonder conditions if and only if the stress-energy tensor of the sources of the gravitational field is covariantly conserved. It is also shown to satisfy the Trautman outgoing radiation condition.
It is shown that ‘changes of topology’ (of spacelike sections) in the spacetime of classical general relativity are consistent with the following requirements: (i) stable causality, (ii) future causal geodesic completeness, and (iii) finite, positive energy density. This amounts to showing that the framework of classical general relativity encompasses ‘changes of topology’.
Using new methods based on first order techniques, it is shown how sharp theorems for existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the Cauchy data for the exterior Einstein equations can be proved simply and directly. Our main tools are obtained from the theory of quasilinear first order symmetric hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations. Einstein's equations in harmonic coordinates are cast into this form, thus achieving a certain uniformity of the description of gravity with other systems of partial differential equations occurring frequently in mathematical physics. In this symmetric hyperbolic form, the Cauchy problem for the exterior equations is easily resolved. Similarly, using first order techniques, a uniqueness theorem can be proved which increases by one the degree of differentiability of the coordinate-transformation between two solutions of Einstein's equations with the same Cauchy data. Finally it is shown how the theory of first order symmetric hyperbolic systems admits a global intrinsic treatment on manifolds.
In the general theory of relativity the active mass M of a static source can be written exactly as an integral over a certain linear combination of the diagonal components of the stress-energy tensor. Two corresponding integrals are found within the framework of the Brans-Dicke theory which give the values of those two constants characterizing the source which alone enter into the metric tensor at points sufficiently remote from the source. After dealing with some concomitant results it is shown that the Brans-Dicke equations do not admit everywhere regular, static, asymptotically flat vacuum solutions.
Conservation laws for dynamical systems in Riemannian space-time in the Vierbein formalism are deduced from the existence of motions in the space-time. The result is applied to Dirac's equation in General Relativity.

The extension of GR consists in the introduction of torsion S<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sup> as a new field. By variation of the action function with respect to metric and torsion we obtain the field equations in a general form (section<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2.3</em>). They are also valid for matter described by spinors; in this case, however, one has to introduce tetrads as anholonomic coordinates and slightly to generalize the dynamical definition of energy-momentum (sections<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2.4,5</em>).
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is shown that for spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with spatial isotropy and uniform density, the</em> free gravitational field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">produces a singularity at the centre of the sphere and when this singularity is removed</em> the space-time is conformally flat.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is pointed out that the interior geometry of the fluid spheres with uniform density given by Thompson and Whitrow, and others, is conformally flat, and hence the spacetime is of class one</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It has been extablished that no gravitational interaction is possible with a massive scalar field for a special ‘class one’ metric</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The physical situation of a star emitting neutrinos is considered. Some difficulties in the classical theory are mentioned, and a more detailed approach to the properties of neutrino radiation in general relativity is given. The classical theory is here regarded as a one-particle theory, and by summing over many particles propagating in randon radial directions, the energy-momentum tensor of the total radiation field is shown to approximate to the ‘geometrical optics’ type satisfying other conditions defining its radial and time dependence</em>.

Classical thermodynamics has been developed with the assumption that, either no gravitational fields are present in the thermodynamic systems, or that the fields act on the Newtonian mass of the systems only and not on any other kind of internal energy like heat. In order to find the exact thermodynamic relations for systems with gravitational fields, the wellknown Carnot cycles are used, taking into account the action of gravitation. The gravitation is described by general relativity. The Carnot efficiency is calculated in the case of stationary fields. Temperature for general relativistic systems can be defined with the help of Kelvin's principle analogously to classical thermodynamics, and the Carnot efficiency can then be expressed with temperatures instead of heat energies. In the case of strong gravitational fields, the Carnot efficiency can become equal to one even if the temperatures are both different from zero. Thermodynamic equilibrium can be expressed by using the Carnot efficiency, and it can be proved that for equilibrium the Tolman relation<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(T\sqrt {g00} \)</span> = constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">holds quite generally for systems with stationary gravitational fields</em>.


EmphasisTypeItalic ">The Fermi transport law is commonly used to construct “non-rotating” reference frames. The basis for this interpretation is the bouncing photon experiment ([1], p.</em> 123),<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">and the vanishing of the Coriolis acceleration ([4]). We use the latter property to construct a transport law for spatial axes along an observer's world line in theories of gravitation more general than Weyl's (and Einstein's). Insistence on a transport law built on the first property precludes any generalization beyond Weyl's</em>.
This paper is concerned with space-time manifolds that are space- and time-oriented, causal, and possess spinor structures. Five propositions are proven: (1) If a connected, space- and time-oriented manifold is simply con-nected, then it is non-compact; (2) If such a manifold is simply connected, it admits a spinor structure, which, moreover, is unique; (3) If the space-like section of M is compact, then there exists a global system of orthonormal tetrads on M; (4) The necessary and sufficient condition for every space-time M whose space-like section is compact to admit a spinor structure is that M have a global system of orthonormal tetrads; (5) Every space-time M which can be imbedded in R<sup>6</sup> admits a spinor structure. It is further suggested that in view of the fact that the existence of a spinor structure is related to homotopy properties, space-time manifolds may be classified in terms of their homotopy groups π<sub>i</sub> (M), i=1,2, 3,4. In a concluding section, some avenues for future research are discussed.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A bi-metric theory of gravitation is proposed, satisfying the covariance and equivalence principles. It is based on a simple form of Lagrangian and has a simpler mathematical structure than that of the general theory of relativity. The theory agrees with general relativity up to the accuracy of the observations made up to now. The static spherically symmetric solution of the present field equations does not involve any 'black hole'</em>.
The five-dimensional relativity theory proposed by Kaluza is formulated covariantly for a Riemannian space containing a Killing geodesic vector field. From this five-dimensional space a four-dimensional physical space is extracted. The field equations in empty 5-space are essentially uniquely determined and correspond to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in 4-space. In the presence of a field in 5-space the field equations involve a tensor which is associated with energy, momentum, charge and current densities in 4-space. For a 5-space containing dust the field equations lead to particle motion described by the geodesic equations. The latter correspond in 4-space to the Lorentz equations of motion for particles with arbitrary ratios of charge to mass and also for certain entities (tachyons and luminons) unobserved hitherto.
All solutions of the vacuum relativistic scalar-tensor field equations R<sub>μυ</sub>=−φ,μφ,υ are given in the case where the Weyl tensor is of Petrov-Penrose type N. These eight solutions are listed according to the Petrov-Plebański classification of their trace-free Ricci tensor components and belong to the three classes[T−3S]<sub>[1−1]</sub> (R,N), [3T−S]<sub>[1−1]</sub>(R,N) and [4N]<sub>[2]</sub>(O,N).
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A relativistic, collisionless gas of gravitating particles all having the same proper mass (possibly equal to zero) is studied under the assumption that the oneparticle distribution function is locally ellipsoidal in momentum space with respect to some timelike vector field (observer). Liouville's equation implies that the distribution function depends only on a quadratic form in the 4- momenta, whose coefficients are a Killing tensor in the case of non- vanishing proper mass, and a conformal Killing tensor in the case of vanishing rest mass of the particles. It is suggested that cosmological models of Bianchi-type I can be described in terms of ellipsoidal momentum distribution functions whose ellipsoidal tensor is built out of the Killing vectors associated with the spatial homogeneity</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The problem of finding algebraically special solutions of the vacuum Einstein-Maxwell equations is investigated using the spin coefficient formalism of Newman and Penrose.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The constraints equations of General Relativity are reduced on an initial maximal submanifold, by the use of conformai techniques, to a non-linear elliptic equation for the conformal factor φ. Some existence, uniqueness, and nonexistence theorems are proved for this equation, in the case of closed manifolds, and also for open manifolds (in particular for manifolds homeomorphic to</em> ℝ<sup>3</sup>).
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The theorem of Israel which characterizes the Reissner-Nordström solutions as the only well behaved asymptotically flat electrovac spaces with a simple regular horizon is extended by weakening the assumptions. Critical points of the gravitational potential are not a priori excluded and the topology of the eguipotential surfaces is not restricted. The regularity of the horizon is formulated in terms of bounds for certain geometrical quantities and the assumption of existence, in some extension, of a bifurcation surface for the horizons is not made. The possibilities of non-static or non-conservative electromagnetic fields in a static space-time are discussed and excluded by physical arguments</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">An outline of recent applications of modern infinitedimensional manifold techniques to general relativity is presented. The uses, scope, and future of such methods are delineated. It is argued that the mixing of the two active fields of general relativity and global analysis provides stimulation for both fields as well as producing good theorems. The authors' work on linearization stability of the Einstein equations is sketched out to substantiate the arguments</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A new approach to the problem of motion in General Relativity, based upon the systematic approximation procedure of Synge, is presented. The equations of transnational motion for a system of spherical bodies moving under their mutual gravitational attractions are derived. Approximations are based upon the weakness of the field and on the distance between any two of the bodies being considered large by comparision with their radii. The most general stress distribution consistent with maintaining the symmetry of the bodies throughout the motion is chosen. The use of controlled errors enables us to derive equations of motion applicable to a wider class of physical systems than the original equations of Einstein, Infeld and Hoffmann and Fock-Papapetrou</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">In this paper a non-static generalization of the Schwarzschild interior solution has been obtained which is conformal to flat space-time</em>.
When the field equations of general relativity are expanded in powers of a small parameter, the general covariance of the exact theory implies a corresponding gauge invariance of the equations obtained in the expansion. In a slow motion expansion, the derivation of this gauge transformation is complicated by the fact that the time coordinate is singled out for special treatment. In a previous paper, a new (3 + 1)-dimensional decomposition of the field equations was obtained which is particularly suitable as a starting point for slow motion approximations. The present paper gives a systematic method, again using covariant techniques throughout, for obtaining the corresponding gauge transformations to arbitrarily high accuracy. The calculations are explicitly carried out as far as is required in the 2 1/2-post-Newtonian approximation.
It is shown that the algebraic symmetry properties of the Riemann tensor can be expressed by a single tensor equation.

The algebraic structures of both the Ricci and Weyl tensors, given that of the second fundamental tensor, are tabulated. In particular, the Weyl tensor is algebraically special if and only if the second fundamental tensor is algebraically special. A class one perfect fluid is found to possess at least one of the following properties: (a) conformai flatness; (b) the flow is geodesic; (c) it admits a three-dimensional group of isometries with two-dimensional space-like trajectories. All solutions with property (b) are obtained explicitly.
A class of space-times without spin-structure is discussed. It is shown that these space-times admit a globally defined structure which is locally equivalent to a spin structure. ‘Generalised spinors’ can be defined, locally indistinguishable from ordinary spinors, which suffice for defining particle fields.
A dispersion relation is derived for gravitational radiation emitted from an almost spherical object.

The object of this paper is to relate three equations in the Newman-Penrose system of equations to the conservation laws and, hence, to the equations of motion. To do so, the corresponding result is first obtained using the Einstein equations in a null coordinate system. The Newman-Penrose equations are then analyzed. They are separated into hypersurface, propagation, supplementary, and conservation equations. When all field equations except the three conservation equations have been appropriately satisfied, the desired result follows.



EmphasisTypeItalic ">In this paper the external field of a bounded source emitting electromagnetic and gravitational radiation has been considered. The field has been assumed to be axially symmetric as well as reflexion symmetric and that it tends to flatness at infinity. The form of the electromagnetic tensor which is in accordance with the classical harmonic electric dipole radiation has been assumed. It has been shown that the whole set of field equations falls into seven ‘main equations’ together with three supplementary conditions. These field equations have been solved by multipole expansion method and the corresponding Initial Value Problem has been discussed</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is shown that the continuity conditions of Lichnerowicz must generally be relaxed in favour of the O'Brien-Synge conditions in the case of shock electromagnetic waves. This is in particular true when two electromagnetic shock waves are in collision. Gravitational impulse waves are produced as a result of the weakened conditions. An exact solution exhibiting this behaviour is derived, and the effect of the impulse waves on a measuring device are compared with experimental results of Weber.

In this paper the Friedmann universes containing<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(i)</em> a massless real scalar field,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(ii)</em> a massive real scalar field,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(iii)</em> electromagnetic fields,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(iv)</em> the combined massive complex scalar and electromagnetic fields are investigated. In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(i)</em> the field has to be either purely spatial or else purely temporal and the latter case is completely solved. Similarly in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(ii)</em> the purely time-dependent case has been reduced to a single fourth order ordinary differential equation. In this case graphs of the numerical solutions have been exhibited. In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(iii)</em> as expected, no non-trivial solution exists. In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(iv)</em> all possible cases are studied. In case the complex wave function is a product of two non-constant functions, i.e. ψ=ξ(r)τ(t), there exists no solution. In the subcase gx(r)=ξ<sup>*</sup>(r)=constant, ¦τ(t)¦=constant the problem is completely solved. In the subcase ξ(r)=ξ<sup>*</sup>(r)=constant and ¦τ(t)¦ is non-constant, the system of equations boil down to the same fourth order ordinary differential equation as mentioned before. In the last two sub-cases, the time-dependent wave field carries electric charge density which, strangely enough, is decoupled from the electromagnetic fields.

A criterion for stability of a charged sphere is obtained by use of two different methods. The result is applied to a charged dust in order to investigate its stability.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The most general Lagrange density (which is a concomitant of the metric tensor together with a vector field and its first derivatives) for which the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are precisely Maxwell's equations is obtained.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The concept of periodic fields in the framework of five-dimensional relativity is introduced in a 5-covariant manner.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid with infinite conductivity is modified slightly by attributing a proper energy content to a field of tension, as proposed by Cattaneo, for a perfect nonconducting fluid, and it is shown that with this modification the velocities of the hydrodynamic waves in the fluid do not exceed C. This contrasts with the standard theory in which a lower limit must be placed on the compressibility of the fluid to prevent the velocity of the ‘fast’ hydrodynamic wave fron exceeding c. The velocity of the Alfvén wave is changed only slightly and is always less than c as in the standard theory</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The equivalence of the Feynman rules for gauge fields and the usual Feynman rules is demonstrated, by explicit calculation, for the special case of a scalar field with self-coupling. The result may be applicable to more general cases, such as the quantum theory of gravity</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Using the natural, real units (proper time and proper length) for the definition of the spatial velocity, it is shown that the velocity of light during its propagation through gravitational fields is constant and exactly equal to its value in vacuum. Therefore, according to General Relativity, it is not correct to speak about a variable velocity of light in gravitational fields</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Source-free Maxwell equations are equivalent to the scalar wave equation. Most of its solutions are singular at infinity. If the nail eigenvector of the background metric is an eigenvector of the Maxwell field, too, the e.m. field is not changed by the plane wave</em>.

An investigation is made of Rainich's ‘already unified field theory’ from the standpoint of continuous groups of motions, and a solution is obtained for the case where the electromagnetic field is non-static and the space-time admits a three-parameter continuous group of motions whose minimum invariant varieties are three-dimensional spaces. There exists a divergence-free electromagnetic field for values of t at which the metric is not singular.

The topological and geometrical restrictions on spatially integrable space-times foliated by space-like hypersurfaces are investigated.
Several topics in the geometry of space-times are discussed, including the time and space-distributions of the space-time and a geometrical definition of singularities.
The equations of motion of a spinning body in the gravitational field of a much larger mass are found using both the Corinaldesi-Papapetrou spin supplementary condition (SSC) and the Pirani SSC. These equations of motion are compared with our previous result derived from Gupta's quantum theory of Gravitation. It is found that the spin-dependent terms differ in each of the above three results due to a different location of the center of mass of the spinning body. As expected, these terms are not affected by the choice of either Schwarzschild or isotropic coordinates. Finally, for the presently planned Stanford gyroscope experiment, we find the maximum secular displacement of the orbit of the gyro with respect to the orbit of its non-rotating housing to be of the order of (10<sup>−7</sup> cm/year)t, a result much smaller than Schiff's result which is proportional to time squared.
A pair (M, Γ) is defined as a Riemannian manifold M of normal hyperbolic type carrying a distinguished time-like congruence Γ. The spatial tensor algebra<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">D</span> associated with the pair (M, Γ) is discussed.

We present a singularity theorem for a certain class of space-times. The theorem contains an ‘energy’ condition stronger than Hawking's, but does not require any condition about Cauchy surfaces, normals or time orientability.

Linearized theory suggests that the NUT solution of Einstein's equations corresponds to a source with both mass and dual mass i.e. to a gravitational dyon. This is born out by the striking identity between the Killing operators of the NUT solution and the ‘total angular momentum’ operators of the monopole. On this basis, Misner's periodic time condition is shown to be the analogue of the Dirac quantization, and results from the requirement that the generators integrate to a global Lie group. It is also shown that there are no bound states for a Klein-Gordon field in NUT space provided the field vanishes in the conventional way at the horizon. For this purpose a generalized ‘tortoise coordinate’ is introduced.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">In general, a first order Lagrangian gives rise to second order Euler-Lagrange equations. However, there are important examples where the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are of first order only, the Weyl neutrino equations being of this type. In this paper we therefore consider first order spinor Lagrangians which give rise to</em> first<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">order Euler-Lagrange equations. Specifically, the most general first order spinor field equations of rank one in curved space-time which are derivable from a first order Lagrangian of the same type are explicitly constructed. Subject to a certain restriction, the Weyl neutrino equation is the only possibility. Furthermore, if the spinor field satisfies the Weyl neutrino equation, then the associated energy momentum tensor is the conventional neutrino energymomentum tensor</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The dynamics of a gravity spin two field system is analysed when linear antisymmetric formulations for the ‘matter’ field is assumed and the minimal prescription for the interaction is made.

The relevance of considering the full interacting system (instead of treating gravity as external) is stressed throughout</em>.

The static plane symmetric solutoins of Einstein's field equations in the presence of massive scalar fields, and the difference between the massless and non-massless scalar fields are being investigated, and will be published separately later on. We also hope to discuss non-static plane symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in the presence of scalar fields in future</em>.

A criterion is given for two curves of finite generalized affine length to define the same point of the b-boundary of a space-time. It is shown that the b-boundary can be constructed on every closed subbundle of the bundle of linear frames to which the Levi-Civita connection is reducible. It follows that, for any product space-time, the space-time together with its b-boundary is homeomorphic to a product of pseudo-Riemannian spaces with b-boundary. Furthermore, it is shown that maps of one space-time in to another which are isomorphisms of the connections can be C<sup>0</sup>-extended to the space-time with b-boundary. In particular, it follows that the group of affine transformations and the group of isometries of a space-time act as topological transformation groups on the spacetime with b-boundary.

The infinitesimal mappings form the germ of the group of finite mappings of equivalence classes on each other that change the form of the symplectic tensor field. Any non-canonical coordinate system on phase space thus obtained defines a scalar density field that is constant over an equivalence class.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is sometimes said that, if the universe were not expanding, we all would burn up, (Olbers' paradox).

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The renormalizability of quantum gravity remains an open question while it has been established recently that quantum gravity in the presence of standard sources is non-renormalizable. In view of traditional confusion and ambiguities surrounding non-renormalizable quantum field theories, it has been felt that physical theories must be renormalizable. Recently a new, nonperturbative view of non-renormalizable theories has been suggested that may have relevance for various interactions including gravity and various sources. In a path integral approach to quantum field theory such a view attributes ‘hard cores’ in the space of field histories to non-renormalizable interactions. Just as with more familiar ‘hard cores’, turning off the interaction does not completely remove all effects of the potential. Consequently the interacting theory is not even continuously connected to the usual free theory, but rather to an alternative ‘pseudo-free’ theory that incorporates the vestiges of the ‘hard cores’. Some insight into what is the significance and interpretation of non-renormalizable interactions can be gleaned from exactly soluble models. Application of this philosophy of non-renormalizable interactions is discussed for the gravitational field in interaction with some standard sources</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Renormalization in the theory of a quantized scalar field interacting with the classical Einstein gravitational field is discussed. The scalar field obeys the generalization of the Klein-Gordon equation which is conformally invariant in the limit of vanishing mass. A generalized Kasner metric corresponding to an anisotropic expansion of the universe is considered. Results obtained in collaboration with S.A. Fulling and B.L. Hu are described, which show explicitly how the infinities appearing in the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor can be absorbed through renormalization of the cosmological constant and the coefficients of a quadratic tensor appearing in a slightly generalized form of the Einstein equation. There is also a finite renormalization of the gravitational constant</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is proposed to combine the scalar-tensor theory of gravitation with the hypothesis of ‘spontaneously broken scale invariance’, which has been developed in quantum field theory and seems to give a better understanding of the origin of the masses of elementary particles. The general theoretical background of this approach is reviewed. In our model theory we predict that the Newtonian gravitational potential acquires an anomalous part with a force-range typically of the order of</em> 10<sup>5</sup> cm.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The experimental consequences are also discussed</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">A new scalar field, called a measure field, is proposed which plays a rôle of measure assigned to each world point. By measuring all the quantities with a standard given by the above mentioned measure field, it is shown to be possible to write all the field equations in a manifestly gauge-invariant manner. Weyl's gauge field, when it is written in this fashion, is proved to have a negative energy density and has a tachyon-like property inside material particles. It is shown, however, that such a strange field can not come out of the matter</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">This conception is mainly based on the identity principle of mass, but centered on a purely gravitational basis.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">A new approach to the two-body problem is introduced which entails the perturbation of an initially static configuration. It is demonstrated that Einstein's theory demands that the bodies move when the equilibrium-sustaining stress is weakened. Radiation from the system, both during the stress-breaking and free-fall period are discussed. For free-fall, the non-linearities could greatly alter the energy loss rate from that predicted by the ‘quadrupole formula’</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">We consider, in lowest order of the gravitational coupling constant G, the gravitational potential between two neutrons. As we have previously pointed out</em> [1],<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the quantum (including spin) contributions to the gravitational field dominate for distances smaller than the Compton wavelength of the neutron. At such distances the gravitational force between two neutrons may be repulsive. In particular, the gravitational forces which are analogous to the familiar Darwin and Fermi forces of quantum electrodynamics are capable of stopping gravitational collapse. Our discussion is within the framework of Einstein's theory, but on a microscopic level. We conclude that gravitational collapse may be halted without the necessity of extending Einstein's theory à la Cartan or otherwise</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">An analysis of the complete Schwarzschild manifold M is performed. The Finkelstein time is assumed to order the events causally, instead of the Kruskal time. As a consequence of this assumption, the mutual causal behavior of the four Schwarzschild regions contained in M allows one to conceive of a dynamical mechanism which could produce the main features of M in some region of spacetime. Assuming the strong principle of equivalence, one predicts a significant blue shift of the radiation emitted by matter emerging from the r</em> = 0<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">singularity. This phenomenon has not been observed. A way to reconcile the assumption that M is physical with the absence of blue shifts is to require only a weaker equivalence principle, namely the local validity of the principle of (special) relativity in any local inertial frame. From such an equivalence principle, which one cannot renounce without giving up the whole theory of relativity, it is possible to deduce the ratio between the frequencies (as measured by an observer at rest in the asymptotically flat domain) emitted by two identical transmitters at the Schwarzschild times at which they reach the same 3-space point of the exterior Schwarzschild region along different geodesics. A physical interpretation of the peculiar feature of M of being the union of four regions with an</em> infinite<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">space-like extension is suggested. Such an interpretation is mainly based on a general relativity generalization of the space-time previously introduced in the special relativity theory of superluminal frames</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">The view is taken that the field equations of General Relativity, without a definition of congruence of length and time intervals at different events, are without physical content. The possibility is explored that the customary Einstein field equations are to be used but with a different congruence definition than is customary. When these resulting equations are, in turn, expressed with the customary congruence, they comprise a new set of field equations physically not equivalent to either Einstein's or Brans-Dicke's formulations of general relativity. Similarities with Einstein's and Brans-Dicke's formulations are discussed, and the possibility of experimental confirmation of these new equations is also briefly considered</em>.
Gravitational tensor fields E<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> and H<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> in vacuum are introduced and the case of radiation is formulated, in analogy with electromagnetism.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The author's geometrical theory of the scalar-tensor gravitational field is extended by formulating it in terms of a Lagrangian. An exact solution of the coupled nonlinear field equations for a static point mass is also presented. This theory which is conformally equivalent to the</em> empty space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Einstein equations predicts the same results for experiments as the usual theory of Brans and Dicke which has a non-zero energy momentum tensor</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A twisting shear free solution of Maxwell's equations is obtained by transforming to a complex coordinate system in which the corresponding solution is complex but twist free. The equations in this system are easily solved, and, by transforming back to the original coordinates, a twisting shear free solution of Maxwell's equations is obtained</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Among the variety of all conceivable metric theories of gravitation, Lorentz curvature dynamics is the most geometric extension of Einstein's field equations to fit the solar system data. In this framework two parameters determine the asymptotic form of a static spherically symmetric space-time (without imposing Einstein's conditions); these two parameters are the active gravitational mass of the source and the PPN parameter γ. The Lorentz connection is shown to satisfy covariant evolution equations which preserve either of these two parameters; furthermore, right and left oriented space-times differ in their Lorentz connection. Deviations from the Schwarzschild character find an interpretation in terms of a new object, the Lorentz curvature energy-momentum tensor, which always vanishes identically under the restriction of Einstein's conditions. These deviations contribute strongly to the gravitational force only in the neighbourhood of the Schwarzschild sphere</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">By means of a formal solution to the Einstein gravitational field equations a slow motion expansion in inverse powers of the speed of light is developed for the metric tensor. The formal solution, which satisfies the deDonder coordinate conditions and the Trautman outgoing radiation condition, is in the form of an integral equation which is solved iteratively. A stress-energy tensor appropriate to a perfect fluid is assumed and all orders of the metric needed to obtain the equations of motion and conserved quantities to the</em> 21/2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">post-Newtonian approximation are found. The results are compared to those obtained in another gauge by S. Chandrasekhar. In addition, the relation of the fast motion approximation to the slow motion approximation is examined</em>.

EmphasisTypeItalic ">We consider the problem of a particle in a square potential well in a one-dimensional closed universe. Imposition of periodic boundary conditions on the wave function changes the usual discrete energy levels to narrow but finite energy bands. Effects on the properties of atoms in a closed universe are estimated to be undetectable</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The bi-metric theory of gravitation proposed previously is simplified in that the auxiliary conditions are discarded, the two metric tensors being tied together only by means of the boundary conditions. Some of the properties of the field of a particle are investigated; there is no black hole, and it appears that no gravitational collapse can take place. Although the proposed theory and general relativity are at present observationally indistinguishable, some differences are pointed out which may some day be susceptible of observation. An alternative bimetric theory is considered which gives for the precession of the perihelion 5/6 of the value given by general relativity; it seems less satisfactory than the present theory from the aesthetic point of view</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The field equations of Rosen's bi-metric theory of gravitation [1] are solved exactly. The solutions are the same as in the author's theory of gravitation [2]. These solutions are, however, incompatible with Rosen's conservation laws and his second (flat) metric. Incompatibility with the conservation laws arises in second order. Incompatibility with the flat metric arises in first order but only for time-dependent fields. Rosen's theory is defensible only as a static first order theory and predicts the red shift light deflection and time-delay correctly</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The bi-metric theory recently proposed by Rosen is examined in the case of superdense static objects</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">An exact solution of Einstein's equations for an Electromagnetic field plus pure radiation is given in terms of the Kerr-Schild metric. The radiating Kerr solution and the Debney-Kerr-Schild solution are derived as particular cases</em>.
A number of theorems concerning non-null electrovac spacetimes, that is space-times whose metric satisfies the source-free Einstein-Maxwell equations for some non-null bivector F<sub>ij</sub>, are presented. Firstly, we suppose that the metric is invariant under a one-parameter group of isornetries with Killing vector field ξ. It is proved that the electromagnetic field tensor F<sub>ij</sub> is invariant under the group, in the sense that its Lie derivative with respect to ξ vanishes, if and only if the gradient α<sub>ij</sub> of the complexion scalar is orthogonal to ξ. It is is also proved that if in addition ξ is hypersurface orthogonal, it is necessarily parallel to α,<sub>i</sub>. These results are used to generalize theorems of Perjes and Majumdar concerning static electrovac space-times. Secondly, we suppose that the metric is invariant under a two-parameter othogonally transitive Abelian group of isometries. It is proved that in this case F<sub>ij</sub> is necessarily invariant under the group. The above results can be used to simplify many derivations of exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The main purpose of this paper is to present a formula of gravitational radiation recoil of an N-body material system</em>.

We show that linearized gravitational radiation produces fluctuations in intensity and position of a distant source if the ray travels in a dispersive medium. The effect, however, depends upon the nongeodesic character of the ray and does not occur in an electrostatic plasma. When the index of refraction n is greater than unity a Cerenkov type resonance produces scintillation proportional to D<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sub><sup>3/2</sup> (D<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sub> being the distance of the source) and a ‘dancing’ proportional to D<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sub><sup>1/2</sup> if, instead, n&lt;1 the scintillation behaves like D<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sub> and the dancing does not diverge as D<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sub>→ ∞. The calculation is performed in detail for a random and isotropic spectrum of gravitational waves W(ω). This effect allows one to set an upper limit to W(ω) at the frequency at which the fluctuations are observed, but for the rarified interstellar and intergalactic plasmas these limits are not very interesting.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The Einstein-Maxwell field equations for non-null electromagnetic fields are studied under the conditions that the null tetrad is parallelly propagated along both principal null congruences. It is shown that the resulting spacetime solutions are necessarily algebraically general. The twist-free solution found in a previous article is shown to be the most general twist-free solution. An expansionfree solution with twist and shear is also found</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">This paper is basically a review of known results in twistor theory. Its value is intended to lie in the connections presented between twistor concepts and structures in complex Minkowski space. The relationship of twistor theory to complex null infinity and a new proof of the Kerr theorem are presented; these results are to some extent original</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A family of solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations is presented, corresponding to the exterior of stationaryaxisymmetric sources with charge, mass, angular momentum, and magnetic dipole moment. The Riemann tensor vanishes asymptotically for each member of the family; some solutions are asymptotically flat and some have NUT-like behavior asymptotically. For the asymptotically flat solutions, the gyromagnetic ratio may vary from zero to one. The corresponding value for the Kerr-Newman solution is one. A method for generating infinite chains of families of solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations is described</em>.
It has been shown that the space-times formed from the product of two surfaces and from a thick gravitational plane wave sandwiched between two flat spacetimes admit proper curvature collineation in general. The curvature collineation vectors have been determined explicitly. For the space-time formed from the product of two surfaces conditions are obtained for it to admit motion. It has also been pointed out that the spacetime formed from a thick plane gravitational wave belongs to the class (III<sub>b</sub>) of pure gravitational radiation and admits five- and six-parameter groups of motion in the two possible cases. Conservation laws given by Sachs and Katzin-Levine-Davis in terms of curvature collineation vectors are satisfied identically in the case of the plane gravitational wave solution, and Sachs' conservation law can be deduced in this case as a consequence of the theorem given by Katzin and others.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Spherical charged matter distributions are examined in a coordinate-free manner within the framework of general relativity. Irrespective of models chosen to describe the interior structure of a charged particle, it is found that the latter's total gravitational mass is positive definite, being finite only when there exists a lower bound for its invariant extension. For a simple choice of matter and charge distributions it is then shown that there is a minimum invariant size for the particle, below which no solution of the field equations exists, the matter density becoming negative and the spacetime developing an intrinsic singularity in the exterior of the particle for radii less than this minimum. A mass renormalization is derived, valid at the moment of time symmetry, which relates the particle's total mass to its charge, bare mass and invariant extension. Our results are compared with those obtained previously by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner, who consider the simpler distribution of a charged spherical shell. Qualitatively, the two situations share the same features. However, in the more realistic spherical distributions the formulae are correspondingly more complicated, and the minimum extension is found to be greater than that of the shell, as one might expect on physical grounds. Moreover, the correspondence between negative valued matter distributions and intrinsic singularities was not evident in the shell case</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">A technique is described for constructing solutions of Einstein's equations for empty space, in which the Riemann tensor has a triply degenerate principal null direction with twist</em>.


The simplest manifestly covariant unitary representation of the Poincaré group for zero mass and spin 2 is constructed. This representation is carried by fourth rank tensors which satisfy the equations of the Riemann curvature tensor in the linearized theory of gravitation in vacuo. In particular, the requirement of unitarity implies the Bianchi identities.
A calculation is made of the effect of gravity waves on the observed Doppler shift of a sinusoidal electromagnetic signal transmitted to, and transponded from, a distant spacecraft. We find that the effect of plane gravity waves on such observations is not intuitively immediate and in fact can have surprisingly different spectral signatures for different spacecraft directions and distances. We suggest the possibility of detecting such plane waves by simultaneous coherent Doppler tracking of several spacecraft.
The algebraic presentation, of the curvature tensor suggested earlier in [1] yields a simple form of the energymomentum tensor, presupposed by the Sugawara model. This expression gives rise to the expression of the Yang-Mills fields in terms of tetrads. This provides for an interpretation of the Yang-Mills fields as classical counter-parts of inhomogeneous group generators. A generalized form for the Yang-Mills fields is obtained for which commutation relations of the field algebra follow naturally.
Universal classifying spaces and characteristic classes for O(p,q)-bundles are constructed and applied in the case (p,q) =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(1,3)</em> to the Lorentz bundle of a relativistic spacetime. The classes are used to investigate the existence of Uspinor structure on space and time orientable spacetimes, and spinor structures on nonorientable spacetimes.
It is shown that a photon emitted in the forward direction by a charged particle moving in an equatorial circular orbit centred on a highly collapsed mass M, the radius being slightly in excess of one and a half times the Schwarzschild radius, is strongly blueshifted when it arrives at a distant receiver. A ring shaped emitting region composed of such orbiting particles has a power law spectrum of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dν/ν</em> as seen by a distant stationary observer.
The BMS group can be realized as the group of diffeomorphisms preserving a certain geometrical structure on the Manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℝ×$</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sup>. This structure is equivalent to that of the angles and nullangles of (future or past) null infinity for asymptotically flat spacetimes.
A Riemannian space of embedding class two is characterised by two symmetric tensors a<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>, b<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> and a vector s<sub>i</sub>, satisfying the equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci. It is proved that the Gauss equations together with one set of Codazzi equations imply the other set of Codazzi equations and the Ricci equations, provided that the matrix of the tensor b<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> (or a<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>) is nonsingular. (The class m generalisation of the result has also been suggested). The result so proved has further been utilized in finding explicitly the a<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>'s and b<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>'s in the case of the static spherically symmetric line element. It is further indicated that the a<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>'s and b<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>'s so obtained are responsible for the different types of embeddings of the spacetime considered.
Despite the elegant formulations of Kundt and Thompson<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[1]</em>, and Robinson and Schild<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[2]</em>, it is not obvious how general the generalized GoldbergSachs theorem<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[3]</em> really is. A spacetime satisfying Einstein's equations with a null fluid source, for example, can elude the generalized theorem if, and only if, the null direction of the fluid is a fourfold repeated principal null direction of the Weyl tensor. An example of such a spacetime is presented.
This paper considers successively: Cosmological Determinism (as an approach to other possible determinisms), the concept of a Cosmic Space (as compared with other concepts of space), Time as being, according to GRG, of a richer nature and of a structure more complicated than thought of by Newton and Kant (especially: spacetime is not a space, but time itself), the idea of a unified theory (based either on the wish to synthesize different dynamics or on a principle that interactions should be unified). A consequence of these considerations is that, possibly, gravitation is not an interaction like other ‘usual’ interactions, much rather it would be an aspect of Time itself.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The formulation of gravitation theory in the light cone gauge is studied. After a brief discussion of Yang- Mills theory for purposes of illustration, tensor and scalartensor gravitation are investigated. We show that if the gauge conditions are properly chosen the constrained components of the metric tensor can be explicitly solved for by quadrature, so that the field theory can be reformulated entirely in terms of the physical transverse fields. It is also shown that the light cone gauge is useful for finding wave solutions of classical field equations. Occasional reference is made to dual models, primarily to explain our motivation, but familiarity with them is not required for an understanding of this paper</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">It is shown that the manifestly covariant quantization of gravity correctly reproduces the classical Reissner-Nordström solution in the ℏ → 0 limit. This is explicitly verified by evaluating the lowest order tree graph contribution to the vacuum expectation value of the gravitational field produced by a spherically symmetric c-number charged source. The generalization from a point source to that of finite extension is unavoidable if the ‘trees’ are not to lead to divergent expressions. Moreover, the mass which appears in the R-N solution is seen to be positive definite. For convenience, the source is taken to be a sphere of uniform charge and matter densities. Owing to a mass renormalization relating the total mass of the sphere to its bare mass, charge and invariant extension, both exterior and interior solutions may then be generated. This mass renormalization formula is in complete agreement with that obtained by purely classical reasoning</em>.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">The purpose of this paper is to bring to the attention of potential users the existence of algebraic computing systems, and to illustrate their use by reviewing a number of problems for which such a system has been successfully used in General Relativity. In addition, some remarks are included which may be of help in the future design of these systems</em>.
It is shown that to each choice of conformal factor for the conformal metric on future null Infinity (ℐ<sub>+</sub>) there is associated an equivalence class of slicings of ℐ<sub>+</sub>. Each slicing in turn gives rise to a family of null hypersurfaces in the physical space-time.
In connection with the problem of the initial singularity in the scalar-tensor anisotropic cosmology of Jordan-Brans-Dicke, the dynamics of homogeneous models of Bianchi type I is examined on the basis of the general analytic solutions in vacuo and in the presence of gravitating matter with state equations P=nɛ (0 ⩽ n ⩽ 1).</p><p class="Para">It is shown that the scalar homogeneous ϑ-field, as an effective source of the V<sub>4</sub>geometry, has to influence essentially the dynamics of the early anisotropic stage of the Universe's expansion, and significantly modifies the character of the initial singularity.</p><p class="Para">At negative ω (ω &lt; −6), the sourceless scalar ϑ-field may remove the singularity and provide regular ‘bouncing’ in the models with matter (P ⩽ ɛ/3) if it prevails over the tensor anisotropic mode of the vacuum gravitational field.



The essential structural features held in common by various classical formalisms are examined. Particular emphasis is placed on those aspects which survive in the transition to a corresponding quantum theory. In particular we develop in some detail the less familiar constraint formalism.


The hydrodynamic equations of motion for an electron gas in interaction with a radiation field are derived from the kinetic theory description of this system. Variational expressions for the transport coefficients appearing in these equations are obtained. The expressions for the transport coefficients are compared to the previously obtained expressions for these quantities and the differences are noted.
In this paper we generalize our previous work on the use of time-dependent projection operators for the derivation of master equations for general systems. Previously we had generalized the usual time-independent projection operator approach to include time-dependent projection operators, in which the “relevant” part of the full density operator is considered to be the uncorrelated part of the full density operator. The “irrelevant” part of the density operator was then the part describing the correlations between the coupled systems. In the present work we present new time-dependent projections operators which have the property that some correlations between the interacting subsystems are placed in the “relevant” part of the distribution function and the remaining correlations are placed in the “irrelevant” part of the distribution function.
We discuss the ergodic theoretic structure of infinite classical systems and present results on the ergodic properties of some simple model systems, e.g., ideal gas, Lorentz gas, Harmonic crystal. (The ergodic properties of the latter system are shown to be related in a simple way to the spectrum of the force matrix; when the spectrum is absolutely continuous, as in the translation-invariant crystal, the flow is Bernoulli.) We argue that ergodic properties, suitably refined by the inclusion of space translations, and other structure, are important for an understanding of nonequilibrium properties of macroscopic systems [1–5]. Possible additional structures include requirements of stability for the stationary state. We shall present results on the classical analog of the work by Haag, Kastler, and Trych-Pohlmeyer [6], Araki [7], and others [8]. The existence of a time evolution and equilibrium states for various anharmonic crystal systems will also be discussed [9].
We review briefly the status of some inverse problems in classical equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The use of spaces containing Grassman (anticommuting) coordinates (in addition to the usual space-time coordinates) as a framework for unified gauge theories is described. The theory developed represents a local gauge-invariant extension of conventional (global) supersymmetry. Aside from containing the usual general coordinate invariance group of gravitational theory, the gauge supersymmetry group is seen to also encompass other symmetries of particle physics, e.g., electromagnetic (or Yang-Mills) invariance. The role of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the field equations unifying the Einstein, Maxwell, and Dirac interactions are discussed.
A large class of questions in differential geometry involves the relationship between the geometry and the topology of a Riemannian (= positive-definite) manifold. We briefly review the status of the following question from this class: given that a compact, even-dimensional manifold admits a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvatures, what can one say about its topology? Very few manifolds are known to admit such metrics. For example, is it not known whether or not the product of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-sphere with itself (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> ≥ 2) does. One answer to the question above is provided by Synge's theorem: if the manifold is orientable, then it is simply connected. Another possible answer is given by the Hopf conjecture: such a manifold necessarily has positive Euler number. The Hopf conjecture is known to be true for homogeneous manifolds, and for arbitrary manifolds in dimensions two and four. This last result has two, apparently entirely different, proofs, one using Synge's theorem and the other the Gauss-Bonnet formula. Neither, it is shown, can be generalized directly to dimensions six or greater. The Hopf conjecture in these higher dimensions remains open.


Chemotactic bacteria like<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E. coli</em> respond to chemical gradients. The translational movements of individual cells can be traced. These are coupled to the rotation of the cell body. Both types of motions are regular in temporal attractant or repellent gradients. A corresponding regularity is observed for bacterial populations in spatial gradients. The distribution of a bacterial population is space and time may be described by a diffusion equation linked to the motions of single cells.

A new approach to quantized gravitational theory is suggested. It is argued by analogy with Maxwell theory-and also from a principle that (physical) gravitons should carry space-time curvature-that a free graviton should be describable by a complex solution of Einstein's vacuum equations. For a left-handed graviton (pure helicity state −2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ</em>) we require a solution which is of a particular kind, called right-flat, and which is of positive frequency. A construction is given for obtaining all such solutions, in terms of general curved (top halves of) twistor spaces.
Empty space algebraically special metrics possessing an expanding degenerate principal null vector and a Killing vector are investigated. It is shown that the Killing vector falls into one of two classes. The class containing all asymptotically timelike Killing vectors is investigated in detail and the associated metrics are identified. Several theorems concerning these metrics are given, among which is a proof that if the metric is regular and possesses an asymptotically timelike Killing vector, then it must be type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D.</em> In addition some relations between Killing vectors in general spaces are developed along with a set of tetrad symmetry equations stronger than those of Killing.
Properties of homothetic or self-similar motions in general relativity are examined with particular reference to vacuum and perfect-fluid space-times. The role of the homothetic bivector with components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[a;b]</em> </sub> formed from the homothetic vector<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">H</strong> is discussed in some detail. It is proved that a vacuum space-time only admits a nontrivial homothetic motion if the homothetic vector field is non-null and is not hypersurface orthogonal. As a subcase of a more general result it is shown that a perfect-fluid space-time cannot admit a nontrivial homothetic vector which is orthogonal to the fluid velocity 4-vector.
It is shown that if a nonflat vacuum space-time admits a homothetic vector field with a null homothetic bivector then that space-time is algebraically special. If that homothetic vector field is a nontrivial one (not a Killing one) then the space-time is Petrov type III or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>.
Sufficient topological conditions and some reasonable geometric properties near infinity are given on a partial Cauchy surface to study the occurrence of singularities and the topological structure of smooth event horizons. Conditions are given on electrovac space-times to show the horizon is a sphere without assuming the solution is stationary.
The astrophysical consequences of the blue-shifted radiation emitted in the forward direction by a source moving in an equatorial orbit with radius slightly in excess of 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius of a highly collapsed central object are examined with special reference to quasistellar objects.
An improved radiation metric is obtained in which light rays make a small nonzero angle with the radius, thus representing a source of finite size. Kaufmann's previous solution is criticized. The stabilization of a scatterer near a source of gravitational field and radiation is slightly enhanced for sources of finite size.


The phenomenological, nonspeculative attitude of source theory is used in parallel developments of electromagnetism and gravitation, based on the analogous properties of the massless particles, photon and graviton, thus providing a methodological unification of these two areas of physics. The power and economy of the approach is illustrated by an application to perihelion precession.
Recent investigations of the initial-value problem of general relativity have shown that the initial-value constraints can be formulated in all cases as a system of elliptic equations with well-defined physical and mathematical properties. The solutions of these equations can be regarded as generalized gravitational potentials. These potentials are interrelated and depend on their sources quasilinearly. They are particularly useful in analyzing asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein's equations. We have found from these results (1) a technique for constructing physically meaningful initial data in the integration of Einstein's equations, and (2) a method for characterization and analysis of the spacelike mass, momentum, angular momemtum, and multipole moments of gravitational fields.
It is demonstrated that a stationary vacuum field solution with cylindrical symmetry is always reducible to a static cylindrically symmetric solution.
In the past ten years various computer systems have been developed able to perform algebraic calculations. Unfortunately, the fact that there are ready to use, mostly easily attainable, computer languages and programs for manipulation of non-numerical algebraic data is often overlooked by potential users. Several investigations in general relativity have been performed using such systems in the past few years, and in many cases the calculations were of such a length that it would have been prohibitive to complete them without help from a computer. In the first part of the paper we discuss the type of calculations that can be performed by algebraic systems, and several of these relativistic calculations are very briefly reviewed by way of example. In the second and main part of the paper we present a comparative review of most of the leading algebraic systems. To make the comparison more concrete we have taken two calculations from relativity and programed them, as closely as possible, in the same way for all these systems. It is not necessary for a future user who wants to do the same kind of calculations for other metrics to learn the complete syntax of one of these languages. He can make a slight modification to one of our programs, which we are prepared to distribute.
It is shown that during an isotropic gravitational collapse of a fluid with infinite electrical conductivity, the magnetic energy density cannot grow faster than<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em><sup>4/3</sup> no matter the equation of state, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϱ</em> is the total proper energy density. If the equation of state is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αθc</em><sup>2</sup>, where 0⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>⩽1, then the rate of growth of the magnetic energy density in such a collapse is proportional to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em><sup>4/3(1+α)</sup>. If an isotropic collapse is also locally adiabatic, it is shown, independently of any equation of state, that the rate of increase of the magnetic energy density is proportional to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>4/3</sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> is the proper material density. If the collapse is nonisotropic, shear can modify these results. Numerical estimates of the magnetic field strength at various stages in the collapse of a magnetic star are given.
The allowed asymptotic behavior of the Ricci tensor is determined for asymptotically flat space-times. With the aid of Penrose's conformai technique the asymptotic behavior of the components of the metric tensor, Weyl tensor, and spin coefficients in a suitable frame is calculated for such a space-time. For Einstein-Maxwell space-times these results reduce to those of Exton, Newman, Penrose, Unti, and Kozarzewski.
We prove a relativistic version of deRham's theorem and use it to find the holonomy group of a large class of space-times. We also show that the concept of “energy content” needed above completely determines<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> under suitable assumptions. Thus it brings us closer to a theorem that will express Mach's principle in general relativity.

Within the framework of Cartan's generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation one can achieve a unification of gravitational and weak interactions by appropriate choice of the parameter that couples spin and torsion. The proposed spin-torsion coupling has negligible cosmic effects except at stages of evolution when 10<sup>81</sup> nucleons are confined to a sphere with a radius of about one astronomical unit. For a single nuclear particle the gravitational effects of mass and spin balance at a radius of about 1% of its Compton wavelength, thus stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.
The emission of gravitational radiation by the recently discovered binary pulsar system will cause its orbital period<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> to decrease at a rate which can now be predicted to be<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sup>−1</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dP/dt</em>= −(3 ± 2) × 10<sup>−9</sup>yr<sup>−1</sup> if the only orbital perturbations are of general-relativistic origin. It is shown that other sources of period change are probably less important. The accuracy of this prediction as well as the possibility of its verification will improve greatly over the next few years. This is the first observation that can test general relativity beyond the post-Newtonian approximation.
Let<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> be a globally hyperbolic manifold. Among the many forms of completeness that may be imposed on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> are timelike Cauchy completeness and finite compactness. These two forms of completeness are shown to be equivalent for globally hyperbolic manifolds. They are also equivalent to the statement that every inextendible future-directed (past-directed) geodesic starting in the chronological future (past) of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> has points at arbitrarily large distance from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>.
This paper is concerned with space-times that satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in the presence of a perfect fluid, which may be charged. We consider the following question. Suppose that the space-time admits a group of motions (isometries), i.e., that the metric is invariant under a group of transformations. Does it follow that the quantities that describe the source, i.e., the electromagnetic field tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub>ij</sub>, the charge density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>, and the four-velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup>i</sup>, energy density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em>, and pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> of the fluid, are invariant under the group? It is found that the behavior of these quantities under the group is strongly restricted. In particular in the case of the three-dimensional special orthogonal group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3), which arises in the case of spherically symmetric space-times, it is found that the source quantities are invariant. On the other hand, it is established that there exist groups under which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub>ij</sub> is not necessarily invariant. The above question is also considered for the case of homothetic motions.
Dirac's revitalization of Weyl's gauge invariant geometry is examined. Weyl's geometry is characterized by the breaking of the symmetries of charge conjugation (C) and time reversal (T), but not CT. When an attempt is made to introduce a very simple form of symmetry breaking material into the theory, it is found that the geometric role formerly played by the electromagnetic field is suddenly taken over by a very short range massive vector field.
A first-order, ordinary differential equation is derived that can in principle be integrated for any assumed rotation law Ω = Ω(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) within a relativistic, perfect-fluid body. The solution of this equation reduces the number of unknown metric functions appearing in the line element for the spacetime of such differentially rotating bodies to three. In the case of rigid rotation this is equivalent to a result of Harrison.
We present a new method for performing multiple covariant differentiation of relative tensors in an ordinary affine manifold. The method is more straightforward than the standard method as it possesses a strong resemblance to the multiple differentiation of ordinary functions. The unusual feature of the method is the need to form the covariant derivative of nontensorial objects.
The mathematical meaning of the law of conservation of energy-momentum is examined. A distinction is made between the intrinsic properties of the metric tensor (i.e., those properties that are independent of the coordinate system), and the nonintrinsic properties of this tensor (i.e., those properties that depend upon the coordinate system). The covariance of the energy-momentum law is used to demonstrate that if one is given (a) any analytic contravariant energy-momentum tensor density in a given coordinate system<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> and (b) an analytic specification of the intrinsic properties of the metric tensor, no matter what these properties may be, one can always choose the nonintrinsic properties of the metric tensor in such manner as to satisfy the law of conservation of energy-momentum in the coordinate system<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> and thereby in every coordinate system. This result is proved only in the case where the contravariant components of the energy-momentum tensor density are given. Neither the covariant, nor the mixed energy-momentum tensor densities are considered. Other theorems similar to that described above are also derived. Many of the results obtained are nontrivial even when space-time is flat.
In this paper the external field of a bounded source emitting gravitational radiation has been considered. A successive approximation method has been used to integrate the Einstein equations in Bondi's coordinates. A method of separation of angular variables has been worked out and the approximate Einstein equations have been reduced to the key equations (3.8)–(3.10). The losses of mass, momentum, and angular momentum due to gravitational multipole radiation have been found. It has been demonstrated that in the case of proper treatment a real mass occurs instead of a mass aspect in a solution of the Einstein equations. In Appendix C Bondi's news function has been given in terms of sources.
It is shown that every conformally flat axisymmetric stationary space-time is necessarily static, and that if the source is a perfect fluid then the space-time metric is the usual Schwarzschild interior metric.
The theoretical measure of proper time on a moving particle in general relativity is the aggregate of infinitesimal clock readings in successive inertial frames along its space-time path. This raises the question of whether the proper time can be satisfactorily measured by a clock permanently located with the particle. An investigation is made of the likely effects of acceleration, or equivalently of a gravitational field, on atomic, nuclear, and particle “clocks.” The orders of magnitude of such effects are compared with those of other classical influences such as the Einstein redshift and transverse Doppler effects.
The existence problem of matter sources for given stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations is investigated. The existence of sources of a differentially or rigidly rotating perfect fluid can be proved at least in the neighborhood of boundary surfaces if these can be chosen suitably (theorem). In particular, there exist such “half-local” perfect fluid sources for the Kerr metric. Hence the existence of a global regular “Kerr-interior solution” cannot be excluded by local considerations in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a possible boundary.
The formulation of this limit given by Dautcourt [1] is slightly improved using the notions of Galilei manifold and Newtonian connection. It is then shown under what conditions the conservation equations ▽<sub>μ</sub><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μα</em> </sup> = 0 for an arbitrary relativistic continuum have the correct (also covariantly formulated) Newtonian limit. For electromagnetism one obtains a curved space generalization of the electric or magnetic Galileian theory of LeBellac and Lévy-Leblond [4] depending on whether the contravariant or the covariant Maxwell tensor is required to have a regular Galileian limit.
An approximate solution of Maxwell's equations for the rotating oblique magnetic dipole is given on the geometrical background of the Schwarzschild metric. The energy radiation is calculated for both the case of the Schwarzschild geometry and the linearized Kerr metric on the basis of the Newman-Penrose formalism. It is shown that general relativistic effects are not sufficient to explain by themselves the experimentally measured slowdown laws of realistic pulsars.
Using the Kerr metric the angular velocity of the locally nonrotating frame (LNRF) shell is shown to be equal to the value obtained by Thirring. It is established that perfect dragging as seen by a distant observer occurs when the red shift becomes infinite, while no such effect is observed in the LNRF.
In a previous article the Einstein-Maxwell field equations for non-null electromagnetic fields were studied under the conditions that the null tetrad is parallel-propagated along both principal null congruences. A solution with twist and shear, but no expansion, was found and was conjectured to be the only expansion-free solution. Here it is shown that this conjecture is false; the general expansion-free solution is found to be a family of space-times depending on a single constant parameter which is the ratio of the (constant) twists of the two principal null congruences.
An exact solution of Einstein's field equations of general relativity is given for a plane symmetric zero-rest-mass scalar field in the nonstatic case. The solution generalizes Singh's solution, which itself extends Taub's empty space-time.

In this paper a solution for the interior metric of a uniformly charged static fluid sphere has been obtained. The model sphere obtained has a physically reasonable equation of state. It is found that both the central density and the pressure become infinite when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>=2/5(1+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>). Here<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>0</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub>0</sub>: σ =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>0</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub>0</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sub>0</sub> are, respectively, the mass, radius, and charge of the sphere. In the limit<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>→0 the solution becomes identical to the Adler solution.
An example is given of a space-time which is timelike and spacelike complete but null incomplete. An example is also given of a space-time which is geodesically complete but contains an inextendible timelike curve of bounded acceleration and finite length. These two examples may be modified so that in each case they become globally hyperbolic and retain the stated properties. All of the examples are conformally equivalent to open subsets of the two-dimensional Minkowski space.
It is shown that the Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor vanishes for any Kerr-Schild metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>αβ</sub> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sub>αβ</sub> + 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hl</em><sub>α</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sub>β</sub> satisfying the condition<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>αβ</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>α</sup>=0. Some solutions verifying this condition are indicated.
Those generalized geometries satisfying the conditions that (a) parallel transfer with respect to the connection ▽ is path independent and (b) the geodesics of the metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> have the same trajectories as the autoparallels of the connection ▽, are determined. Some uniqueness theorems of the metric in terms of the curvature are shown for such generalized geometries. Geometries of this type may be useful for constructing geometrized theories of gravitation more general than Einstein's theory.
The field equations, in the new formulation of Einstein's unified field theory, are extended from the present vacuum form to the general case in which sources are present. In this generalization the contracted torsion tensor corresponds to the electromagnetic four-potential. By this correspondence, Einsteins<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em>-gauge transformation becomes identical to the ordinary electromagnetic gauge symmetry. The generalized Bianchi identities are found and used to discuss deviations from the Einstein-Lorentz equations of motion.
Particle creation in Friedman models of the open, closed, and quasi-Euclidean types is considered. The new method of calculation of probabilities of pair creation from vacuum by nonstationary external gravitational field is developed. This method is based on the diagonalization of the energy operator with the help of time-dependent canonical transformations. Finite numerical estimates for the densities of created particles and antiparticles are obtained both for early and modern stages of the evolution of the Universe.


A stationary axially symmetric perturbation of a rotating black hole due to a distribution of test matter is investigated. The Newman-Penrose spin coefficient formalism is used to derive a general set of equations describing the perturbed space-time. In a linear approximation we show that the mass and angular momentum of a rotating black hole is not affected by the perturbation. The metric perturbations near the horizon are given. We conclude that given a perturbing test fluid distribution, one can always find a corresponding metric perturbation such that the mass and angular momentum of the black hole are not changed. It was also noticed that when a → M, those perturbed spin coefficients and components of the Weyl tensor which determine the intrinsic properties of the incoming null cone near the horizon grow indefinitely.
Cosmological data are reviewed questioning whether the universe may be open and dominated by neutrinos and gravitons rather than by baryons. The thermal history of the Lepton Era is investigated incorporating the effects of neutral currents, additional neutrinos, and a small neutrino mass. In the canonical version of Big Bang cosmology (equal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos), the neutrino number and energy density is, like that of photons, gravitationally insignificant unless the neutrino has a small mass (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∼10</em> eV). The neutrino sea can be cosmologically significant if it is degenerate (so that the net leptonic or muonic charge is nonzero) with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∼7×10</em><sup>5</sup> neutrinos (or antineutrinos) per cm.<sup>3</sup> This density homogeneously spread out is still so low that even the most energetic cosmic ray protons will not be stopped, even if neutral currents exist with the usual weak strength. If these degenerate neutrinos have a small mass (∼0.5 eV), they will condense into degenerate neutrino superstars of the size and mass of galactic clusters. If neutral currents make the (ev) (ev) coupling five times greater than what it is in V — A theory, nucleosynthesis commences a little earlier than conventionally assumed. This increases the cosmological He<sup>4</sup> abundance predicted only slightly from Y= 0.27 to Y= 0.29. An appendix reviews the effect of neutral currents on neutrino processes in stars.
Braginsky and Mensky have described a novel gravitational wave detector based on a special “gravitational-electromagnetic resonance” in an annular waveguide. Their analysis is based on geometrical optics. If the configuration is analyzed as a perturbed boundary-value problem, however, no special resonance is evident. Nor does a more general cavity exhibit such a resonance. This paper concludes with a moral: When investigating the interaction of gravity and electromagnetism, one must be circumspect in applying the eikonal approximation.
This paper deals with space-times that satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in the presence of a perfect fluid, which may be charged. The electromagnetic field is assumed to be null. It is proved that if the space-time admits a group of isometrics then the fluid velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup>i</sup>, energy density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em>, pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>, and charge density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> are invariant under the group. In addition, if the charge density is nonzero, the electromagnetic field tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em><sub>ij</sub> is also invariant. On the other hand, examples of exact solutions are given which establish that if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> = 0, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub>ij</sub> is not necessarily invariant under the group. In the case of spherically symmetric space-times, however, in which the group of isometries acting is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em> (3),<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em><sub>ij</sub> is invariant, independently of whether or not<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> is nonzero. This result leads to the conclusion that in a spherically symmetric space-time the field equations in question admit no solutions with non-trivial null electromagnetic field.
It is shown that the set of timelike curves in a globally hyperbolic space-time manifold can be given the structure of a Hubert manifold under a suitable definition of “timelike.” The causal curves are the topological closure of this manifold. The Lorentzian energy (corresponding to Milnor's energy, except that the Lorentzian inner product is used) is shown to be a Morse function for the space of causal curves. A fixed end point index theorem is obtained in which a lower bound for the index of the Hessian of the Lorentzian energy is given in terms of the sum of the orders of the conjugate points between the end points.
The paper contains an investigation of Rosen's bimetric theory of gravitation in the case of slow velocities and weak fields. Newtonian and post-Newtonian approximations are obtained. The post-Newtonian equation of motion is integrated for an insular system of spherical bodies that move translationally at large mutual distances. It appears that the post-Newtonian law of motion obtained in this way contains terms that depend on the self-energy of the test body (a self-influence phenomenon). It is proved that also in the Einsteinian gravitation this influence is present, but it can be canceled out from the post-Newtonian law of motion if one takes into account the de Donder conditions. The self-influence discovered here seems to be a general gravitation phenomenon, which usually appears in theories of gravitation in the post-Newtonian approximation.
The sign of the gravitational energy radiated by a material system, as calculated by one or another appropriate stress-energy pseudotensor, is shown always to be positive. A fastmotion approximation that finds this quantity to be negative is shown to violate one of the conditions that ensure its positivity. As a consequence the calculation based on this approximation is shown to neglect terms of the same order (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sup>2</sup>) as it retains.
Robertson-Walker solutions are important in general relativity as universe solutions. This paper contains a number of Robertson-Walker-type solutions for certain cases, namely, for noncharged massless scalar meson fields, viscous fluids, Hookean elastic mediums, and Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic systems.
A class of approximate stationary solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations are obtained by expanding the metric in powers of a certain parameter and solving explicitly the first few orders in terms of four harmonic functions. These solutions, to the order considered, reduce to the Weyl, Bonnor, and Perjés-Israel-Wilson solutions, respectively, for suitable choice of the harmonic functions. They also contain a subclass that is asymptomatically flat and has realistic arbitrary spinning sources.
The inertial mass of a static spherically symmetric body is evaluated in the framework of Rosen's bimetric theory of gravitation. It is shown that the inertial mass equals the gravitational mass independently of the specific equation of state chosen, and hence that the theory satisfies the equivalence principle.
A representation of tensors and spinors at a point of space-time as spin and conformally weighted functions on the unit sphere is derived. Methods for performing algebraic operations on tensors and spinors in this representation are discussed.
Various invariant theories concerning algebraic properties of four-dimensional space-times have been developed in which the theory of the Debever-Penrose directions and that of Petrov's or Synge's classification belong to the same category. These two algebraic problems have been dealt with in a generalized metric recently considered by the author in studying the wave solutions.
Using Galilean time and retarded distance as coordinates the usual Kerr metric is expressed in form similar to the Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) metric. The combined Kerr-NUT metric is then investigated. In addition to the Kerr and NUT solutions of Einstein's equations, three other types of solutions are derived. These are (i) the radiating Kerr solution, (ii) the radiating NUT solution satisfying<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>ik</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>ξ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>ξ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub>, ξ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>ξ<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> = 0, and (iii) the associated Kerr solution satisfying<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>ik</sub>=0. Solution (i) is distinct from and simpler than the one reported earlier by two of us (P.C.V.; L.K.P) [6]. Solutions (ii) and (iii) give line elements which have the axis of symmetry as a singular line.
The problem of generally covariant extension of Lorentz invariant field equations, by means of covariant derivatives extracted from the nonsymmetric unified field, is considered. It is shown that the contracted curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of a covariant gauge derivative which contains the gauge derivative corresponding to minimal coupling, if the universal constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>, characterizing the nonsymmetric theory, is fixed in terms of Planck's constant and the elementary quantum of charge. By this choice the spinor representation of the linear connection becomes closely related to the spinor affinity used by Infeld and Van Der Waerden in their generally covariant formulation of Dirac's equation.
We consider trapped, null geodesies in an interior, rotating metric which matches the Kerr metric on a spheroidal surface. The interior metric is unphysical, but still useful for obtaining a qualitative understandng of the properties of the trapped, interior geodesies. We find, by numerical techniques, that the presence of rotation increases trapping for count-errotating orbits, but decreases it for corotating orbits.
On the basis of a Machian view of nature we find a covariant formulation of Newton's gravitational equation in a general frame which satisfies the requirements (i) of being singular if the density of mass is zero everywhere and (ii) of depending on the parallel transport of the four-momentum density of matter (from the three-space point in which it is defined to any other three-space point, at any fixed time) in such a way that it incorporates the idea that the frame has to be fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">directly</em> in connection with the distribution and motion of matter. In Paper II we will use such an equation as starting point in order to find relativistic gravitational equations which are supposed to hold in any conceivable universe, describe a purely geometrical theory of gravitation, and explicitly incorporate Mach's principle.
On the basis of the results of Paper I and guided by a Machian view of nature, we find new gravitational equations which are background dependent. Such equations describe a purely geometrical theory of gravitation, and their dependence on the background structure is through the total energy-momentum tensor on the past sheet of the light cone of each space-time point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> [θ<sup>μν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, say], i.e., through the integral on the past sheet of the light cone of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> of the parallel transport of the energy-momentum tensor from the space-time point in which it is defined to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> along the geodesic connecting the two space-time points. Following Gürsey, we assume that the source of the De Sitter metric is not the cosmological term, but, rather, the energy-momentum tensor of a “uniform distribution of mass scintillations” [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>μν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, say].<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>μν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, indeed, turns out to be equal to the metric tensor times a constant factor. As a consequence, in any local inhomogeneity A of a space-time whose background structure is determined by the Perfect Cosmological Principle,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em><sup>μν</sup> turns out to be approximately equal to the metric tensor times a constant factor, provided<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>αβ</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>αβ</sup> is sufficiently small and the structure of the past sheet of the light cones of the space-time points belonging to Λ is not too much perturbed by the local gravitational field. As a consequence, in Λ the new equations approximately reduce to Einstein's equations. If one considers a “superuniverse model” in which our universe is considered as a local inhomogeneity in a De Sitter background, then from the above result there follows a fortiori the agreement of the new gravitational equations with the classical tests of gravitation. Furthermore, the dependence on the background structure is such that the new equations (i) incorporate the idea that the frame has to be fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">directly</em> in connection with cosmological observations, and (ii) are singular in the absence of matter in the whole space-time. Moreover, (iii) the coupling constant turns out to be dimensionless in natural units (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>=1=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ</em>), and (iv) a local inertial frame in a De Sitter background is determined by the condition that with respect to it the background structure is homogeneous in space and in time and is Lorentz invariant.
An outline is presented for an approach to a two-body problem. The method uses null coordinates attached to one body and an expansion away from flat space. Unfortunately, the method fails to exhibit the Newtonian interaction between two particles. Therefore, no detailed calculations are given.

Following Bondi static, spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations with a core and an envelope have been considered. It has been shown that for any configurations with nonnegative pressure and density and with a surface red-shift<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub> ⩽ 4.77 arbitrarily large central red-shifts<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>c</sub> are possible in the limiting case of arbitrarily large radius. The effects of imposition of further constraints in the form of a real speed of sound not exceeding the speed of light are also examined. It is seen that for a given limiting sound-to-light-speed ratio √λ. (i) There exists a limiting surface red-shift<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>(λ) ⩽ 1.71. (ii) A configuration with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub> &gt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>(λ) is not possible, (iii) A configuration with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>(λ) has a unique and finite<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>c</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>c</sub>(λ). (iv) For<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>&lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em><sub>s</sub>(λ) arbitrarily large central red-shifts can be obtained for configurations with arbitrarily large radii.
On the basis of an approximation method developed in a previous paper the motion of an extended small mass on a gravitational background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {g_{\mu \nu } } \\ \end{array} = \eta _{\mu \nu } + \begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu \nu } } \\ \end{array} \)</span> is investigated. The mass is described by a spherically symmetric rest mass distribution with some form of “rigidity;” the smallness of the mass is defined by the assumption that the radius of the mass is small compared with the change of the background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu \nu } } \\ \end{array} \)</span>. The equation of motion is yielded by integrating Einstein's conservation law of energy and momentum over the world tube of the mass. In the lowest mixed order (mixed of the background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu \nu } } \\ \end{array} \)</span> and the retarded potentials of the mass in lowest order) this equation is identical with the geodesic line linearized in<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu \nu } } \\ \end{array} \)</span>. In the case when the motion on a static background generated by a localized matter distribution is finite, the gravitational radiation of the mass in lowest order is given.
In general, the gravitational two-body Hamiltonian, to order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−2</sup>, contains<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GP</em><sup>2</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> (<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">P · r</strong>)<sup>2</sup>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sup>2</sup> terms. We have previously shown [4–6] that a proper choice of coordinate system enables one to eliminate the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P · r</em>)<sup>2</sup> term. We now show that, making use of energy conservation, and coordinate transformations, we can eliminate either of the remaining two terms. In particular, we are able to write down a Hamiltonian and a Lagrangian that contain no mixed potential and kinetic terms.
In an earlier paper we considered a power-series expansion of the metric for a rotating field in terms of a parameter and constructed a solution of Einstein's equations to the first few orders in terms of two harmonic functions. We encountered a pair of Poisson-type equations which were apparently insoluble explicitly. The form of the metric considered was the Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou form. In this paper we consider a power-series expansion of the most general form of a rotating metric and show that one encounters the same two Poisson equations as before. If these equations are insoluble explicitly, as seems likely, then a general solution depending on two harmonic functions cannot exist in closed form.
In this review paper Einstein equations for axisymmetric vacuum fields are introduced in the form given by Lewis. Following Ernst they are reduced to one complex potential equation. Weyl-type, Schwarzschild, Kerr, Tomimatsu-Sato solutions, and their NUT-like generalizations are then discussed.

We construct stationary spherically symmetric solutions of the equations for accretion of large mass flows onto a black hole, including the interaction of matter and radiation due to Thomson scattering in diffusion approximation. We discuss the relevance of these solutions for a decision on the following question: Does the limitation of the luminosity (Eddington limit) also imply an upper bound to the possible rate of mass flow? The question remains open until all instabilities have been studied. At the moment we still tend to a negative answer.
In order to explore the actual astrophysical possibilities of the heterodyne gravitational wave detector we study its main limitation, due to the motion around the Earth and the Sun. This places an intrinsic limit to the time during which the detector stays tuned to the source and prevents us from taking full advantage of the very large quality factor of sources like pulsars. We study the ratio of signal to thermal noise and find, for a wave of given amplitude, that it is proportional to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em><sup>4/3</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sup>1/2</sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> is the frequency of the source and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> the mechanical quality factor. Consideration of possible astrophysical sources shows the difficulty of detection and points to the need for a tunable heterodyne system.
This is a continuation of a previous paper, in which the field equations in successive approximations and the post-Newtonian equations of motion in Rosen's theory of gravitation were derived. In this paper the energy integral and the center of mass for an insular system with an arbitrary structure are obtained in the post-Newtonian approximation. A many-body system is considered, and in the extreme case of point bodies (particles) the center-of-mass coordinates are found to be identical with the Einsteinian ones. The two-body problem is considered. For a system of two identical neutron stars of mass 1.3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>⊙</sub> (a possible model of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar system) the trajectory and the perihelion precession are calculated. It is found that the expressions obtained depend on the gravitational self-energy of the stars. The relations deduced from Rosen's bimetric gravitation in the case of small velocities and weak fields are compared with those of general relativity.
The ECSK and Yang-Mills theories are constructed with emphasis on their fiber bundle structure. In particular, the momentum tensor is derived as the Noether current of translational symmetry. The structure of the ECSK theory as a gauge theory of the Poincaré group is discussed. A theory of a Dirac field exhibiting internal affine symmetry, i.e., full internal Poincaré symmetry, is described. Aspects of the topological-geometric foundations of these theories are discussed, and some intuitive interpretations are presented.
It is possible to develop a new “projective relativity” based on the De Sitter universe with constant curvature. This theory extends the special theory of relativity on a cosmic scale, and it is akin to Milne's kinematic relativity.
The original construction of a photon clock by von Laue is noted. Several intrinsic difficulties inhibitory to the free use of such clocks are described.
It is shown that the field equations of the bimetric theory of gravitation have solutions corresponding to a class of homogeneous isotropic cosmological models with negative spatial curvature (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=−1). Some examples are given.
A twistor Hamiltonian formulation is given for describing the scattering of a massive particle with spin by a plane impulsive gravitational wave and of a massive particle with spin and charge by a plane impulsive electromagnetic wave. As a Taylor series in the spin of the particle, the expressions obtained agree with the Papapetrou equations and the magnetic dipole force law, respectively, to first order in the spin.
A new compact form of the dynamical equations of relativity is proposed. The new form clarifies the covariance of the equations under coordinate transformations of the space-time. On a deeper level, we obtain new insight into the infinite-dimensional symplectic geometry behind the dynamical equations, the decompositions of gravitational perturbations, and the space of gravitational degrees of freedom. Prospects for these results in studying fields coupled to gravity and the quantization of gravity are outlined.
This essay discusses the competition between neutrino radiation and gravitational radiation for the dominant method by which forming neutron stars radiate away their gravitational collapse energy. It is shown that neutrinos may, in fact, be the dominant mode; thus a failure to detect gravitation radiation from a supernova does not imply an error in general relativity but rather the existence of a more efficient radiation mechanism.
The general-relativistic equation of motion for a continuum and the corresponding mass balance equation are approximately treated for nonrelativistic velocities and weak gravitational fields, but taking into account the conductive momentum density caused by the irreversible effects. We find a new force term and a modification of the mass balance equation, neither of which can be neglected if irreversible processes are involved, (e.g., nuclear processes occurring in plasmas [1]).

We consider the equilibrium configurations for static spherically symmetric self-gravitating perfect fluids in general relativity. The fluid obeys an equation of state which is the extreme limit allowed by Hawking's strong energy condition. The new solutions we have found are generalized Einstein static universes which have a Killing horizon similar to the one we are familiar with from the vacuum Schwarzschild solution.
The electromagnetic field of a general stationary source, occurring in the vicinity of a rotating (Kerr) black hole, is obtained by solving the Maxwell and Teukolsky equations. The field is expressed both outside and inside the radius at which the source is located. As examples the fields of point charges, charged rings, current loops, and magnetic dipoles not necessarily located in axisymmetric positions are calculated. The electromagnetic field occurring when a Kerr black hole is placed in an originally uniform magnetic field is derived without assuming the alignment of the direction of the magnetic field and the axis of symmetry of the black hole.

Spherical stellar systems, from globular star dusters to compact galaxy clusters, appear to be dynamically relaxed. In galaxies and galaxy clusters, collisional relaxation acts too slowly to produce the observed result; and a new argument suggests that the same may be true of globular star clusters. “Violent relaxation” requires special initial conditions and seems unable to produce sufficiently extended halos. It is here proposed that dynamical relaxation may result from tidal perturbations by external systems. If this explanation is correct, it has important implications for the early history of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
It has been thought that mini-black-holes could only be formed in the very early stages of a big-bang universe. We show how they can be forming<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">today</em> in the cores of condensed, stellar-mass objects. The unique interactions of such “contemporary mini-black-holes” with their environment, their courses of evolution, and their astrophysical implications are then described briefly. These latter effects are critically dependent upon the existence of Hawking's “quantum evaporation” process for black holes. A rich and challenging new fieldmini—black-hole physics-is thereby introduced.
Although the 1-component O(3,1)<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em> </sup> of the full Lorentz group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3,1) has only one universal covering group, it is shown that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3, 1) has eight nonisomorphic simply connected covering groups. These are determined explicitly and their representation theory is given. There are arguments showing that the true symmetry group of relativistic particles is not<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3,1) but one or several of the 8 covering groups. This leads to a classification of particles into eight (possibly empty) classes. Particles belonging to different classes cannot make an interference. Two classes do not possess true finite dimensional irreducible representations. The existence of a spin structure in the sense of one of these covering groups will probably lead to limitations of the topology of space-time not yet investigated.
All nondiverging algebraically special ℋ -spaces are found by means of the complexified spin-coefficient formalism. The solutions are found to group naturally into two classes according to whether or not the optical-rotation spin coefficient<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\tilde \tau\)</span> vanishes.

The essay is concerned with that class of dynamical systems sufficiently isolated that the gravitational fields that they produce are asymptotically flat. It is argued that as far as the definitions of multipole moments and radiation fields are concerned, whether electromagnetic or gravitational, the original curved manifold is an unsuitable arena for their description. Instead, physical laws are to be formulated in space-times of image points. An example is the equality between the time rate of change of the gravitational quadrupole moment and the spin-2 Hertz potential.
The existing impressive tests for the strong equivalence principle are reviewed and their classical nature is emphasized. The possibility is raised here that intrinsic quantum spins may behave differently from orbital angular momentum in gravitational fields. The techniques developed to measure the electric dipole moment of the neutron are shown to offer hopes of testing this hypothesis. Einstein's theory predicts a null result for this experiment. This would constitute the first quantum test for the strong equivalence principle. Deviation from a null result would invalidate Einstein's theory of gravitation, as well as indicate the failure of the discrete symmetries (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P, T</em>) in gravitation.
We define curves on a Riemannian manifold as integrals of generalized Jacobi fields. We show that the force term that deviates the trajectory from the geodesic motion can be constructed as a functional of the metric tensor. These curves can be interpreted as particles (observers) coupled nonminimally with gravitation that can provide a class of residual observers for the inevitable singularity—as shown in the text.
The Yang-Mills approach to gravity is presented. This extension of general relativity is based on the structures of a gauge theory: the Lorentz frame bundle acts as gauge bundle, the connection on the Lorentz bundle is the basic dynamical field, and the Yang-Mills equations define the dynamics for the connection. As a consequence of these dynamics the equivalence principle will be broken on space-time regions of high curvature, while it remains strictly preserved for the solar system, for example, and for homogeneous and isotropic world models. They are explicitly used to illustrate the extension of the general relativistic dynamics.
A class of exact solutions of the cylindrically symmetric space-time with two degrees of freedom corresponding to the vacuum field equations of a scalar-tensor theory proposed by Dunn is obtained. The solutions possess wavelike character.
The improved version of the Einstein-Schrödinger equation of quantum gravity found by one of us is solved in the linear approximation. The solution differs from that obtained by K. Kuchař for the original version of the equation by an additional quantum effect: The energy, as deduced from measurements of the gravitational potential at infinity, has an error function probability distribution about its eigenvalue. The higher approximations are also considered and the appearance of a third quantum number, possibly related to the transition matrix, is deduced.
A brief, but precise and unified account is given of the results that have been rigorously established at the time of writing concerning the existence and nature of singularities in classical general relativity.
The Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations governing the local isometric embedding of Riemannian spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>n</sub> ⊂v<sub>n</sub> (N=n + P, P &gt; 0) are interrelated by the Bianchi identities in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>N</sub>. This leads to redundancies which permit great simplification in the embedding problem, i.e. allows a neglect of part of the equations. By transcription, to the case of semi-Riemannian spaces, of a result of R. Blum we obtain a number of theorems and corollaries expressing for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>n</sub> ⊂ V<sub>N</sub> this interdependency of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations. They form a generalization of previous results and are felt to be useful for the study of the geometrical properties of space-time and its three-dimensional space sections.
A necessary and sufficient condition for a plane symmetric space-time admitting a three-parameter group of motion to be of embedding class 1 is obtained in terms of the components of the curvature tensor.
Spherically symmetric dust clusters, of the type first proposed by Einstein, are generalized to nonstationaxy cases. Particular attention is paid to a massive spherical shell of particles orbiting a central body, using a method developed by Israel. Shells provide comparisons with Schwarzschild test particles, and offer as well a simplified approach to continuously distributed clusters.
The familiar wormhole model of geometrodynamics is extended to allow for knotted embeddings of the initial hypersurface. It is shown that topology change is not only a means to modify the connectivity of the space, but also the knot invariants of its embedding. In a probabilistic framework the process of “wormhole scattering” can be expressed by creation and annihilation operators acting on the wave function of quantum geometrodynamics. Implications concerning Wheeler's exciton model of elementary particles, the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>-gravity approach to hadronic matter, and interrelations with Jehle's flux quantization program are discussed.
Dixon's approach to describe the dynamics of extended bodies in metric theories of gravity is elaborated. The exact, general relation between the center-of-mass 4-velocity and the 4-momentum is derived. Quasirigid bodies are defined, and their equations of motion are shown to be determinate for a given metric. Multipole approximations are considered, and the physical meaning of quasirigidity is investigated by establishing an approximate connection with continuum mechanics.
Gravitational theories derived from an action principle where the Lagrange density is a power of the curvature scaler<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> are investigated. For all values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> the theories have the correct Newtonian limit and for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 1 the same weak field solution, which predicts a bending of light of three-quarters of the value predicted by general relativity (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=1).
Zero-rest-mass higher-spin fields in algebraically special vacuum background space-times are considered. It is shown that the algebraic speciality of the background metric strongly restricts the form of the solutions of these fields. These results are used to study perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole.
A metric topology<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H(¯M)</em> is introduced on the causal completion<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em> of a causally continuous space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. This metric topology is at least as coarse as the extended Alexandrov topology<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A(¯M)</em> on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em>. In both<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H(¯M)</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A(¯M)</em>, the original space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is an open and dense subset. From the definition of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H(¯M)</em>, it follows that the causality on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em> is continuous at boundary points. If<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> admits a compact Cauchy surface, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H(¯M)</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A(¯M)</em> are the same.
Existence and uniqueness are proved for certain initial-value problems for hyperbolic systems of second-order differential equations, each having the same principal part<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>δ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub>δ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sub>(where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>is indefinite). The initial data are given on two intersecting hypersurfaces H<sub>1</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> one of which-say<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>1</sub>-is a characteristic surface. The other surface,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub>, is permitted to be spacelike, timelike, or characteristic. For Einstein's vacuum field equations we restrict ourselves to an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> that is characteristic. Unlike the Cauchy problem, the data have to be necessarily of a considerably higher differentiability class (Sobolev class<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em><sup>2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>−1</sup>) than the solution (Sobolev class<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sup>). On the other hand, in the mixed problem (where one of the surfaces is spacelike) corner conditions have to be fulfilled. The occurrence of constraint equations for Einstein's metric field and for harmonic coordinates can be prevented by solving certain ordinary differential “propagation” equations.
It is shown how the normal conformal Cartan connection, used by Schmidt [1] to define conformal infinity of space-time, is related to the connection on the vector bundle of local twistors.
In this paper it is shown that in general relativity the theory of motion of quadrupole test particles (QTP's) can be used to describe the energy and angular momentum absorption by detectors of gravitational waves. By specifying the form of the quadrupole moment tensor Taub's [7] equations of motion of QTP's are simplified. In these equations the terms describing the change of the mass and of the angular momentum of a QTP due to external gravitational waves are found to occur. The limiting case of the flat space-time is also briefly discussed.
Conformal techniques are reviewed with respect to applications to the initial-value problem of general relativity. Invariant transverse traceless decompositions of tensors, one of its main tools, are related to representations of the group of “conformeomorphisms” acting on the space of all Riemannian metrics on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M.</em> Conformal vector fields, a kernel in the decomposition, are analyzed on compact manifolds with constant scalar curvature. The realization of arbitrary functions as scalar curvature of conformally equivalent metrics, a generalization of Yamabe's conjecture, is applied to the Hamiltonian constraint and to the issue of positive energy of gravitational fields. Various approaches to the solution of the initial-value equations produced by altering the scaling behavior of the second fundamental form are compared.
In this note we study M.F. Shirokov's “One New Effect of Einstein's theory of Gravitation” in the Kerr field. We confine ourselves to a circular trajectory (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=const) in the plane<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ=π</em>/2. In the limit that terms of the second order and higher in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a/r</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> is the angular momentum per unit mass) are negligible we find an additional shift between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub>θ</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> </sub> (or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub>φ</sub>) of amount −(8<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a/r)(m/r)</em> <sup>3/2</sup>. Thus<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> vibrations lie further behind<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>(or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>) vibrations in this case than in the Schwarzschild field.
The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(3) group of generalized duality rotations of the trace-free Ricci tensor which appear as gauge symmetries in a geometric theory of quantization are shown to be broken in a way resembling the breaking of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(3) group of the hadrons.
It is shown that in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-space of any Robinson-Trautman type II solution there is a uniquely defined world-line and that, under suitable regularity conditions, this world-line is a geodesic.
It is shown using a classical wave theory approach that photons and neutrinos have different propagation properties in curved space-time. It is also shown that neutrinos have the anomalous property that the sign of their energy density may change as they propagate, and they may even become ghost neutrinos in some regions.
We give exact interior solutions of the Einstein-Cartan equations describing charged perfect fluid distribution in general relativity. Results previously unknown for the uncharged case are deduced and we find that the pressure is discontinuous at the boundary of the fluid sphere.
The manner in which a field of gravitational radiation modifies the cosmological background space-time of the model universe containing it is considered. The cosmological equations for the models are solved and a number of examples of the resulting universes are presented in diagrammatic and tabular form.
It is shown that under certain assumptions the Einstein-Cartan field equations are not unique but may reasonably be modified to a degree. These modified Einstein-Cartan equations are proven to be unique under quite general conditions and are likely the most general equations in any metric-torsion gravitational theory whose field equations are derivable from a variational principle and such that their geometric part is independent of constants other than the speed of light and the gravitational constant.
A quasirecurrent pairing of vector fields {X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>} (defined in [1]) is investigated on a space-time in two cases: (1)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sub>1</sub> is spacelike and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sub>2</sub> is timelike; (2) X<sub>1</sub> is null and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sub>2</sub> space-like. The physical interpretation of these vector fields is given.
The Weyl solution of the problem, obtained on the assumption that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>00</sub> is a function of the electrostatic potential, is varied and the linearized field equations for the variation are discussed. The complete solution of the problem is determined for the special case of the Weyl solution that generalizes the Reissner-Nordstrom solution with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> = ¦e¦.
Starting from the Reissner-Nordström solution with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> we consider a variation representing a second particle situated outside the horizon. A formal dipole term in the potential of the second particle ensures equilibrium without additional stresses between the particles. The complete solution for the variation is determined and discussed in detail.
We show how to introduce the “Noether Operator” of a (possibly constrained) variational principle even when the Lagrangian contains spinor fields (and their derivatives to any finite order). After relating that operator to the so-called “canonical” and “symmetric” stress-energy tensors, we construct explicitly the divergence by which these differ. A brief appendix illustrates the method of dealing with spinors by calculating T<sup>μv</sup> for the Dirac equation.
An exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Yukawa field equations has been obtained in a space-time with a static metric. A critical analysis reveals that the results previously obtained by Patel [9], Singh [10], and Taub [11] are particular cases of our solution. The singular behavior of the solutions has also been discussed in this paper. Further, extending the technique developed by Janis et al. [12], for static fields, to the case of nonstatic fields, an exact time-dependent axially symmetric solution of EMY fields has been obtained. Our solution in the nonstatic case is nonsingular in the sense of Bonnor [15] and presents a generalization of the results obtained by Misra [7] to the case when a zero-mass scalar field coexists with a source free electromagnetic field.
We derive the tensor-virial theorem and the angular momentum integral for a system of bodies of finite dimensions in the post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity. For this purpose we first examine the Newtonian case. Then we prove that, if tidal interactions between the bodies are neglected, it is possible in the post-Newtonian approximation and for each body of the system to define a conserved mass and a corresponding center of mass, to provide expressions for the vanishing of the post-Newtonian self-linear momentum, self-force and self-torque, and also to write down an appropriate tensor-virial equation. This, in turn, enables us to write down the tensor-virial theorem and the angular momentum integral for the many-body system, which, when expressed in terms of the above masses and centers of masses, reduce to the corresponding expressions valid for a system of point masses, in the limiting case when the dimensions of the bodies tend to zero.
Using the results of the preceding paper we evaluate in the post-Newtonian approximation the energy integral for a system of extended bodies with arbitrary internal structure and internal motions.
The role of convention in various definitions of clock synchronization and simultaneity is investigated. We show that two principal methods of synchronization can be considered: system internal and system external synchronization. Synchronization by the Einstein procedure and by slow clock transport turn out to be equivalent if and only if the time dilatation factor is given by the Einstein result (1−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>. An ether theory is constructed that maintains absolute simultaneity and is kinematically equivalent to special relativity.
First-order tests of special relativity are based on a comparison of clocks synchronized with the help of slow clock transport with those synchronized by the Einstein procedure. This comparison enables the measurement of the one-way velocity of light and is equivalent to a measurement of the time dilatation factor. The accuracy of present measurements is of the order 10<sup>−7</sup>, yielding an upper limit of 3 cm/sec for the ether drift.
Some compact spaces of achronal hypersurfaces are constructed in various types of space-time. A variational principle is introduced on these spaces, smooth extremals of which are spacelike hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature. The integrand of the variational principle is shown to be upper semicontinuous and the direct methods of the calculus of variations are applied to obtain a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>0</sup> extremal, which is defined to be a spacelike hypersurface of generalized constant mean curvature. The family of such hypersurfaces generated by altering the value of the mean curvature is discussed and the mean curvature itself is shown to have many of the properties of a canonical time coordinate.



Szekeres obtained some exact solutions of Einstein's equations for dust which have applications in cosmology, in the theory of collapse, and in the study of gravitational radiation. It is shown that in their most general form these space-times have no Killing vectors.

The absence of stationary source-free solutions and the positive energy problem in general relativity are discussed, at the linearized level, in terms of the Bel-Robinson tensor. The possibility is raised that there may exist stationary solutions to the full Einstein equations in five dimensions.
We develop a method for defining and performing path integrals in phase space. This work generalizes to phase space the method formulated in recent years for path integration in configuration space. We give the relationship between the Wiener measure and the Liouville measure.
A mass skeleton is defined for a static extended body in a gravitational field. It is a scalar-valued distribution on a tangent space, and is equivalent to that part of the reduced multipole moment structure which describes the mass density of the body. An explicit form is given for this distribution in terms of the mass density and the scalar potential of the field. It is deduced that the mass skeleton and the scalar potential are not completely independent. The smoothness of the mass distribution imposes certain weak restrictions on those scalar potentials which are compatible with a given mass skeleton.
The introduction of a scalar potential with a more general schema than general Relativity eliminates the “event horizon.” Among possible solutions, the Schwarzschild one represents a singular case. A study of the geodesic properties of the matching with an approximated interior Solution are given. A new definition of the gravitational mass and χ function is deduced.
We write the Dirac and Einstein equations and the spinor Lagrangian in tetrads suited to the “1+3” formalism of general relativity.
In the bimetric theory of gravitation, the static spherically symmetric case involving matter characterized by density and pressure is considered. It is found that the condition that the mass be stationary under small variations of the field variables (including the density) for a fixed number of baryons leads to the field equations and to the equilibrium condition. If one considers only solutions of the field equations, then the mass for a fixed baryon number is stationary (one can expect it to be extremal in most cases) if the equilibrium condition holds.
A gravitational law is proposed on a De Sitter covariant space. Dirac's De Sitter covariant spinning electron equation is generalized to the presence of gravitational fields. The resulting equation differs from the generally covariant Dirac equation by a mass renormalization. The last result is a generalization of that of Gürsey and Lee [2] in case of the homogenous De Sitter metric, and it gives a wider outlook on the significance of this result from the point of view of gauge theory.
Weyl and Eddington suggested three alternative general relativistic theories of gravitation with fourth-order field equations which in empty space admit the Schwarzschild metric as a solution. These theories, Like Einstein's, follow from a variational principle and thus imply differential identities. If, as in Einstein's theory, the sources are taken to be proportional to the energy-momentum tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>μν</sup>, these identities imply the vanishing of the covariant divergence of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>μv</sup>. It is shown here that in the presence of extended sources, Weyl's and Eddington's theories (as well as all other higher-order metric theories derivable from an action principle) contradict Newton's law of gravitation in the nonrelativistic limit. To entail this law would require a modification of the source term of the field equations which in general is not compatible with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sup><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">;v</em> </sub> alternatively, one could require only asymptotic agreement with Newton's law, which is compatible with supplementary higher-order terms in Einstein's equations, but which requires the introduction of universal constants of the dimensions of length. None of the generalizations of Einstein's equations considered here admits Birkhoff's theorem.

The field equations for axially symmetric generalizations of the 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole are written out in a preferred coordinate system. It is argued that no soliton solutions exist when the product 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">eg</em> of the electric charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> with the magnetic charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> is an even integer.
The local supercluster of galaxies (LSG) is considered as an expanding region inside a vacuole which is itself embedded in a Friedmann model. It is shown that de Vaucouleurs' data for the LSG can be accounted for by this inhomogeneous cosmological model. On the contrary, the interpretation of these observations would meet some difficulty with a theory of tired light.

We show how, for a wide class of asymptotically flat space-times, it is possible to solve the equation for asymptotically shear-free complex null cones (the good-cut equation) to first approximation, and thereby obtain first-order ℋ spaces and associated firstorder asymptotic projective twistor spaces.
A generalization of the Schwarzschild space-time, a Petrov type-II electrovacuum solution, is obtained. The metric is stationary but the Maxwell tensor contains an arbitrary function of time. The curvature invariants and singularities are investigated using<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) spin coefficient techniques.
A simple proof of the generalization of the theorem of Israel concerning the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild black hole is presented.
Certain gravitational systems are described for which particular equations of state are singled out by means of purely mathematical considerations. The fact that these equations of state are realistic, and indeed the most relevant to the physical systems under study, suggests that locked into Einstein's field equations lies some information about local physical conditions, and that in order to describe gravitating systems, it is not always necessary to draw on extraneous branches of physics.
Using Penney's balanced field equations it is shown that the electron may be considered as a material ball having charge on its surface. The electromagnetic field energy still turns out to be 3/4 of its total mass. The density of the material ball is found to be half of the square density of charge.
It is shown that the general form of the Robertson-Walker cosmological metric admits symmetry properties that are members of the symmetry family of contracted Ricci collineations. A particular form for the conservation law generator given by ▽<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sub>[(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>)<sup>1/2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup> </span>−1/2δ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">jT</em> </sup> </span>)η<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>] = 0 following in consequence of these symmetries is obtained and interpreted.
We find in this paper a special class of spatially homogeneous solutions of the Einstein-Lichnerowicz equations, describing the gravitational field of an electrically charged fluid with infinite conductivity.
In a recent paper [1] methods were developed for studying the problem of matching matter and vacuum solutions of Einstein's field equations along timelike hypersurfaces in the axisymmetric stationary case. Criteria for the existence and uniqeness of perfect fluid sources for given vacuum fields were given in the form of a theorem. As an application, the existence of such Kerr-interior solutions could be proved at least in a full neighborhood of suitably chosen boundary surfaces.</p><p class="Para">In this paper further investigations of this “matching problem” are made for some special cases. It is found that stationary rotating dust cannot be a source of the Kerr metric and the existence of “rotating Schwarzschild sources” is proved. These results are discussed together with further aspects of the general methods used.
The equations governing geometrical objects in ℋ space are written in terms of operators adapted to families of left shear-free<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em><sup>0</sup>= 0) cross sections of complexified null infinity (<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">C I</span><sup>+</sup>). The concept of ℋ-conformai weight (HCW) is introduced, and a derivative operator<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">I</span><span class="Stack"> <sub>a</sub> <sup>′</sup> </span>, which is closely connected with the covariant derivative but which (unlike the covariant derivative) maps objects having well-defined HCW to other such objects, is defined. A function ℐ, derived from the Gaussian curvature of left shear-free slicings of<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">C I</span><sup>+</sup> and having a well-defined HCW, is shown to contain all the curvature information for ℋ space.
On the grounds of the two correspondence limits, the Newtonian limit and the special theory limit of Einstein field equations, a modification of the cosmical constant has been proposed which gives realistic results in the case of a homogeneous universe. Also, according to this modification an explanation for the negative pressure in the steady-state model of the universe has been given.

A classification scheme is given for the known exact solutions of Petrov type D of the Einstein field equations with perfect-fluid source. The scheme is based on the kinematic properties of the fluid and on the geometric properties of the principal null congruences of the Weyl tensor.
Various second-order optical tests of special relativity are discussed within the framework of the test theory developed previously. Owing to the low accuracy of the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, the Lorentz contraction is known by direct experiments only to an accuracy of a few percent. To improve this-accuracy several experiments are suggested.
Any continuous time function on a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sup> space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> (i.e., a scalar on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> that increases along any causal curve) can be approximated by smooth<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sup> time functions. A time function defined on a (bounded) subset of a stably causal<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> can be extended to a time function on the whole of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>.
Adding the cosmological term Λ, which is assumed to be variable in this paper, to the Brans-Dicke Lagrangian, we try to understand the meaning of the term and to relate it to the mass of the universe. We also touch upon the Dirac large-number hypothesis, applying the results obtained from the application of our theory to a uniform cosmological model.
Previous results of two of us (J. P. and I. R.) concerning left-degenerate Einstein-flat complex space-times, and preliminary results concerning the electromagnetic field [1], are here generalized and worked out in some detail for the system of Einstein-Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant. On the assumption that there exists a congruence of totally null surfaces, the system is reduced to a pair of equations for two unknown functions.
The members of one explicit class of functions in ℂ<sup>2</sup> are identified with the geodetic shear-free null congruences in Minkowski's space-time. Members of a second explicit class are identified with the type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> vacuum space-times with twist-free rays. These two classes are special subclasses from a larger class of functions associated with the type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> space-times. This larger class is characterized in the following way: If<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ζ</em> are holomorphic variables in ℂ<sup>2</sup>, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ, ζ</em>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\bar \zeta \)</span>), a function holomorphic in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em>, belongs to the class provided the function<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\partial _{\zeta } \partial _{\zeta } \)</span>∂<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em>/∂<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> satisfies the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equation for an antiholomorphic function on the 3-surface where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ, ζ</em>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\bar \zeta \)</span>) has real values.
If we study the de Sitter universe with the methods of projective geometry, we obtain a new mechanics valid on a cosmic scale and for hyperdense matter. In this projective mechanics the mass varies with the space-time distance, and the linear and angular momentum are reunited in a single projective tensor.
Two relativistic analogs of Ferraro's law of isorotation for a fluid with infinite electrical conductivity are given. In the first case it is assumed that the flow is shear-free with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>=0 and it is shown that £<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(H) ω</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>=0. In the second case it is assumed that there exists a space-like Killing vector field parallel to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub>, and it is proved that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>,<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>=0.
A relativistic red-shift effect is found that is distinct from the doppler and gravitational red shifts and provides a mechanism for producing large local red shifts without raising kinetic energy problems. This effect produces red shifts in discrete amounts—a situation for which there may be some evidence in quasar observations.
An alternative method of identifying base-space and fiber tensors is presented and is used to describe interacting Dirac and Yang-Mills fields with “internal affine symmetry.” In a separate construction, the cosmological constant is derived from the fiber bundle structure of a generalized theory of Poincaré gauge symmetry. Mathematical foundations of the computations are discussed.
This paper treats matter field space-times admitting timelike conformai motions and timelike members of the family of contracted Ricci collineations (FCRC). The physical properties of these timelike symmetries in relation to the time development of relativistic matter field space-times are developed in terms of a number of specific theorems. Insofar as possible, the similarities and differences of the timelike conformal motions and the FCRC are discussed in some detail. Special applications are given that illustrate the possible value of the present considerations and related conservation expressions in relation to the Cauchy problem of matter field space-times admitting timelike symmetry properties.
A classification scheme for boundary points of incomplete space-times is described. For all classes explicit examples are presented to illustrate the different behaviour of the geometry near those boundary points.

Rosen's bimetric theory is analyzed anew and is shown to have deficiencies if the space is assumed to be Riemannian. The problems are due mainly to the introduction of the flat metric γ<sup>μυ</sup>, and the identification of the stress-energy tensor,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>μυ</sup>. It is indicated that if the Riemannian interpretation could be avoided the theory still holds promise as a viable theory of gravitation.
For static, spherically symmetric stellar models it is shown that imposing the condition that the determinant of the metrical coefficients takes on its flat space-time value everywhere is sufficient to ensure that the coordinates are admissible in the sense of Lichnerowicz. The general method of solution is illustrated by integrating the equations for a star of constant, uniform density.
A definition for the energy-momentum tensor ℑ of a finite body is given; this utilizes Synge's parallel propagator and an invariant spatial volume element. From ℑ the massenergy invariant of the body,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span>, is obtained. A new interpretation of the constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> in Schwarzschild's exterior solution is given.
The curvature tensor of space-time can be described most concisely by giving the components of the Weyl and Ricci tensors relative to a complex null tetrad. The Newman-Penrose equations provide a simple and direct algorithm for calculating these components. This paper describes a computer program, written in the symbolic manipulation language CAMAL, which performs this calculation. Comparisons are made with the classical tensorial method of calculation, and some applications are discussed.


An explicit example of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to gravitational interaction is given. It is shown that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved space-times, the “dragging of inertial frame” effects lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ultrarelativistic regime. This situation is compared with those that arise in other interactions. It is pointed out that spinning-up of relativistic configurations is analogous to cooling-down of systems in solid state physics-especially in magnetism-and in high-energy physics. This analogy may turn out to be significant in the investigation of thermodynamical properties of the gravitational field.
In this note the general monad method is systematically represented, and it is shown how it may be reduced to its two basic special gauges. The last section deals with two kinds of canonical formalism, “coordinate” and “referential” ones, based on the kinemetric gauge.
The present paper and a companion work are intended as one possible realization of a non-customary gauge theory of general relativity-as set forth in only broad outline in an earlier work. In this first paper, it is found that both radar echo delay and the perihelion shift differ slightly from their customary expressions. Unfortunately, it is also found that the usual statement of the principle of equivalence does not hold in the present formulation. Finally, in the second paper, a single cosmological model is investigated that appears to be promising.
A noncustomary gauge theory of general relativity, developed in detail in the preceding paper (II), is here applied to cosmology. A universe that is homogeneous and isotropic in the customary gauge, is considered-first generally, and then in more detail for the case where the noncustomary universe is matter dominated and static. With a particular choice of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em> equation, this model is solved and a new relation between customary mass density, Hubble constant, and deceleration parameter is found. For a customary deceleration parameter of 1.98, this relation yields a customary mass density of 3.1×10<sup>−31</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>-in good agreement with experiment. Finally, the age of the universe in this model is found to be&gt;6.6× 10<sup>9</sup> yr, again in agreement with other estimates.
Dirac has recently introduced a new theory of gravity which includes his large numbers hypothesis. The exact one-body vacuum solution consistent with multiplicative matter creation is obtained and discussed.
It is shown that most, if not all, previously known solutions of the gravitational field equations with a zero-mass scalar source<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em> can be found “without solving the field equations” by applying known theorems. Penney's recent solution, characterized in part by having a conformally flat metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sub>2</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em></sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em><sub>ij</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>i</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>j</sup> is shown to be insufficiently general when his vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em><sub>i</sub> is null. The problem is reformulated and new solutions of the conformally flat type are found. These are, in general, such that ø and σ are no longer linearly related.
We consider bremsstrahlung encounters between a test body of mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>, and a large fixed mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> with charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>. We use the method of virtual quanta, and calculate the total electromagnetic and gravitational energy radiated in such encounters. We consider both the case in which the deflection is principally electromagnetic in nature, and the case in which the deflection is principally gravitational. The results are interpreted by considering the predictions of the equivalence principle, for the behavior of the test particle,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">and for the behavior of the virtual quanta</em>. As expected from the equivalence principle, the total radiation produced is larger for electromagnetic deflection than for a gravitational deflection through the same angle.
It is shown that spherically symmetric static general relativistic cosmological space-times can reproduce the same cosmological observations as the currently favored Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes, if the usual assumptions are made about the local physical laws determining the behavior of matter, provided that the universe is inhomogeneous and our galaxy is situated close to one of its centers. Only (i) unverifiable a priori assumptions, (ii) detailed physical and astrophysical arguments, or (iii) observation of the time variation of cosmological quantities can lead us to conclude that the universe we live in is not such a static space-time.
When spontaneous particle creation occurs in a strong gravitational field, it seems clear on physical grounds that the particle creation must “back-react” on the gravitation field. It is generally believed that in the semiclassical approximation this effect can be described by assigning an effective stress energy to the created particles, which acts as a source of the gravitational field via Einstein's equation. In this essay, I discuss an axiomatic approach for determining the renormalized value of this effective stress energy.
It is demonstrated that (1) there exist infinite<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>1</sub> that satisfy Lichnerowicz's conditions (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> conditions) in a globally hyperbolic manifold; and, (2) there is no<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>1</sub> in an expanding universe that would satisfy those conditions and that would behave as the ordinary Δ<sub>1</sub> of flat space when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x → x′.</em> The author thinks that these results present a serious problem for finding a semiclassical theory of scalar field in curved space-time.
Gravitational radiation is considered within the first-order approximation. A pattern of an electromagnetic cavity is studied: Gravitational waves give rise to a deformation of the planes limiting the cavity. This deformation alters the electromagnetic radiation. Several cases are studied and orders of magnitude are put forward.
Gravitational radiation is considered within the first-order approximation. A classical gravitational background yields transitions between quantum electromagnetic states in a cavity. Orders of magnitude are picked out from special patterns. The interest of second-order effects is emphasized and experimental possibilities are sketched.
The existence of nontrivial causality violation is a peculiar property of the space-time around a naked singularity. In the case of Kerr metric with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a &gt; m</em> we have found that for a particular class of geodesies that could in principle violate causality, the conditions for causality violation are never satisfied.
Since Rosen's bimetric theory of gravity provides at present a worthy devil's advocate for the black hole hypothesis, it is important for eventual observational work to elaborate the astrophysical consequences and possibilities peculiar to it. We begin to do this by deriving the orbital topography of the spherically symmetric solution to Rosen's field equations-which is relevant to the behavior of relativistic axisymmetric accretion flows-and calculating predicted accretion disk efficiencies, which can be as much as 2.5 times higher than for a disk in Schwarzschild. Thereafter, a brief treatment of the shortest kinematic time scale and the time dilations for in-falling material is given. Finally we show that Birkhoff's theorem does not hold in Rosen's theory, and, therefore, that genuine gravitational monopole radiation is possible. The energy it carries, however, is not positive definite.
A space-time filled with the self-gravitating charged fluid with constant electric permitivity and constant magnetic permeability is investigated. On expressing the stress-energy tensor in terms of an orthonormal tetrad, the equations of motion and Maxwell equations are formulated. In case of the geodesic flow, the conditions for divergence-free electric and magnetic fields are obtained. It is shown that the space-time permeated by the charged fluid with the electric field orthogonal to the magnetic one is embedded in 5-dimensional flat class-one space-time if and only if the electromagnetic energy flux vector vanishes.
The action of quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field may be regarded as the origin of the dissipative processes associated with Hawking radiation. In this picture the black hole possesses internal coherence by virtue of the localization of its mass. The cumulative effect of the quantum fluctuations in the geometry is that this coherence is corrupted and the mass is sapped away.
A model for QSOs and the nuclei of Seyfert Galaxies is proposed in which mass lost from stars in a galactic nucleus repeatedly builds to a critical density and then collapses to the center where it accretes onto a massive black hole (≈10<sup>8</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>⊙</sub>), emitting great luminosity. This model describes a means of starting with an ordinary nucleus and developing conditions found in QSOs. By invoking intermittent flashes we overcome a difficulty previously encountered in similar models in which plausible sources of mass in reasonable galactic nuclei fail by a factor of ≈10<sup>−2</sup> in fueling a black hole at QSO luminosities.
Various techniques are reviewed for identifying the coordinates employed in a given line element. In particular the questions of coordinate range, signature, character of coordinates, isometries, and linearization are considered. The consideration of isometries leads to the introduction of functional form-invariant (FFI) transformations, which may in particular be of help in obtaining Killing solutions. Finally the general question of coordinate identification is discussed.
A four-parameter family of vacuum solutions of Petrov type {3, 1} possessing nonvanishing twist, which was obtained separately by A. Held and I. Robinson, is investigated. Various techniques that were reviewed in an earlier paper are employed for interpreting the coordinates. In addition, the functionally form invariant solutions of a functionally related metric are obtained, thereby enabling the Killing structure of the family to be fully analyzed.
The electrostatic potential in a gravitational field is estimated up to the order of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sup>2</sup> in the framework of the conventional quantum field theory. It is shown that the electrostatic potential is different from the classical one. We find that this discrepancy is attributable to the process in which a particle emits three massless ones which are absorbed by three other particles.
The quantum mechanically described electron in an external electromagnetic field, both embedded in an expanding universe with shear, is discussed. This is important for the fundamental question if a quantum mechanically treated atomic clock in curved space-time (based on a hydrogen atom) shows proper or gravitational time. Furthermore, contradictory results reported by other authors seem to imply that quantum mechanics cannot be reconciled with curved space-time. It is shown that this is not the case for expanding Robertson-Walker universes. As basis, in this paper a Hilbert space formulation of the problem with special regard to the Hamiltonian is given. The respective influence of the cosmic expansion and the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the cosmic hypersurfaces on bound quantum mechanical systems is treated in general. For the special case of an expanding 3-flat (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>=0) Robertson-Walker universe it is shown that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom agree completely with the one in 4-flat space-time, so that in this case the hydrogen atom can be taken as atomic clock showing proper time.
We discuss a method of studying the stability of solutions of Einstein's equations, which can be outlined as follows: Consider an embedding of a given Einstein space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>4</sub> into a pseudo-Euclidean space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p,q</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sup> </span> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> &gt; 4,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p + q</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>) (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p,q</em>) describing the signature of the space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p,q</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sup> </span>. Then all the geometrical objects of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>4</sub> can be expressed in terms of the embedding functions,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>),<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> = 1, 2,...,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N, i</em> = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then let us deform the embedding:<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>→<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ευ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>, ε being an infinitesimal parameter. The Einstein equations can be developed then in the powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>; we study the equations arising by requirement of the vanishing of the first- or second-order terms. Some partial results concerning the de Sitter, Einstein, and Minkowskian spaces are given.
In general relativity a general static solution describing spherically symmetric distributions of scalar and electrically charged dust is obtained and applied to the construction of a singularity-free extended particle model.
General properties of solutions (<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g, F</strong>) of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations are discussed, where<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g</strong> is a metric tensor and<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">F</strong> is a non-null Maxwell field. In particular the case is discussed where<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g</strong> admits a Killing vector field<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">v</strong> with special emphasis on the case where<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">v</strong> is not admitted by<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">F</strong>, i.e., the electromagnetic field does not have a symmetry of the metric tensor. An example is given of a solution (<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g, F</strong>) in which<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g</strong> admits a hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector not admitted by<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">F</strong>.
The balanced field equations due to Penney are used to find solutions for cosmological models in the presence of charge. Herein, it is found that the introduction of charge adds additional terms to the Einstein conservation equation and distribution expressions. The curvature parameter is affected and it is concluded that whereas matter affects it positively, the charge does so negatively. There then arises also the possibility of an evolution of local systems against the background of a global expansion.
In the first part of this paper we describe a formalism capable of finding all homogeneous solutions of Einstein's field equations with any arbitrary energy-impulse tensor. In the second part we find all homogeneous vacuum solutions.
The dynamics of the “standard hot big-bang model” of the universe according to general relativity with modified cosmical constant are discussed.
In the bimetric theory of gravitation the background metric tensor γ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>, previously taken as describing flat space-time, is now chosen on the basis of a model of the universe. In accordance with the perfect cosmological principle, it is taken as describing a space-time of constant curvature. There are three possible forms, corresponding to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0, 1, −1. Only for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=1 (a closed universe) does the model not go through a singular state; hence this is the appropriate choice. The isotropic solution of the field equations can be chosen to agree with the present cosmological observations. For small systems like the solar system the theory gives the same results as before, in agreement with those of general relativity.
Inclusion of the four-derivative terms ∫<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sup>(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>)<sup>1/2</sup> and ∫<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup>(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>)<sup>1/2</sup> into the gravitational action gives a class of effectively multimass models of gravity. In addition to the usual massless excitations of the field, there are now, for general amounts of the two new terms, massive spin-two and massive scalar excitations, with a total of eight degrees of freedom. The massive spin-two part of the field has negative energy. Specific ratios of the two new terms give models with either the massive tensor or the massive scalar missing, with correspondingly fewer degrees of freedom. The static, linearized solutions of the field equations are combinations of Newtonian and Yukawa potentials. Owing to the Yukawa form of the corrections, observational evidence sets only very weak restrictions on the new masses. The acceptable static metric solutions in the full nonlinear theory are regular at the origin. The dynamical content of the linearized field is analyzed by reducing the fourth-order field equations to separated second-order equations, related by coupling to external sources in a fixed ratio. This analysis is carried out into the various helicity components using the transverse-traceless decomposition of the metric.
A new approach to the problem of the motion of a self-interacting massive charged particle in general relativity is presented. A charged Robinson-Trautman (RT) solution is used as a general relativity model for such a particle. Such a solution is shown to generate a unique world-line in its own<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-space. This is argued to be the asymptotically observed world-line of the particle. Using the RT dynamical relations, the equation of motion is derived, and, in the limiting case of zero curvature, it is shown to be the same as the classical Lorentz-Dirac equation of motion.
Some proposed models for a quantum field theory in general relativity are briefly analyzed. Their main difficulties are a consequence of the initial choice of the group of symmetries of the (quantum) field equations. The necessity of selecting space-time isometries in a general covariant theory and the unphysical character of the Poincaré translations in a tangent plane theory are discussed. Starting from some basic requirements, a model is proposed in which the groups of symmetries are derived from the proper homogeneous groups of isometries of the minimal isometric local embedding spaces of space-times.
Algebraic constraints are derived for higher-spin fields in a curved space-time manifold. Comparison is made with previously obtained results. A particular solution of the zero-restmass field equations is given for the plane wave Einstein-Maxwell space-times.
It is proved that every line element of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup>=−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>2</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dy</em><sup>2</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>(x)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dz</em><sup>2</sup>-2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>(x)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dzdt</em>, which satisfies Einstein equations for a perfect fluid, is necessarily isometric to the Gödel's universe.
The characteristic initial-value problem is discussed for the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations when initial data are specified on two branches of a bifurcate Killing horizon. In the latter case it is assumed that the principal null directions of the Maxwell tensor coincide with those of a Killing bivector. A theorem specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for such space-times to be Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> is derived and consequences of this with respect to Israel's theorem and Robinson's theorem are discussed.
The physical content of the three more natural models of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GL(4)</em> gravity is analyzed, for the case of weak fields. The first model we deal with is the linearized version of Yang's onetensor-field gravity. It is shown that this is a scalar-tensor theory, with its scalar part contained in the symmetric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>αν</sub>, instead of appearing explicitly, externally to the symmetric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>αν</sub>, as happens in Brans-Dicke type of scalar-tensor theories. The second and the third linearized models, which can both be derived from the fourth-order action postulated by Yang, turn out to be two-tensor decoupled systems. In both cases one of the tensors is the symmetric weak metric gravity tensor field. The second tensor appearing in these two models, representing the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GL</em>(4)-gauge field, is either a linearized symmetric affinity (in the second model) or a linearized but nonsymmetric affinity (for the third model). It is shown that in these last two cases the affinity contains a helicity-3 propagating field. The connection is also given between the fourth-order system which determines the dynamical structure (for the last two models) of the metric tensor and the third-order Yang model of gravity. Owing to the presence of helicity-3 fields we show that it is better to regard Yang's action as an action for a two-tensor system instead of trying to recover from it a pure gravity (one-tensor-field) action. Finally, it is shown what is the dynamical structure of the second and third linearized two-tensor models which can be derived from Yang's action.
This paper deals with a particular case of Lyra's modification of Riemannian geometry in which the consequences of the thermodynamic equilibrium of a gravitating fluid sphere have been considered. These considerations lead to a zero red shift in this static model.
Basic relationships between the causal connectivity properties and the symmetry group invariance properties of space-time manifolds are discussed with a view to applications in the theory of stationary black holes. In particular the results given here provide a rigorous justification for the application of Israel's theorem [6] to static black holes as strictly defined; they also provide an essential step in the proof of the “no-hair” theorem for stationary-axisymmetric pure vacuum black holes as described by Carter [29] and extended by Robinson [10]. One of the main results is the demonstration that if the causality axiom holds, the domain of communications of any stationary domain has the form of a fiber bundle over a well-behaved base manifold and that if also the invariance group is orthogonally transitive and the stationary domain is simply connected, then the domain of communication coincides with the stationary domain, so that the corresponding<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">globally</em> defined horizons coincide with the relevant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">local</em> isometry or Killing horizons.
Long-standing problems concerning the structure of the energy-momentum tensor and the thermodynamics of a polarized medium are reexamined in the light of an exact, fully relativistic kinetic model.
The motion of a charged test body around a massive charged source can be described by the Klein-Gordon equation with gravitational and electromagnetic fields. When this equation is transformed into a coordinate system rotating with angular velocity Ω, it is found that for each state with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ=R(u)/uY</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j,k</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ, φ)</em> exp<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iωt</em>, there is a corresponding rate of rotation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n,j,k</em> </sub> at which the general reiativistic Klein-Gordon equation approximately simplifies into a Schrödinger-Kepler equation, whose characteristic energies differ from those of the equation for a hydrogenlike system because the coupling factors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GmM</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">qQ</em> must be multiplied by (1+4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E/mc</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sup>) and (1+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2E/mc</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, respectively, in the general reiativistic case. The energy levels in the fixed frame are found to be-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħω</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">fixed</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħω</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rtating</em> </sub>-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħkΩ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n,j,k</em> </sub>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n,j, k</em> are the principal, angular momentum, and azimuthal quantum numbers. Applied to the case of a pair of rotating charged bosons of zero spin, the resulting fine structure agrees with the known fine-structure levels of this problem. Applied to the motion of Mercury around the Sun, the first-order calculation gives a rate of perihelion precession of 42.98 sec arc/century. If the Sun and Mercury had electrical charges<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>, then to the first order the rate of precession would be approximately 42.98 (1−3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em>) sec arc/century. (Here<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> is the ratio of the electric to gravitational force.) Consideration of upper limits on the field strength on the surfaces of the Sun and Mercury, indicated by Stark shifts and molecular binding energy, show that the electric part of the rate of precession, (−129y), is far below 0.1 sec arc/century, and so need not be considered in the test of general relativity based on Mercury's perihelion precession.
Completing the preceding paper, the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom in expanding Robertson-Walker universes is studied in detail using rigorous methods of functional analysis. Thereby, for closed universes (spherical case,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>=1), the corresponding electromagnetic field needs special considerations. For the hyperbolic case (ε=−1) it is shown (a) that the Hamilton operator is uniquely self-adjoint, (b) that the continuous energy spectrum agrees with the one in 4-flat space-time and that the energy eigenvalues are bounded by±<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">0</em> </sub>, (c) that they approach Minkowski space spectrum for increasing curvature radius, and (d) that the hydrogen atom cannot be used as an atomic clock showing proper time. For the spherical case (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>=1) it is shown (a) that the Hamilton operator is uniquely self-adjoint and (b) that the energy spectrum is solely discrete.
This paper aims at the study of the Cauchy problem for the general relativistic perfect magnetofluid. The consistency and uniqueness condition to be satisfied on the hypersurface by three unknown quantities in the magnetohydrodynamic field equations is obtained. For unit magnetic permeability the result agrees in form with that of Lichnerowicz.
The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravitation (“general relativity with spin”) provides a specific spin-spin contact interaction of matter, in addition to the usual long-range gravity. This new interaction enables us to prevent singularities in Cosmological models. It is shown how this mechanism works in the case when the standard Einstein-Cartan equations are valid at a microphysical level, and some spin-spin terms remain from the averaging procedure for randomly distributed spins. In contrast with the case of aligned spin distributions, it is possible to take over the isotropic and spatially homogeneous (i.e., Friedmannian) models into the Einstein-Cartan theory. These models can be made free from singularity, thanks to the self-interaction of spinning fluid.
We derive the most general equations of motion in the post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity for a bounded system of extended bodies with arbitrary internal structure and internal motions, and we explore in detail the conditions under which the motion of the bodies deviates from the geodesic motion.
Space-times with timelike Killing vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> and axial Killing vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> are studied. Physical coordinates are constructed for the metric of differentially rotating matter. It is proved that, for matter flow whose streamline tangents are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">βη</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup>, the matter region must be either Petrov type I or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>.
This essay aims at demonstrating the interest for a genuine continuum mechanics and, more restrictively, elasticity of general-relativistic systems in cases where the Einsteinian gravitational picture cannot be deleted, e.g., in “elastic” gravitational-wave detectors and in the study of elastic oscillations of solid stars. The same foundations, constitutive theory, and methodology (superimposition of perturbations on finite initial states) apply to both cases, which also demand a generalization to comprehend electrodynamical-mechanical couplings, electroelasticity in the first case (use of piezoelectricity), and magnetoelasticity in the second case (presence of extremely intense magnetic fields).
This paper implements an idea suggested by Penrose and MacCallum. Starting from the twistor equation for a symmetric two-index spinor, it provides a derivation of expressions for energy momentum and angular momentum of an isolated gravitational system at future null infinity in general relativity. The approach employed here is rather straightforward and is related to symmetries in a convincing way.

A survey of current investigations of space-time singularities is given. The different approaches adopted by various research schools is discussed, and an analogy is drawn between this study and the mounting of an expedition that sets out on a long trail of discovery. A heuristic discussion is given of the latest classification of singularities and some brief comments are made on how physically relevant each type of singularity is. Roughly speaking, it seems that the milder types (at which physical quantities remain well behaved) are pathological cases, whereas the crude “big-bang” type of singularity is more generic.
A massive vector field inside the event horizon created by the static sources located outside the black hole is investigated. It is shown that the back-reaction of such a field on the metric near<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0 cannot be neglected. The possibility of the space-time structure changing near<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0 due to the external massive field is discussed.
Field equations for plane waves are set up and some solutions are obtained. Transverse, longitudinal, and mixed waves are possible. In the purely transverse case the energy density is positive definite. In the purely longitudinal case it may be negative. However, in one example investigated it is positive if the Riemannian metric tensor satisfies a condition corresponding to space-time having satisfactory physical properties.
Exact solutions are sought by taking the generated particles of spin 1/2 (according to the creation rate of Schäfer and Dehnen [1]) as matter sources of the Cosmological equations of JBD theory. There exists one exact solution for which the “gravitational constant” decreases linearly with time and the mass of the universe increases proportionally to the square of its age (Dirac's hypotheses). The radius of curvature increases linearly with time while the density decreases inversely with it. It is found that for an age of the universe ≃ 10<sup>−22</sup> sec only two particles have populated the universe. This is assumed to be the initial state of the model. The calculated present particle number and their density are in agreement with the observed data. This model implies that all present matter (excluding the two initial particles) has been created by the expansion of the universe.
A simple local geometric condition is given that is sufficient to restrict the possible variety of exterior fields of all stationary axisymmetric black hole spaces to depend only on a finite number of parameters. It is discussed how this condition could be used to gain insight into the nature of the Carter-Robinson uniqueness theorem. Also a new coordinate system is constructed for all stationary axially symmetric space-times possessing a bifurcate Killing horizon. It covers a whole neighborhood of the horizons and of the bifurcation axis and possesses special geometric properties that are easy to visualize. The Kerr metric together with its spin coefficients and Weyl tensor components are described in the new coordinates.
The classical theory of the interaction of a neutral spin-1/2 Dirac field and the gravitational field is studied. For the purely gravitational part of the Lagrangian, written in terms of a vierbein and the local connection coefficient ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aμb</em> </sub>, (regarded as independent field variables), the usual first-order form is adopted. For the Dirac part, however, a different choice is made, in which the covariant derivative of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> is built with the aid of the vierbein instead of with ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aμb</em> </sub>. This still yields a first-order formalism, but one in which ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aμb</em> </sub> is related to the vierbein in the same way as it would be in the absence of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>. This ensures that the global connection Г<span class="Stack"> <sub>μν</sub> <sup>α</sup> </span> remains symmetric in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> in the presence of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>. The way in which the vierbein field equation leads to a familiar Einstein equation with a symmetric and conserved stress tensor on its right side is also analyzed.
For the class of axisymmetric gravitational fields originally treated by Bondi, the existence of a two-dimensional family of asymptotically shear-free slices (good slices) of null infinity is exhibited. They form a real two-dimensional submanifold (miniheaven) of the four-dimensional complex manifold of good slices (heaven) constructed by Newman. The real good slices can be described as surfaces of revolution of geodesic curves. Geodesic deviation due to the Bondi news function gives rise to the geometrical properties of miniheaven. These properties are examined for the special case of axisymmetric Robinson-Trautman solutions. The Robinson-Trautman family of shear-free null hypersurfaces corresponds to a geodesic in miniheaven possessing an infinite number of angular momentum and supermomentum constants of the motion. The global properties of the Robinson-Trautman miniheaven are examined in the linear approximation in which a remarkably simple expression for the curvature of miniheaven is found. The asymptotic properties of miniheaven turn out to be identical to those of the original Robinson-Trautman space-time.


Adding gravitational self-interaction to general relativity in an intrinsic way changes drastically the behavior of a physical system under gravitational collapse. In our analysis of this question for homogeneous and isotropic matter distributions we show that (i) the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(1,3) gauge theory of gravity of the Yang-Mills type has the correct Newtonian limit for the late universe, (ii) it defines intrinsically a dynamical gravitational stressenergy-momentum tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>, and (iii) negative self-energy always prevents homogeneous and isotropic matter from forming a big-bang singularity; if the present universe disposes of a positive self-energy, pair creation on the eve of the lepton era generates sufficient gravity to stop the fatal collapse.
Spatially homothetic cosmological models are defined as space-time manifolds acted on by a 3-parameter group of transformations transitive over spacelike hypersurfaces, whose effect is to multiply the metric by a constant conformal factor. Previous work on these models is reviewed briefly and the algebraic classification scheme of Eardley is described. Explicit forms of the metric and group generators are given for each class in terms of a conformally synchronous coordinate system using an invariant orthogonal basis of 1-forms. It is shown that certain subclasses are necessarily incomplete in the sense that a singularity of the conformally synchronous system must develop within a finite time.
This paper is concerned with the class of exterior stationary axisymmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that arise from sources in which the mass is proportional to the charge and the angular momentum is proportional to the magnetic moment. With the use of Ernst's formulation the Einstein-Maxwell equations for this class are reduced to two coupled equations for two unknowns.
Within the confines of conventional general relativity, variational principles are analyzed in which the metric tensor and the asymmetric linear connection are varied independently. The constraint that space-time remain Riemannian is introduced by means of the Lagrange multiplier technique. The Lagrange multiplier which effects this constraint, the hypermomentum current, is closely related to the constraint “force” which keeps space-time Riemannian and should be a measure for the violation of the Riemannian constraint at the microscopic level.
This paper shows that a new class of axially symmetric static electrovacuum solutions and the Kerr solution are obtainable from the van Stockum metric. The new class contains an infinite set of asymptotically flat solutions (in closed form), each of which involves an arbitrary set of parameters. The parameters have to be interpreted as functions of mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>, and higher electric multipole moments<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> of the particle. The case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>=0 leads to the Darmois metric. Well-known and new examples are given.



A maximally symmetric space, i.e., homogeneous and isotropic at every point, possessing totally antisymmetric torsion is dealt with. It is found that maximum symmetry restricts the dimension of the space to three. The three-curvature tensor for the space is obtained and from its form a three-metric is then constructed. The three-space is then allowed to evolve in time so that a four-metric of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>= −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup>+ (3)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup>is possible. From this an equation of motion is obtained which predicts an initial- and final-state singularity.
The Eastbrook<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> Whalquist definition of a spatial tensor analysis is compared with Massa's. It is shown that the second approach includes the first one as a special one. Lavoro eseguito nell'ambito dell'attività del Gruppo Nazionale della Fisica Matematica del C.N.R.
A geometrical interpretation of the shear-free condition, required by Robinson's theorem, is given. In particular it is proved that the shear-free condition for a (geodesic) null congruence is necessary and sufficient in order that the null conditions be preserved along the rays.
It is pointed out that an Einstein-Cartan sphere must bounce outside the Schwarzschild radius, if it bounces at all. Except in extreme cases the presence of torsion does not appreciably alter the conditions of the gravitational collapse of stars.
The connection between symmetric and skew-symmetric Killing tensors is studied. Some theorems on skew-symmetric Killing tensors are generalized, and it is shown that in all type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum metrics admitting a symmetric Killing tensor, this Killing tensor can be given in terms of a skew-symmetric Killing tensor.
Let (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>1</sub>) and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>2</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>1</sub>) be time-oriented space-times. Let<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sub>i</sub>(p,q) be the supremum of lengths of future directed causal curves in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>. If<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> is not in the future of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(p, q)</em>=0. A distance homothetic map<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> is a function from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub> onto<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>2</sub> which is not assumed to be continuous, but which satisfies<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sub>2</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(p),f(q))=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cd</em><sub>1</sub>(p,q) for all<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p,q</em> ε<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub>. If<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub> is strongly causal, then the distance homothetic map<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> is a diffeomorphism which maps<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>1</sub> to a scalar multiple of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>2</sub>. Thus for strongly causal space-times, distance homothetic maps are homothetic in the usual sense. When<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub> is not strongly causal, distance homothetic maps are not necessarily differentiable nor even continuous. An example is given of a space-time which has discontinuous maps which are one to one, onto, and distance preserving.
The metric for the standard static Einstein model of the universe can be expressed in coordinates for which a congruence of spacelike world lines of the model will be twisting. A method of “shifting the twist” has been devised by which the twist on spacelike world lines is shifted onto the timelike world lines. The model universe then becomes Gödel's model. A combined Einstein-Gödel model containing a parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> is obtained. Switching<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> from +1 to −1 will effect the shift of twist in the world lines and lead from the Einstein model to the Gödel model.
As a first step toward a proper treatment of compact objects in binary systems the attraction force of two massive bodies connected by a rod is calculated in a post-Newtonian expansion. Contrary to a calculation by Weyl und Bach we start without specializing the internal structure of the bodies. We consider general anisotropic pressures and do not require axial symmetry for the bodies. We calculate the attraction force first in a post-Newtonian approximation and then (in paper II) we shall be concerned with the post-post-Newtonian approximation. In both approximations we obtain Newton's attraction force<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>S1</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>S2</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup> plus terms of order 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>3</sup> and higher, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>S1</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>S2</sub> are the Schwarzschild masses of the bodies.
The attraction force of two massive bodies connected by a rod is calculated in a post-post-Newtonian approximation. As far as we know this is the first calculation in such an order of approximation. Although the result already shows a complicated field-field interaction, we reproduce Newton's attraction force<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>1</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>2</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup> as the leading term in powers of 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>.
New, physically motivated static sources for the Reissner-Nordström metric are found. One is a generalization of the Schwarzschild interior solution representing a sphere of constant nongravitational energy density. The other is a family of solutions for which the mass is electromagnetic in origin. Some general results are found. For a charged fluid sphere in equilibrium with pressure,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup> &gt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sup>2</sup>. For a charged body with equation of state ρ=ρ (p), where ρ(0)=0, the body is under tension at every point when the charge density has the same sign throughout.
A scheme is presented by which we can obtain static electrovac exterior solutions from the stationary gravitational fields given by Kerr and Tomimatsu and Sato. A five-parameter solution of the combined Einstein-Maxwell equations is given that describes a source containing mass, electric charge, magnetic dipole, higher multipole moments of all three kinds and angular momentum. These are generated by using Kinnersley's method from Wang's electrovac solutions, which, in turn, were generated from the gravitational fields of Tomimatsu and Sato for δ=2–3. All the solutions are asymptotically flat.
A new variational principle based on the affine connection in space-time is proposed. This leads to a new formulation of general relativity. The gravitational field is a field of inertial frames in space-time. The metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> appears as a momentum canonically conjugate to the gravitational field. In the case of simple matter fields, e.g., scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, Proca fields, or hydrodynamical matter, the new formulation is equivalent to the traditional one. A new formulation of conservation laws is proposed.
In the Yang-Mills formulation of gravitational dynamics based upon<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>) spin transformations acting on Dirac spinors, the vacuum field equations are ζ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>κα</sub> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>κρασ</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>ρσ</sup> = 0 and and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\triangledown _{\left[ {\kappa ^R \lambda } \right]v} = 0\)</span>. Here<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κα</em> </sub> is the Ricci curvature and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>μκαν</sub> is the Weyl conformal curvature; ξ is a coupling constant. We show the equivalence between solutions of these equations and the vacuum Einstein equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>κα</sub> = 0. The proof uses the Newman-Penrose formalism.
We give the complete analytical description of the null trajectories in the field of a Kerr naked singularity. Two peculiar phenomena are described: the existence of repulsive barbiers in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> &lt; 0 world and the existence of null circular bound orbits which surround the singularity in “shells.” They distribute around the surface at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r = m</em>, which is the position of the horizon in the extreme black-hole case; this suggests that a naked singularity “remembers” the position of the last horizon.
We study Maxwell's equations in a static, axisymmetric vacuum space-time. For any such background metric a solution is found, which far from all masses goes over into a homogeneous magnetic field parallel to the axis of symmetry.
The Sakharov theory of gravitation is examined from the viewpoint of the analogy between gravitation and elasticity. It is found that, by using the Cattaneo-Zel'manov projection technique, the deformation tensor connected with the gravitational field can be considered the deformation tensor of a suitable elastic medium. By supposing that transversal waves propagate in this medium with velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>, one can find an explicit expression for the time dependence of the gravitational constant. Some applications of cosmological interest are briefly discussed.

In a Weyl space it is possible to construct geometrical clocks along timelike geodesics using projective and conformal techniques. We present a precise definition of the limiting processes involved and prove analytically that the clock readings coincide with an affine parameter of the Weyl connection.
It is shown that Einstein-Maxwell complex space-times with self-(anti-self-) dual Weyl tensor and algebraically general anti-self-(self-) dual Maxwell tensor are completely characterized as quasi-Kählerian space-times with vanishing scalar curvature. Following Penrose's interpretation of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-spaces, we propose that an “electrified<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-space” be interpreted as a nonlinear graviton in interaction with a photon. Two families of exact solutions are presented as examples.
It is well known that the Maxwell equations are connected to Minkowski space-time and to the Poincaré group. If we pass to the De Sitter universe with constant curvature, i.e., to the “projective relativity,” we must generalize the Maxwell equations in such a way to make them invariants for the Fantappié group. We thus obtain more general equations which can be interpreted as equations of magnetohydrodynamics and which reunite in a single theory electromagnetism and relativistic hydrodynamics.
The spinor form of linearized gravitation on a curved vacuum background is obtained from the Bianchi identities. There are no Buchdahl constraints to be satisfied, and for a flat background the approach reduces to the usual massless spin 2 theory. The equations are specialized to the plane-fronted impulsive gravitational wave backgrounds which include the ultrarelativistic limit of a moving black hole. Given a solution of the resulting system, it is possible to construct the metric perturbations up to gauge terms. It is shown that this linearized scheme is equivalent to the proposed twistor Hamiltonian formalism. As an example, colliding plane impulsive waves are considered, and the model compares well with the known exact solution. A discussion is given of the application of these methods to ultrarelativistic black-hole encounters.
A method is given for investigating the ultrarelativistic encounter of two black holes which complements the usual low-speed approximation. It depends on the fact that the ultrarelativistic limit of a moving Schwarzschild black hole is a certain plane-fronted impulsive gravitational wave. This enables linearized theory on a curved background to be used. The solution is obtained, with the help of generalized function techniques, to the first order in the background energy, and the radiation pattern at conformal null infinity is examined. The whole approach has a strong connection with the theory of twistors.
The reduced gravitational field equations are derived for algebraically special space-times with twisting geodesic and shear-free rays for a large class of Ricci tensors. These equations coincide with those derived by Trim and Wainwright under more restrictive assumptions on the Ricci tensor. Penrose's conformal technique is used to facilitate computation and interpretation of the results. The remaining coordinate freedom and freedom in the choice of tetrad is discussed.
We construct the energy-momentum tensor in Minkowskian space-time for Einstein's collisionless system of test particles moving in concentric circles and obtain the four-force necessary to preserve equilibrium. We derive a tensor field, satisfying the linearized Einstein equations, which is consistent with the applied four-force. If the particles are contained within a sphere, then outside the sphere we show that the tensor field is a linearized Schwarzschild field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">with a cosmological constant</em> (this constant being the “potential energy” calculated on the surface of the sphere).
In this paper, we extend Kuchař's analysis [1] to geometrodynamics driven by sources of arbitrary spin: starting from a given matter action added to ADM's gravitational action, we derive the corresponding Hamiltonian. We next calculate the strong value of the Poisson brackets of the constraints. Our general derivation leads to Deser-Isham [9] and Dirac's results [4] when applied to the particular cases of pure geometrodynamics and geometrodynamics with a spin-1/2 field.

The relation between field equations and the motion of space-time singularities is discussed. Conditions are found for the validity of the Infeld-Plebański equations of motion in the case of Robinson-Trautman space-times. The covariance is studied, and it is shown that covariance with respect to coordinate transformations, slightly more general than linear ones, is possible only in case of spherical symmetry.
The problem of finding certain algebraically special solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with radiation is investigated using the formalism of Newman and Penrose.
We give a modification of the Palatini Lagrangian for the free gravitational field that yields the vanishing of the torsion as a result of the field equations and requires only the assumption of the symmetry of the metric. We transcribe this Lagrangian into the tetrad formalism and show how the tetrad form of the Einstein field equations follows from it. Some remarks on possible generalization to a theory with nonvanishing torsion in the presence of matter conclude the paper.
It is shown that the usual proof of the second law of black hole physics breaks down if there are tachyons present in the vicinity of a black hole. Explicit cases are discussed where a tachyon of positive energy falling into the Kerr singularity actually decreases the area of the Kerr black hole.
Synge's approximation procedure is applied to calculate the spin precession of either body in a binary system consisting of two rotating, spherical, rigid bodies of comparable mass and radius. The calculations are valid for the case in which the mass-radius ratio of each body, as well as the ratio of the radius of either body to the distance between their centers, is small. The results agree with those of earlier authors, who use different techniques, except for a term that arises from the effect of the rotation on the stress within the bodies. This term is similar in form to the quadrupole term of Barker and O'Connell, which they obtain when they allow the bodies to become distorted under the influence of the rotation.
The Schwarzschild geometry is approximated by a certain set of conformally flat shells. As an example of the use of this approximation, the transmission coefficient<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> for spherical waves of monochromatic scalar radiation imploding on the black hole is calculated by solving the scalar wave equation within each conformally flat space and matching across the interfaces. The results agree with those of other authors for low and high frequencies and give values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> at all intermediate frequencies.
The connection between the deformed twistor space of Penrose and Plebanski's form for the general right-flat metric is explored. A Hamiltonian formalism for obtaining the twistor surfaces in a right-flat space with Plebanski's Ω-function as Hamiltonian is obtained.

Creation of matter is possible in the cosmological context, without cost of energy. This creation is regulated by the laws of quantum mechanics and general relativity. These elements are used to conceive a singularity-free causal open homogeneous isotropic cosmology. The history of the universe unfolds in two stages: the “fireball” production stage, which occurs as the response to a spontaneous local disturbance, is followed by free expansion. The latter extrapolates back to the former to avoid the initial “big-bang” singularity.
We propose new definitions for the momentum and angular momentum of Einstein-Maxwell fields that overcome the deficiencies of earlier definitions of these terms and are appropriate to the new<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-space formulations of space-time. We make our definitions in terms of the Winicour-Tamburino linkages applied to the good cuts of CI<sup>+</sup>. Our transformations between good cuts then correspond to the translations and “Lorentz” transformations at points in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>-space. For the special case of Robinson-Trautman type<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">II</strong> space-times, we show that our definitions of momentum and angular momentum yield the previously published results of Ludvigsen.
We show that the set of nonreflecting points<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> is without interior in the space-time. We also construct a space-time in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> is dense in some open subset of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M.
A global definition of irreducible mass for the odd-δ T-S metrics is investigated. We find that its expression in terms of the source parameters is the same for all the members of the family and reduces to the formula that holds in the Kerr case (δ=1). As a consequence, we show that processes with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>ir</sub> = const no longer imply zero variations of the horizon's area for δ&gt;1.
The field equations for stationary, axisymmetric, nonconvective perfect fluid are presented. A solution corresponding to a rigidly rotating cylinder with constant pressure is derived. Some properties of this solution are discussed.
We have obtained relations between certain components of the metric and the electromagnetic potentials for source-free Brans-Dicke-Maxwell fields described by a nonstatic cylindrically symmetric Einstein-Rosen metric. These are important, in the sense that they generate a class of solutions that in a way can be said to belong to the class generated by similar relations obtained by Majumdar [1] and Papapetrou [2] for generalized static Einstein-Maxwell fields. The relations have further been used to reduce the B-D Maxwell equations to B-D vacuum equations and vice versa.
General properties of Einstein-Maxwell spaces, with both null and nonnull source-free Maxwell fields, are examined when these space-times admit various kinds of symmetry mappings. These include Killing, homothetic and conformal vector fields, curvature and Ricci collineations, and mappings belonging to the family of contracted Ricci collineations. In particular, the behavior of the electromagnetic field tensor is examined under these symmetry mappings. Examples are given of such space-times which admit proper curvature and proper Ricci collineations. Examples are also given of such space-times in which the metric tensor admits homothetic and other motions, but in which the corresponding Lie derivatives of the electromagnetic Maxwell tensor are not just proportional to the Maxwell tensor.
General results of the theory of separability for the geodesic equation in (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>n</sub>, g) are applied to deduce the canonical form of a separable metric with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>- 2 Killing vectors. Applications to vacuum space-times with two Killing vectors are investigated.
We discuss quantizing the perturbations of a symmetrical background space-time and are led to study the quantum analogue of linearization instabilities. We outline the derivation of the second-order quantum constraints that arise whenever perturbations of symmetric space-times with compact Cauchy surfaces are quantized. These second-order constraints require invariance of all the allowed quantum states (not just the “vacuum” state) under the symmetry group of the background space-time. This result is discussed in light of the conclusion by Gibbons and Hawking that the thermal radiation produced by event horizons in de Sitter space is invariant under the de Sitter group and thus does not admit a semiclassical interpretation.
Perhaps one of the main reasons for believing in the cosmic censorship hypothesis is the disquieting nature of the alternative: the existence of naked singularities, and hence loss of predictability, the possibility of closed timelike lines, and so forth. The consequences of assuming the cosmic censorship hypothesis can also be somewhat strange and unexpected. In particular, we apply Hawking's black hole area theorem to the study of particle orbits near a Schwarzschild black hole. If the cosmic censorship hypothesis (and hence the area theorem) is true, then there exist stable near-circular orbits arbitrarily close to the horizon at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>.
Nonstationary, spherically symmetric solutions of the coupled field equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>μυ</sub>=2φ,<sub>μ</sub>φ,<sub>υ</sub> and □φ=0, in which the coupling polarity is opposite to the orthodox, are derived. The basic solution, termed the evolving, flowless drainhole manifold, has these properties: (1) geodesic completeness; (2) a topological hole that shrinks to a point at a singular event and immediately begins to expand back to infinite size; (3) multiple branching of geodesics that arrive at the singular event; (4) asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity, luminal infinity, and temporal infinity; (5) isometric symmetry under time reversal and under space reflection through the drainhole; (6) conformal symmetry under space-time dilatations that leave the singular event fixed, and also under space-time inversions that interchange the singular event and a point at infinity. An earlier, static drainhole solution of the same equations was able to represent an ordinary star's external field or to serve as a model of a simple gravitating or nongravitating particle, replacing in these capacities the Kruskal-Fronsdal-Schwarzschild black-hole manifolds. The evolving, flowless drainhole can be thought of as modeling the death and rebirth of a scalar particle that is infinitely large in the infinite past and the infinite future. This particle does not gravitate, for the “ether flow” whose spatial variations in the static drainhole solution are identified with gravitation is removed from consideration in the evolving, flowless drainhole solution by being turned off at the outset. What is left is space alone, evolving dynamically in accordance with the field equations.
New solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations are presented. The solutions describe the gravitational fields of a massless charge.
Synge's approximation method is applied to derive the orbital equations for a binary system consisting of two rotating, spherical, rigid bodies of comparable mass and radius. Approximations are based on the weakness of the field and on the distance between the bodies being considered large by comparison with their radii.

An experimental verification of Einstein's equivalence principle has been made using an atomic hydrogen maser in a space probe attaining an altitude of 10,000 km above the earth's surface. At the present stage of the data reduction, confirmation is at the 2×10<sup>−4</sup> level of accuracy. The experiment and the resulting data are described including a comment on the limits to the anisotropy of the velocity of light. We believe that this is the first direct, high-accuracy test of the symmetry of the propagation of light and a beginning in the use of high-accuracy clocks in space to measure relativistic phenomena.
Stimulated by ideas occuring in supergravity, we develop a gauge theory of gravity based on a spin-3/2 Majorana field. Our theory has no metric or vierbein as an elementary field. Classically the theory is in complete agreement with Einstein's metric formulation, but quantum mechanically it differs from ordinary formulations, including supergravity, on the fundamental nature of gravitation. In our approach gravitation arises from a collective effect due to spin-3/2 gravitinos.

It is shown that, similarly to general relativity, the bimetric theory of gravitation predicts the formation of primordial minicompact objects. Contrary to general relativity, however, it predicts that such objects are stable. Observational consequences are discussed.
A nonlocal spinor field theory of electromagnetically neutral matter is developed in which both gravitational field and its source emerge from a quadrilocal extension of the complex Weyl spinor, the sources finding expression in terms of the local limit of the derivatives with respect to the internal coordinates of that part of the nonlocal field that indeed vanishes locally. The structure of the nonlocal field is dictated by its field equations, which are obtained using a prescription suggested by a manifestly covariant reformulation of the field equations derived by Fröhlich for a bilocal extension of the complex Maxwell spinor. As in the electrodynamic case the additional (complex) components (three in the gravitational case) act as potentials for the matter current, which is identified through the identity of the inhomogeneous field equations obtained for the field intensities with the form assumed by the Bianchi identities when matter is introduced via the Einstein equations. The conservation of source is shown to follow directly from the initial homogeneous, nonlocal field equations, and in the weak-field, nonrelativistic limit a simple expression, in terms of the nonlocal field, is obtained for the mass density associated with the matter source. A satisfactory derivation of the Lorentz equation of motion for charged sources, on the other hand, is still lacking, pending a synthesis of the Maxwell and Weyl fields, some remarks on wich, together with a speculation concerning the quantization of the bilocal Maxwell field, conclude the work.
A spherical surface layer is considered in the four-dimensional description based on the existence of essential discontinuities of the first derivatives of g<sub>λμ</sub>. An error contained in a previous publication [1] is corrected and the new results are compared with those obtained by using the formalism of Israel.
This paper gives an algorithm for generating solutions of the Einstein field equations which have an irrotational perfect fluid, with equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=μ</em>, as source, and which admit a two-parameter Abelian group of local isometries. The algorithm is used to derive a variety of new and known spatially homogeneous cosmological models, both tilted and nontilted. However, since the solutions in general only admit two Killing vectors, spatially inhomogeneous models are also obtained. Finally, it is pointed out that the solution generation technique used in this paper is closely related to solution generation techniques that have been used to generate solutions of the source-free Brans-Dicke field equations, and of the Einstein field equations with a massless scalar field as source.
It is shown that the only empty space solution of the type “flat space plus the square of a null vector” whose singularities are confined to a bounded region is the Kerr metric.
Recent results concerning isometric embeddings of Schwarzschild space-time and its maximal extension are given. It is shown that Kruskal's manifold can be embedded into R<sup>7</sup> as an algebraic subvariety. A discussion of the importance of this embedding is given.
Through an examination of the Bohm-Aharonov experiment, we shall propose a new theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. The fundamental assumption of our theory is that the motion of a particle in a combination of gravitational and electromagnetic fields is determined from a variational principle of the form δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>A</sub> <sup>B</sup> </span>dτ = 0. The form of the physical time is determined from an examination of the Maxwell-Einstein action function. The field and motion equations are formally identical to those of Maxwell-Einstein theory. The theory predicts that even in a field-free region of space, electromagnetic potentials can alter the phase of a wave function and the lifetime of a charged particle. The phase alteration has been observed in the Bohm-Aharonov experiment. There is an indication that the lifetime alteration has shown up in a recent CERN storage ring experiment. Experimental tests are proposed.
We consider the question of whether the “correct” theory of gravity is a metric theory. The metric hypothesis is shown to place severe restrictions on the form of the equation of motion for the one-body problem. By relaxing these restrictions we include nonmetric contributions to the equation of motion, and the solution in the post-Newtonian approximation is given. The solution given here contains five arbitrary parameters in place of the usual two (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β, γ</em>) of metric theories. One of them produces a secular change in the eccentricity; the others contribute to the perihelion advance and to periodic terms. Only certain combinations of these parameters can be determined even from orbits with different eccentricities.
We determine in closed form the electrostatic potential of a point test charge held at rest in a static, spherically symmetric Brans-Dicke field. This result is a generalization of the previously obtained expression for the potential of a test charge at rest near a Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, our solution is valid for the coupled gravitational and massless scalar fields.
A prescription is given for point splitting in a curved space-time background which is a natural generalization of that familiar in quantum electrodynamics and Yang-Mills theory. It is applied (to establish its validity) to the verification of the gravitational anomaly in the divergence of a fermion axial current. Notable features of the prescription are that it defines a point-split current that can be differentiated straightforwardly, and that it involves a natural way of averaging (four-dimensionally) over the directions of point splitting. The method can extend directly from the spin-1/2 fermion case treated to other cases, e.g., to spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger fermions.
The conjecture that geodesics in the Kerr matric with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a &gt; m</em> cannot violate causality in the sense of meeting a turning point before making up for lost time, is found to be untrue for null geodesics.
The equations describing the moment of inertia and the dragging of inertial frames of slowly rotating neutron stars are derived according to Rosen's bimetric theory of gravitation. Numerical calculations of the properties of neutron stars according to the bimetric theory and general relativity were made using several equations of state. The general trend found is that in the bimetric theory neutron stars with a given mass induce a smaller dragging of inertial frames than in general relativity. The moment of inertia of low-mass stars also is smaller in the bimetric theory. For high-mass stars, however, the moment of inertia is found to be larger in the bimetric theory.
An attempt is made to extend the Wheeler and Feynman absorber theory of electromagnetic radiation to the case of the gravitational field (described by the Einstein linear weak-field equations) on the assumption that the source is at the center of a sphere of matter having a density equal to the average density in the universe and a radius equal to the reciprocal of the Hubble constant. It is found that near the source the field of the matter is negligible compared to that of the source, so that one can conclude that the gravitational field generated by the source is time-symmetric (one-half advanced plus one-half retarded). One can conclude that a physical system does not lose energy as gravitational radiation, although a gravitational wave detector may record signals. It appears that there are no periodic running waves in nature, and hence no gravitons. These considerations hold also in the bimetric gravitation theory.
I discuss the frame-independent geometric structure of gravity and supergravity theories, and their nonlinear Poincaré and super-Poincaré invariances. Then I consider their generalizations to nonlinear de Sitter and super de Sitter invariances. I point out how these generalizations imply restrictions on the universe of propagation of basic fields. Related ideas are also discussed.
In Dixon's theory of the dynamics of extended bodies in metric theories of gravity, a definition of a center-of-mass line is proposed. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a zero-linear-momentum vector field. Using this vector field we show the existence of a center-of-mass line which is a smooth timelike curve contained in a convex hull of the world-tube of the body.
Using the theorem of Poincaré-Hopf we prove the uniqueness of the center-of-mass line (its existence has been shown in a different paper, see [2]) in Dixon's theory of the dynamics of extended bodies in metric theories of gravity.
On the basis of an approximation method developed in a previous paper the motion of an ideal fluid sphere in a weak gravitational background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} &amp; {(in)} \\ {g_{\mu v} = \eta _{\mu v} + \gamma _{\mu v} } &amp; {} \\ \end{array} \)</span> is investigated. The sphere is assumed to be small in the sense that its radius is small compared with the change of the background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu v} } \\ \end{array} \)</span>. Furthermore the deformations of the sphere when accelerated by the background are assumed to be small compared with the extension of the sphere in the absence of acceleration. In the lowest mixed order (mixed of the background<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu v} } \\ \end{array} \)</span> and the retarded potentials of the sphere in lowest order) the equation of motion is yielded by integrating Einstein's conservation law of energy and momentum over the world-tube of the sphere. One obtains an equation of motion for the center of the sphere that is identical with the geodesic line linearized in<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\begin{array}{*{20}c} {(in)} \\ {\gamma _{\mu v} } \\ \end{array} \)</span>. In the case of a static background of a localized matter distribution it is shown that Einstein's energy-momentum complex formed with the retarded potentials from the accelerated motion of the sphere in lowest order (lowest mixed order) leads to an outgoing radiation of gravitational energy. All radiation terms can be expressed in terms of the background and the world-line of the center of the sphere.
The geometry of a projection tensor field in curved space-time is expressed in a way that does not restrict the dimensionality of the projection. The thermohydrodynamics of a perfect fluid then takes a compact and symmetrical form which also describes such exotic media as classical string fluids.
The geometrical structure of the Castelnuovo space-time and the Fantappié group are analyzed with the Inönj-Wigner method of “contraction” of a group with respect to the various subgroups. If we utilize the two vectors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">position</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">velocity</em>, we can study the structure of the magnetohydrodynamics tensor. It follows that from projective magnetohydrodynamics we can deduce as limiting cases four theories (two by two “duals” in the sense of the classical projective geometry).
We investigate the behavior of curves in the space of Riemannian metrics which corresponds to Einstein space-times admitting a Gaussian foliation. Different types of variational principles are formulated and some global dynamical properties of these space-times are obtained.
It is shown that the form of the gravitational field equations is predetermined for a wide class of field theories by the choice of the external field equations.
Scalar densities which are concomitants of the metric tensor, a symmetric affine connection and its first derivative, and the derivative of a vector field are examined. Rather simple demands are imposed on the corresponding Euler-Lagrange expressions. It is found that the associated field equations reduce essentially to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations.
The field equations of the bimetric theory of gravitation are solved for the static, spherically symmetric electric and gravitational fields due to a point charge, subject to certain restrictions.
The bimetric gravitational field of a charged finite body is derived using a method of approximation. It is found that, with certain exceptions, every charged body has a minimum size, beyond which the field variables become singular. For elementary particles this minimum radius is negligibly small.
Within the framework of the gauge covariant theory of gravitation it is showed that a time-dependent cosmological constant arises quite naturally as a result of Weyl conformai symmetry broken by quantum effects.
Generalizing a formalism developed earlier for the scalar field, we propose a covariant quantization procedure for the Dirac field coupled to external gauge fields. Under the assumption of a very natural spectrum condition, physical in and out states are identified by certain analyticity properties in the mass parameter. Several criteria for particle creation are given.
The often-discussed example of the constant electric field is revisited in order to give a concrete illustration of the formalism of the preceding paper and its physical relevance.
A static, plane-symmetric scalar field of long range is considered in general relativity, and a one-parameter class of exact solutions with cosmical time is studied in harmonic coordinates. The geodetic equations are solved. A velocity-dependent acceleration field is found, acting attractively on the component of the velocity normal to the plane of symmetry, and repulsively on the component parallel to that plane. The manifold is complete. Test particles at rest are insensitive to it.

It is shown that a square invariant of the Weyl conformal curvature tensor can lead to a Lagrangian in a variational principle for a gravitational equation in vacuum of the Bianchi identity type which is compatible with the Einstein equation. Moreover we show that such a Lagrangian implicitly includes a conformally invariant theory characterized by two gauge fields and the metric tensor.
We give a new description of unprimed spinors for the nonlinear graviton and use this to prove that the nonlinear graviton is an anti-self-dual solution to Einstein's equations. We also provide a proof of the stability of the normal bundles to the projective lines in curved projective twistor space.
A rigorous setting for Dirac's generalized Hamiltonian dynamics in an infinite number of dimensions is presented. It is shown that the dynamical formulation of general relativity fits into this scheme.
It is proved that the post-Newtonian general relativistic center of rest mass of a bounded physical system composed of a number of bodies characterized by finite dimensions, arbitrary internal structure, and arbitrary internal motions cannot in general move uniformly, contrary to what was conventionally accepted up to now. Mathematical expressions are derived and discussed describing, in terms of the above characteristics of the bodies, the position and velocity vectors of the center of rest mass of the system and the force, which is responsible for its nonuniform motion, with respect to the uniformly moving post-Newtonian general relativistic center of inertial mass of the physical system. In the special case of a binary star it is shown that the center of rest mass should describe, around the uniformly moving center of inertial mass, an ellipse of the same period and eccentricity as those of the Newtonian elliptical orbit of the relative motion. The length of the axes of this ellipse depends on the internal characteristics of the members of the binary star, and the motion of the center of rest mass becomes important when these characteristics are strong enough. Finally, it is proved that in every effort for describing theoretically a binary system, the internal characteristics of the members of which are ignored, and for accurate measurements of their positions and velocities, the above fictitious motion of the center of rest mass has to be taken into account; otherwise, the results of the measurements will not be consistent with the theoretical predictions.
A Lorentz-covariant theory of gravitation is proposed. It is based on a simple form of the Lagrangian for the gravitational field. The field equations have a simple mathematical structure where the energy-momentum tensor of matter and of gravitational field is the source of the field. The theory agrees with general relativity for the three well-known effects, i.e., red shift, deflection of light, and perihelion.
It is shown that in an asymptotically flat space-time (<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">M</span> ,g) a “flat metric”<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>μv</sub> can be naturally determined so that the energy and momenta of the space-time are covariantly defined by the Landau-Lifshitz complex. Specifically, it is shown that the asymptotic form of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>μv</sub> determines uniquely the asymptotic form of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>μv</sub> to such an extent that the Landau-Lifshitz energy and momenta (a) are independent of the remaining freedom in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>μv</sub>, (b) are equal to the corresponding components of the Bondi energy momentum, and (c) transform as components of a free Lorentz vector under general BMS transformations. Thus the Landau-Lifshitz prescription is completely equivalent to the Bondi method.
An inductive flux of gravitational momentum in Newtonian theory, and a radiative flux of gravitational momentum in general relativity, while being physically dissimilar quantities, are shown to be formally equivalent by expressing them in terms of a symplectic form on the solution space of the respective field equations. The conditions under which the relativistic flux may be considered inductive are then investigated, and a physical example of how this might occur is given in the setting of a strongly curved space-time.
The J. Scherk and J. H. Schwarz generalization of a Peres solution is shown to be the Peres solution in a different system of coordinates.
Pregalactic black holes accrete matter in the early universe and produce copious amounts of x radiation. By using observations of the background radiation in the x and γ wavebands we have been able to impose a strong new constraint upon their possible abundance. If pregalactic black holes are actually present, several outstanding problems of cosmogony can be resolved with typical pregalactic black hole masses of 100M<sub>⊙</sub>. Significantly more massive holes cannot constitute an appreciable mass fraction of the universe and are limited by Ω<sub>PGBH</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>)&lt;10(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>⊙</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">JM</em>)Ω<sup>−1</sup>.
In the bimetric theory of gravitation with a flat-space background metric conservation laws for energy and momentum are considered in several different forms. In the bimetric theory with a constant-curvature background metric a previous error in the energy-momentum relation is corrected.
With the help of the formalism of [3] (hereafter referred to as Paper I) we show that a high static torsion step produces particles. We thereby verify earlier expectations that the spin contact interaction of the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravitation provides a new mechanism for matter creation as compared with Einsteinian relativity.
We give the equations governing trajectories in black hole space-times, and present a guide to the literature-a “who did what” annotated reference list.
Motivated by the need for stronger observational leverage on the black hole hypothesis and for a more detailed characterization of axisymmetric accretion flows across the marginally stable circular orbit at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inms}</em>, we develop a general approach for describing the non-Keplerian accretion in the region<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inH}⩽r⩽ r{in0}</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inH}</em>≡ radius of the event horizon and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{in0}⩾r{inms}</em>. Our procedure possesses many advantages, including easily imposed consistency with the Keplerian model for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r&gt;r{in0}</em>, the avoidance of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> boundary conditions at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inms}</em> and/or at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inH}</em>, and its application also to accretion in Rosen's bimetric theory, whose spherically symmetric solution has the same qualitative orbital topography as that of general relativity. It becomes apparent, furthermore, that the particular viscosity law chosen in our procedure will have a crucial bearing on the flow in the region<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r{inms}&lt;r&lt;r{in0}</em>.
The Weyl axially symmetric electrovac formalism for coincident gravitational and electrostatic equipotential surfaces is used to generate charged versions of some axially symmetric vacuum fields. The metric for two separated charged Curzon particles held in equilibrium by a strut is found and the condition for the removal of the strut is discussed. Kinnersley transformations applied to the two-particle metric yield spin but line singularities invariably appear along the symmetry axis and the metric is asymptotically NUT-like. It is shown that any Kinnersley transformation applied to a static axially symmetric asymptotically flat vacuum metric generates another asymptotically flat metric only if the latter is static. Moreover, the transformed metric is always undercharged (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sup>2</sup>&lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup>) if it is asymptotically flat. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic flatness in terms of the relevant parameters is found. A generalization of the Kinnersley transformation scheme is presented and illustrated by an example.
We present here some exact solutions of Einstein equations; they depend on one variable and take into account a cosmological constant or an electromagnetic field.
Ehlers' and Rudolph's generalization of Born rigidity is analyzed and some properties of the corresponding flow field are derived. We investigate if at the center of motion pseudorigidity reduces to Born rigidity and give some weak criteria for determining if a given motion is pseudo rigid.
It is shown that the “hidden” symmetry of the stationary Einstein equations under the group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) can be extended to a symmetry under the group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(3,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) in the case of Jordan's five-dimensional, unified theory. More generally one obtains an action of the group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) on the set of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+4)-dimensional Einstein spaces admitting a (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1)-parameter Abelian group of isometries.
The present situation of quantum field theory in curved space-times is briefly described. It is argued that we have reached a new phase in the transfer of quantum field theoretical methods from flat to curved space-time: the adaptation of the various approximation methods and related techniques from atomic and elementary particle physics. In support of the argument that several elaborated techniques can easily be transcribed, the author sketches his transcription of the quasiclassical approximation, till now used for pair creation in time-variable electric fields in Minkowski space, to the problem of cosmological particle creation.
The strong gravity contribution to the nucleonic axial-vector form factor is evaluated in the nonrelativistic limit and in the approximation of exact<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>3</sub> symmetry. It is suggested also that the anomalous experimental results on the value of the axial coupling constant, in very light nuclei, may be explained as being an effect due to strong gravitational interactions.
In constructing solutions of the stationary Einstein-Maxwell equations two global integrability conditions arise. That one of these conditions may be interpreted as an equilibrium condition has been shown in an earlier paper [1]. In that paper I also put forward the idea that the second condition also was an equilibrium condition. In this work I suggest a more reasonable interpretation for this second condition.
Einstein's equations with a perfect fluid source are subjected to compatibility conditions in the context of a space-time that contains symmetric subspaces. These conditions constitute, in some cases, a powerful tool for exhibiting the solutions to a given problem. The Schwarzchild interior metric in conformally flat coordinates is derived using these methods.

We examine critically the persistent belief that the physical interpretation of a quantum field theory in curved space-time is to be found by introducing a notion of particles at each time in terms of the exact eigenstates of some energylike operator at that time. It seems that all straightforward implementations of this principle suffer from either ambiguity or failure to produce finite particle densities and renormalizable energy-momentum tensors. Calculations are done for a cosmological model of Bianchi type I, containing a scalar field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em> whose equation includes the term ξ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Rφ</em>. Diagonalization of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">total energy</em> suggests a certain particle definition, which, however, yields a finite particle creation rate only when ξ=1/6 and the universe is isotropic. Diagonalization of a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">canonical Hamiltonian</em> is a prescription loose enough to be made consistent with almost any ansatz (including one that does yield physically acceptable expectation values), hence of no theoretical value. An apparently successful naive approach to the isotropic case (for any ξ) is explained as an unconscious first approximation to an adiabatic analysis of the notion of positive frequency.
The classical field equations of the strong gravity theory are modified by introducing spin and torsion so as to resemble the field equations of the Einstein-Cartan theory. The effects of the hadronic spin upon the strong metric are evaluated using a semiclassical approximation, and it is pointed out that the torsion contributions are not negligible. A possible interpretation of the Cabibbo angle as a strong gravity correction of the weak semileptonic Lagrangian is suggested.
The quantum theory of massless fields in an asymptotically simple space-time is developed. The Schwinger dynamical principle and the Penrose conformal technique are exploited to derive the commutation relations on proper null surfaces in a curved space-time and on null infinities. The explicit expression for the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> matrix in an asymptotically simple space-time is presented. The general expression for a density matrix describing particles created in an external field is also given and its possible applications are discussed briefly.
It is shown that a space-time admitting a nonsingular 2-form satisfying the source-free Maxwell equations and a Lorentzian involution under which the 2-form and the exterior derivative of a related 2-form are skew invariant while the trace-free Ricci tensor and the covariant derivative of the involution itself are invariant possesses locally an invertible 2-parameter Abelian isometry group with nonsingular orbits.

The method of path integration is used to study the effects of quantum fluctuations in the space-time geometry near the classical singularity of general relativity. It is shown that in certain special cases explicit Feynman propagators can be constructed which enable us to evaluate these fluctuations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quantitatively</em>. The cases discussed are (i) the gravitational collapse of a uniform dust ball, (ii) the Friedmann cosmologies, (iii) the axisymmetric Bianchi type I cosmological model, and (iv) the general anisotropic Bianchi type I cosmological model. In all cases discussed here the quantum uncertainty grows to infinity as the classical space-time singularity is approached. In this wider regime of quantum gravitation nonsingular solutions can occur with finite probabilities.
We give a Lorentz-covariant description of the system of two gravitating particles by considering it as a system of two Einstein relativistic particles interacting via the gravitation field. The resulting model gives the correct description of the motion of Mercury relative to the Sun.
A symmetry principle is proposed which in the case when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>enjoys sufficient symmetry helps to pick out the physically relevant solution to Einstein's equations.
The representation of the world function Ω of the Schwarzschild field as a power series is investigated. Initially we concern ourselves with a neighborhood of the event horizon. The symmetries of the metric are invoked effectively to reduce the number of independent variables upon which Ω depends from eight to four, and to show that when these are sufficiently small in magnitude Ω is an analytic function of them. A fairly large number of the early terms of the power series for Ω is found explicitly. The condition that one is to remain sufficiently close to the event horizon is then relaxed, it being merely stipulated that the endpoints shall be sufficiently close to each other. Finally, using other variables, the early terms of a series for Ω are obtained for the case in which the endpoints are restricted to lie outside the event horizon and sufficiently close to each other.
A discussion is presented which indicates that a stagnation point is being reached in the standard applications of symmetries (especially isometries) in general relativity. In order to continue the advance of this area of research, an attractive alternative is suggested. This alternative involves the use of what are termed “intrinsic symmetries.” With this technique, emphasis is placed on underlying symmetries of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">sub</em>manifolds. One particular set of symmetries gives rise to an invariant formulation of the Szekeres inhomogeneous cosmological models, and suggests quite natural generalizations.
Solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in six dimensions are investigated which exhibit the compactification of two dimensions into spheres with varying radii and which are Schwarzschild-like in the other four dimensions. The stability of the spontaneous compactification solutions is discussed too.
Taking<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u, v)dudv+r</em><sup>2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u, v</em>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>Ω<sup>2</sup>as the generic form of the metric from the out-set, a singular energy momentum tensor is determined which may formally be regarded as the source of the Kruskal metric. The result obtained is in harmony with the earlier work of Tangherlini.
The propagation of gravitational waves in cold matter has been analyzed in the geometrical-optics approximation showing no difference from the propagation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">in vacuum</em>. In a cosmological background a plasmalike dispersion relation has been shown to appear in the postgeometrical optics approximation only. A qualitative discussion of the physical meaning of the present result is given and compared with previous works.




The Schmidt [9]<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>-boundary<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M</em>, for completing a space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, has several desirable features. It is uniquely determined by the space-time metric in an elegant geometrical manner. The completed space-time is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> ∼α<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ō</em><sup>+</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M/O</em><sup>+</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ō</em><sup>+</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the Cauchy completion (with respect to a toplogical metric induced by the Levi-Cività connection) of a component of the orthonormal frame bundle having structure group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em><sup>+</sup>. Then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M</em> consists of the endpoints of incomplete curves in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> that have finite horizontal lifts in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ō</em><sup>+</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em> we say that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>-complete. It turns out that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>-complete if and only if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em><sup>+</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is complete. This criterion for space-time completeness is stronger than geodesic completeness and Beem [1] has shown that this remains so even for the restricted class of globally hyperbolic space-times. Clarice [3] has shown that for such space-times the curvature becomes unbounded as the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>-boundary is approached.</p><p class="Para">Now if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M≠φ</em>, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ō</em><sup>+</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> may contain degenerate fibers; thus the quotient topology for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em> is non-Hausdorff and precludes a manifold structure. Precisely this has been demonstrated by Bosshard [2] for Friedmann space-time, casting doubt on the physical significance of the completion. The only neighborhood of the Friedmann singularity is the whole of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯M</em>, and in the closed model initial and final singularities are identified in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂M</em>.

A null Cavendish experiment is proposed for testing the validity of the inverse square gravitational force law: one searches for spherically·symmetric excitations in a hollow spherical fluid-filled resonator in the presence of a mass quadrupole rotating at half the lowest resonant frequency of the fluid sphere. By Gauss' law, there is no nonstatic Newtonian coupling to the resonator. The experiment can be made sensitive enough to detect a Yukawa-type force with a strength less than 10<sup>−3</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and a range on the order of 10 cm.
We study monopole perturbations of spherically symmetric scalar-vacuum and scalar-electrovacuum fields in general relativity and reduce the problem to a one-dimensional Schrödinger-like equation with a certain effective potential. Imposing certain boundary conditions, we select physically meaningful perturbations. Some of them grow exponentially and we conclude that the background system is unstable.
The effect of unitary inequivalence of different versions of the formalism of quantum gravity, according to the arbitrary choice of coordinate conditions, does not mean a violation of general covariance but a furcation of a single classical theory into several inequivalent, but also generally covariant quantum theories. We choose a version closely analogous to the theory of Proca, with a strong supplementary condition, leading to a quantum gravity with a cosmological term. However, it is only the bare but not necessarily the dressed cosmological term that has to be different from zero. Ordinary theory without the cosmological term may be obtained by renormalization.
The problem of global energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum in Rosen's bimetric theories of gravitation is considered from the point of view of motions of the background space-time. It turns out that by means of background Killing vectors global mechanical integrals for matter and field can be defined in a correct manner. For the flat-background bimetric theory conditions are obtained which have been imposed on the algebraic structure of the matter tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> </span> in order to get global mechanical conservation laws. For bimetric gravitation theories based on a cosmological (nonflat) background the set of Killing vectors is found. For these theories the obtained restrictions on the algebraic structure of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> </span> lead to global generation laws (instead of conservation laws in the flat-background theory) for mechanical quantities. In particular cases the generation effect vanishes and then conservation laws exist. By means of the method developed in this paper, Rosen's homogeneous isotropic universe in the framework of the cosmological-background bimetric theory with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=1 is considered. It turns out that such a universe does not generate globally, but will generate locally. The global energy of this universe is found to be zero.
A method is presented which enables one to obtain solutions to the stationary axially symmetric Brans-Dicke fields coupled to source-free Maxwell fields from the solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations in Einstein's theory. The Brans-Dicke analog of the Kerr-Newman solution has been obtained as an example.
Bekenstein and Hawking saved the second law of thermodynamics near a black hole by assigning to the hole an entropy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> proportional to the area of its event horizon. It is tempting to assume that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> possesses all the features commonly associated with the physical entropy. Kundt has shown, however, that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> violates several reasonable physical expectations. We review his criticism, augmenting it as follows: (a)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> is a badly behaved state function requiring knowledge of the hole's future history; and (b) close analogs of event horizons in other space-times do not possess an “entropy.” We also discuss these questions: (c) Is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> suitable for all regions of a black-hole space-time? And (b) should<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> be attributed to the exterior of a white hole? One can retain<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>h</sub> for the interior (respectively, exterior) of a black (respectively, white) hole, but we reject this as contrary to the information-theoretic derivation of horizon entropy given by Bekenstein. The total entropy defined by Kundt (all ordinary entropy on space-section cutting through the hole, no horizon term) and that of Bekenstein-Hawking (ordinary entropy outside horizon plus horizon term) appear to be complementary concepts with separate domains of validity. In the most natural choice, an observer inside a black hole will use Kundt's entropy, and one remaining outside that of Bekenstein-Hawking.
By using the horizon entropy, Hawking showed that a stable black hole will form inside a radiation cavity of finite energy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> and small enough volume,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V⩽V</em><sub>h</sub>(E). But two heuristic considerations seem to contradict this. First, a spontaneous fluctuation large enough to form a hole is so improbable that the chance of one developing even in 10<sup>10</sup> years is negligible. Second, any such hole should not be in equilibrium, let alone stable; it should evaporate away again because the radiation, with typical wavelength ∼16 times larger than the hole, can hardly be accreted. Study of the combined accretion and evaporation resolves this difficulty. It confirms the prediction of stability and it does so without appeal to the concept of horizon entropy. A state of pure radiation is actually favored over one including a hole when 1⩾<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V/V</em><sub>h</sub>&gt;0.2556, but the reverse holds for smaller cavity volumes. The horizon entropy of a black hole plays a natural role; it helps determine the system's evolution and equilibria through the condition that the total entropy of hole plus radiation always tends to increase. Using the known temperature of the hole and the fact (deduced from the accretion formula) that energy flows from the hot body to the cold, one easily inverts the reasoning to derive a unique value for the black-hole entropy.
The Reissner-Nordström geometry is approximated by a certain sequence of conformally flat shells. As an example of the use of this approximation, spectral curves of transmission coefficient<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T(w)</em> vs. frequency<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> are calculated for spherical waves of monochromatic scalar radiation imploding on the charged black hole by solving the scalar wave equation within each conformally flat space and matching across the interfaces. Spectral curves are found for several values of the charge that are less than or equal to the mass. For small charge, the results agree with those previously found in the Schwarzschild case.
Perjes and Israel and Wilson have given independently a new class of solutions of the sourcefree Einstein-Maxwell equations, which can be interpreted as the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a spinning source with unit specific charge. Starting from Zipoy's solutions in oblate and prolate spheroidal coordinates for the source-free gravitational field we generate some axially symmetric stationary solutions of the source-free Einstein-Maxwell equations by using Perjes' method. All these solutions become Euclidean at infinity. The asymptotic behavior and the singularity of the solutions are studied in order to gain some insight into the nature of the source. The solution in prolate spheroidal coordinates is found to contain closed timelike lines.

Let (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g)</em> be a space-time with Lorentzian distance function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. If (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) is distinguishing and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> is continuous, then (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) is shown to be causally continuous. Furthermore, a strongly causal space-time (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) is globally hyperbolic iff the Lorentzian distance is always finite valued for all metrics<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g′</em> conformal to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>. Lorentzian distance may be used to define cut points for space-times and the analogs of a number of results holding for Riemannian cut loci may be established for space-time cut loci. For instance in a globally hyperbolic space-time, any timelike (or respectively, null) cut point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> of p along the geodesic<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> must be either the first conjugate point of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> or else there must be at least two maximal timelike (respectively, null) geodesics from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>. If<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> is a closest cut point of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> in a globally hyperbolic space-time, then either<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> is conjugate to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> or else<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> is a null cut point. In globally hyperbolic space-times, no point has a farthest nonspacelike cut point.
We show that a material with sufficiently large elastic shear modulus or shear viscosity will act like a gravitational conductor or “metal.” It will reflect gravitational waves, and it can be used to make gravitational waveguides and circuits. Unlike electromagnetism, a gravitational wave can be guided by a single conductor in transverse mode. Gravitational conductors can obey the dominant energy condition, and they can be larger than their Schwarzschild radius, but they must violate a new condition that is probably satisfied by all existing forms of matter. Direct-current gravitational circuits, although limits of guided gravitational waves, have a simple Newtonian interpretation.
The precession of a gyroscope is calculated in a nonrelativistic theory due to Harbour which satisfies Mach's principle. It is shown that the theory predicts both the geodetic and motional precession of general relativity to within factors of order 1. The significance of the gyro experiment is discussed from the point of view of metric theories of gravity and this is contrasted with its significance from the point of view of Mach's principle.
Maugin's Scheme for a relativistic perfect magnetofluid is used to study the convection-free stress and convective deformations of the matter tensor for the magnetofluid. It is proved that the convection-free stress of the magnetofluid implies the conservation of the pressure, the density, and the magnitude of the magnetic field along the flow vector. The relation between convective deformations of the matter tensor for the magnetofluid and deformation tensor is obtained.
General relativistic gravitational theories are constructed from suitable intransitive continuous groups of transformations. A minimal invariant variety forms the unperturbed universe. The formalism of the group is generalized to have the symmetry of its action on this manifold broken by gauge potentials. The theory is expressed in these potentials and it is shown how the present symmetry breaking is related to a general metric. The physical interpretation of the formalism is outlined.
Ambiguities of gravitational field measurements are resolved in the linearized version of general relativity. A potential energy of a mass quadrupole in a gravitational field is found which permits determination of the linearized Weyl tensor. A<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gedanken</em> spin resonance experiment is devised to measure the magnetic-type components of the Weyl tensor; the experiment confirms the observability of these components when they are suitably averaged over a world domain.
Previous work on spin, rotation, and quantum effects in gravitation is surveyed, with particular emphasis on the gravitational two-body interaction, both for elementary particles and for macroscopic bodies. Applications considered include (a) the precession of a gyroscope, (b) rotational effects on the equations of motion for the orbit, (c) binary systems, particularly the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16, and (d) the prospects of measuring spin-orbit and spin-spin forces in the laboratory. In addition, we discuss quantum effects that arise in the interaction between elementary particles. In particular, we point out the potentially decisive role of these forces in high-density matter, with emphasis on the fact that repulsive forces arise that may prevent gravitational collapse. All of the above considerations are within the framework of Einstein's theory of general relativity, albeit extended to treat spin-dependent and quantum forces. Finally, we consider the additional quantum terms that are present if one works with a generalization of Einstein's theory, the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravitation, in which the spin of matter, as well as its mass, plays a dynamical role.
This paper deals with the construction of “magnetic vorticity” vector using Greenberg's theory of spacelike congruences for the trajectories of magnetic fields. A set of propagation equations is derived for the geometrical invariants associated with the congruences of magnetic field lines and fluid flow lines. Some applications of these propagation equations are made. A generalization of Ferraro's law of isorotation is obtained employing the propagation equation for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> <sup>2</sup> along the magnetic field lines.
The connection between Lie derivatives and the deviation equations has been investigated in Riemannian spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> <sub>n</sub>. On this basis the deviation equations of the geodesies have been obtained, in spaces with symmetries, as well as deviation equations of nongeodesic trajectories, through imposing certain conditions on the Lie derivatives with respect to the tangential vector of the basic trajectory.
The model of a homogeneous isotropic universe is studied in the presence of gauge fields, noninteracting dust, and two extra compact dimensions. It is found that the singular “big bang” type solution can be rejected because of the drastic growth of the radius of the universe. On the other hand, solutions without singularity can be found showing a very rapid oscillation (Planck frequency) with small amplitude around the data prescribing the present status of the universe.
It is shown that the stationary solution of the Einstein equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">in vacuo</em>, with the cylindrical symmetry obtained by Lewis, does not contain a space-time that is globally Minkowskian. It is shown that the inclusion of a certain constant of integration excludes this flat space-time metric.
We investigate the stability of the nakedness of the Weyl singularities against matter perturbations by considering the effects of infalling test matter on the convergence of outgoing null rays. We show that the additional convergence induced by infalling test matter does not blow up sufficiently fast to reconverge diverging outgoing rays, at least in the equator, and the nakedness seems to be stable in this limited sense.
A simple form and its physical interpretation are presented for a solution of the momentum constraint in the initial-value problem of general relativity.

The Robinson, Schild, and Strauss explicit solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations is considered. Two subclasses of this solution are determined: (i) the class of metrics for which both eigenvectors of the Maxwell field are eigenvectors of the Weyl tensor, and (ii) the class of metrics of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>.
A class of solutions, which may be called the Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) class, has been derived for static coupled zero-mass and source-free electromagnetic fields. This has been done in two stages. First, it has been shown that the well-known MP relation between the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub> component of the metric tensor and the electrostatic potential, in certain physical situations, continues to remain the same without being affected by the presence of the zeromass field. Second, using the method of Majumdar, we have developed a theorem that enables one to generate solutions for the coupled field from Einstein's vacuum equations and the solution of a differential equation which, due to its resemblance, may be called a generalized Laplace equation.
It is shown that Mach's principle and the general principle of relativity are logical consequences of a “materialistic postulate” and that general relativity implies the validity of Mach's principle for a static (or quasistatic) homogeneous and isotropic universe, spatially self-enclosed. The finite velocity of propagation of gravitational field does not imply a retardation of inertial forces due to the distant masses and therefore does not exclude the validity of Mach's principle. Similarly, the experimentally verified isotropy of inertia is compatible with this principle. The recent observational evidence of very high isotropy of the actual universe proves that the “anti-Machian” Gödel world model must be rejected as a nonphysical one. This suggests the possibility of a renaissance of Einstein's first cosmological model by considering-in the spirit of an older idea of Herbert Dingle-a superlargescale quasistatic universe consisting of an unknown number of statistically oscillating regions similar to our own, momentarily expanding, metagalaxy.
The observational and philosophical grounds for our belief in the spatial homogeneity of the universe, are reconsidered. On the one hand, spatial homogeneity cannot be directly verified observationally, and, on the other hand, it raises a series of philosophical problems that counter its attractiveness to a considerable degree. It is pointed out that there are several possible alternative approaches to the question of the homogeneity of the universe that may provide at least as attractive a philosophical basis as the current approach and that merit detailed investigation as possible alternative bases for our cosmological world view.
With a tetrad formalism, the leading terms near the center of a stationary rotating star are determined from Newtonian analogy and Einstein's equations. These are expanded to second order in the radius and it is shown that they are inconsistent with the metric being Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>.


The path-integral approach to quantum field theory assigns special importance to finite action Euclidean solutions of classical field equations. In Yang-Mills gauge theories, the instanton solutions of classical field equations with self-dual field strength have given rise to a new, nonperturbative treatment of the quantum field theory and its vacuum state. Since gravitation is also a species of gauge theory, one might think that similar phenomena would occur in gravity. The authors recently sought and found a new self-dual solution to Euclidean gravity which plays a role parallel to that of the Yang-Mills instanton. Gravitational instantons now promise to yield new insights into the nature of quantum gravity.
A new, generally applicable technique is described for constructing solutions of a coupled linear system of partial differential equations when a decoupled equation has been derived. This method has already yielded an extremely simple derivation of perturbation formulas given by Cohen and Kegeles and by Chrzanowski as well as new formulas for the complete solutions of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations describing Reissner-Nordström perturbations. It is hoped that it will prove valuable for many other applications.
The calculation of the invariants of the Weyl tensor for the Tomimatsu-Sato δ = 3 solution is reported.
It is shown that only for spins 1 and 2 (electronmagnetism and gravitation) does the generic integer spin, source-free, zero-rest-mass field generate an irreducible representation of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>+↑. The conclusion is then drawn that as these higher-spin fields can in no sense be considered as elementary we have strong mathematical (and physical) grounds for their (apparent) nonexistence in nature.
In the present paper the field equations of general relativity have been solved to obtain a solution for a static charged fluid sphere. This solution is free from singularity and satisfies the necessary physical conditions.
This paper shows that a new class of axially symmetric static electrovacuum/magnetovacuum solutions is obtainable from Weyl's class of static vacuum solutions. The new class contains an infinite set of asymptotically flat solutions (in closed form) each of which involves an arbitrary set (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>, α<sub>i</sub>) of parameters. These parameters have to be interpreted as functions of mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>, and higher electric/magnetic multipole moments<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> of the particle. The case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> = 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>=0 leads to the Darmois solution and the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> = 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>≠0 leads to the results of [1]. The case d≠=0, e=α<sub>i</sub>=0 leads to the Schwarzschild solution, the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>≠ 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>=0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>≠ 0 leads to the Reissner-Nordström solution. To get more general examples is a lengthy but straightforward exercise.
Exact solutions of field equations representing static perfect fluid cylinders and plane layers, with possible inclusion of electromagnetic or scalar field, are constructed and discussed. For the case of cylindrical symmetry, conditions at a regular axis are formulated and examples of regular solutions are presented. For planar and pseudoplanar configurations some limitations are obtained concerning existence of mirror symmetry in the thickness direction. These limitations make such symmetry rather unprobable, thus giving evidence that realistic models for equilibrium disklike configurations should be nonstatic (rotating). A configuration described by Teixeira, Wolk, and Som, possessing planar plus mirror symmetry (the case of disordered radiation), is shown to be unphysical.
Given the four-velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> describing the motion of a continuous medium, the covariant derivative<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>) may be uniquely decomposed in terms of the vorticity tensor Ω, the expansion tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>, and the four-acceleration<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C.</em> In the present paper we examine the integrability conditions on the fields Ω,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> ensuring the existence of a four-velocity field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>.
The most general metric that admits a vector field with zero covariant derivative is derived. Some special cases are exhibited.

It is shown that the effect of a gravitational field on a hydrogen atom is to admix states of opposite parity such as 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>1/2</sub> and 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sub>1/2</sub> The phase of this admixture is such as to produce circular polarization of the radiation emitted in transltions such as 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>1/2</sub>→1<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>1/2</sub>+γ which arises from the interference between the gravity-induced amplitude and mat due to the weak neutral current. The predicted magnitude of the circular polarization, which could be sufficiently large to be detected in white dwarfs or in certain binary systems, varies from theory to theory. It is thus possible that a study of this effect could provide a feasible means of testing general relativity at the quantum level.
If the early universe was highly anisotropic, primordial black holes may have formed prolifically (despite previous claims to the contrary) even if the initial density fluctuations were small. However, the holes would initially be endowed with an immense amount of shear, so it is not obvious that they would evolve into the conventional type of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">stationary</em> black hole envisaged by the “no hair” theorem. If they do settle down to a stationary state, it may only be on a considerable time scale; and in principle there might exist soliton-type solutions which represent holes with shear which persists indefinitely. Such “shear hell holes,” as we term them, could have even more dramatic properties than the usual stationary holes: in particular, they might be prolific generators of gravitational radiation and they could be associated with interesting quantum effects.
We consider the problem of finding the quantum mechanical phase associated with the propagation of a particle in a given external gravitational field, and conclude that it is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m∫ ds.</em> In weak fields<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μυ</em> </sub> this allows us to calculate the gravitationally induced phase on a freely traveling particle as 1/2 ∫<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μυ</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em> </sup> is the ordinary momentum. This formula has the expected Newtonian limit and is then used to calculate effects in matter wave interferometry such as those due to gravity waves and the “dragging of the ether frame” by rotating bodies. Light wave interferometry is then considered and is shown to be also described by 1/2 ∫<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μυ</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em> </sup> is the wave vector of the light, and the integral is along the path of the ray. Matter and light wave interferometry are compared in various cases.
The general principles of the electromagnetic detection of gravitational waves are discussed. A critical comment on a previous paper by Baierlein [1] devoted to the same problem is given.
CAMAL is a collection of computer algebra systems developed in Cambridge, England for use mainly in theoretical physics. One of these was designed originally for general relativity calculations, although it is often used in other fields. In a recent paper Cohen, Leringe, and Sundblad compared six systems for algebraic computations applied to general relativity available in Stockholm. Here we give similar information for CAMAL, and by using the same tests we add CAMAL to the comparison.
We discuss some geometrical properties of Killing forms of order three and exhibit a procedure for constructing spaces admitting such tensors. As an example we prove that all conformally flat spaces admitting such a tensor are related to spaces of constant curvature.
We demonstrate that for a large class of Lagrangian-based torsion theories a macroscopic gyroscope is insensitive to the torsion field: There can be no coupling of the torsion to the gyroscope's angular momentum of rotation. To detect torsion a polarized system with a net elementary particle spin is needed. These conclusions are evident from the conservation laws, which form the basis for deriving the equations of motion.
Space-times with plane symmetry are considered which also admit a conformal group such that the metric depends on the variable<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z=x</em><sup>1</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>0</sup> (homothetic or self-similar solutions). Different regions depending on the space-time character of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> can be discerned in each solution: the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> region when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> is timelike and the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em>-region when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> is spacelike. Exact solutions of the Einstein equations are given for an energy-momentum tensor corresponding to an ideal fluid with equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=(λ-1)e</em>. Different types of solutions occur depending upon the value of λ in the equation of state, and these are studied using phase-plane methods. The solutions of considered type in the Minkowski space-time are also given.
Counterexamples are given to Wheeler's “rule of unanimity,” which implies that every quantum solution for the problem of a closed universe within the framework of Einstein's field equations leads to a singularity. Bianchi IX universes filled with a perfect fluid with an equation of state of the type ρ=(λ−1)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> (λ=const, between 1 and 2), quantized in the framework of the canonical scheme proposed by Lund and generalized by Demaret and Moncrief, are indeed shown to be nonsingular, apart from a set of measure zero of models including the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models.

This paper contains the Kerr-Schild-Vaidya fields with axial symmetry (all metric functions independent of Vaidya's coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em>) in closed form. The general problem of Kerr-Schild pure radiation fields without any symmetry can be reduced to a single partial differential equation by means of Kerr's theorem.
We state a purely geometrical framework apparently implementing Machian ideas on inertia. Only coupling constants dimensionless in natural units have been introduced in the theory. In any<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nonvacuum</em> cosmos the field equations describing the gravitational phenomena in cosmological units turn out to be identical to Einstein's equations, with the Einstein gravitational coupling expressed in terms of the parameters defining the cosmological structure. This dependence, however, is not detectable. Indeed, such equations do not need to incorporate the standard Machian requirements (apart from the requirement that they are not conceivable in the total absence of matter) in order to be Machian, since, just on the basis of Mach's principle, one cannot expect to be able to detect Machian effects in Nature by using a system of units based on gravitational phenomena. On the contrary, the equations describing the gravitational field in local atomic units are Machian in the standard sense and, in particular, they incorporate the ideas that the frame has to be fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">directly</em> in connection with the observed distribution and motion of matter and that there does not exist any kind of space-time in the total absence of matter. Finally, to reconcile, at least in the weak-field approximation, Einstein's equations (considered as equations describing the gravitational phenomena in local atomic units) with Mach's principle and to be in agreement with cosmological observations, we suggest that our cosmos be identified with a superuniverse model in which the background structure is homogeneous (in space and in time) and isotropic, while our universe is represented by one of the local inhomogeneities of the background. Then we prove that in any region of our universe in which the gravitational field is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">sufficiently</em> weak and smooth the equations, describing the gravitational field in local atomic units, are expected to approximate Einstein's equations all the better, the more the dimensions of our universe are negligible with respect to the dimensions of the background and the background curvature is small. As regards the experimental predictions of the present approach, any prediction for experiments involving only purely gravitational measurements is identical to that of Einstein's theory and the above result also guarantees<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a fortiori</em> the agreement with the available experimental data, also as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nonpurely</em> gravitational experiments are concerned.
We discuss a recent experiment with interfering neutron beams in the gravitational field of the earth, and show how the explanation of the interference pattern can be obtained by an application of the equivalence principle to the one-particle states. The calculation is carried out in the coordinate system where the gravitational field has been transformed away.
We discuss the “pseudo-Weyl” vacuum field for which the two metric functions, ψ and λ, depend on the three coordinates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ, z</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t.</em> It is shown that no solutions exist that depend on all three coordinates. Consideration is given to the time-dependent metric of Einstein and Rosen and the same (null) result is shown to hold for that case. Thus, the most general solutions to the Weyl-type metric appear to be those already found by Weyl and by Einstein and Rosen.
It is shown that gravitationlike gauge fields can result from compact, internal symmetry groups. In particular, when the global duality invariance of the vacuum Maxwell's equations is made into a local symmetry using the methods of Yang and Mills, the gauge field is found to have certain properties characteristic of gravity. It is conjectured that a realistic theory of gravity can be constructed as a gauge theory based on a compact, internal symmetry group.
The report is given on a local measurement of the absolute velocity of a laboratory. This is the resultant velocity due to all types of motion in which the laboratory takes part (about the Earth's axis, about the Sun, about the galactic center, about the center of the cluster of galaxies).
Starting from a first-order formulation of the Lagrangian of noninteracting massless helicity-2 and helicity-3/2 particles, we deduce global supersymmetry transformations. Then, allowing the supersymmetry transformations to become local requires, if supersymmetry is to be maintained, the introduction of a unique primitive interaction through the “gravitino” stress tensor and torsion. Finally, the imposition of exact supersymmetry invariance leads by a short, constructive process to full supergravity and the complete form of the supersymmetry transformations. In particular, no explicit use is made of general coordinate invariance, and the self-consistency of the gravitational coupling emerges from the local supersymmetry requirement alone.
We study the space-time properties of leptons and hadrons and find it necessary to extend general relativity to the gauge theory based on the four-dimensional affine group. This group translates and deforms the tetrads of the locally Minkowskian space-time. Its conserved currents, momentum, and hypermomentum, act as sources in the two field equations of gravity. A Lagrangian quadratic in torsion and curvature allows for the propagation of two independent gauge fields: translational<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>-gravity mediated by the tetrad coefficients, and deformational Γ-gravity mediated by the connection coefficients. For macroscopic matter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>-gravity coincides with general relativity up to the post-Newtonian approximation of fourth order. For microscopic matter Γ-gravity represents a strong Yang-Mills type interaction. In the linear approximation, for a static source, a confinement potential is found.

It is suggested that gravity may not be asymptotically free at short distances because of the interaction of the graviton with matter. If gravity indeed becomes strong at high energies, a revolutionary change of our present theory on the early universe would seem to be necessary. During the first extremely small fraction of a second in the big-bang universe, gravity would have been so strong that it might not have been described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The possibility of abnormally strong gravity at high energies or short distances is discussed in some detail. A possible explanation is proposed for the nonvanishing mean baryon number density of the universe. It is also pointed out that the universe may well escape from the catastrophic singularity of Penrose and Hawking.
In the presence of gravitational radiation, there are ordinarily no shear-free slices of null infinity. A four-complex-dimensional set of shear-free slices of complexified null infinity do exist. They comprise the manifold ℋ space. In general, there are no preferred real subspaces of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℋ</em> space associated with slices of real null infinity. However, for radiation fields possessing a twist-free axial symmetry, a two-parameter family of shear-free slices of real null infinity exist and therefore pick out a preferred two-dimensional real subspace of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℋ</em> space. In this paper, we study the geometry of these 2-spaces for the particular case of quadrupole radiation fields for which determination of the shear-free slices reduces to the standard problem of determining orbits of a particle moving in a potential. Our principal interest is the investigation of possible singularities caused by sufficiently intense radiation fields. We find that such singularities do occur for radiation fields having the characteristic power<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>5</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>.
A general formal analysis is made trying to obtain a better understanding and greater synthesis of the mathematical structure of the gravitational field's gauge theories. Under this approach, some misstatements appearing in current theories are detected. A theory based on the direct product groups<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>(4)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GL</em>(4) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>(4)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(1, 3) is suggested (in contrast to those using the Poincaré group, semidirect product). Such a theory corrects the justmentioned deficiencies possessing the attributes of the preceding ones.
The problem of finding the most general spinor field possessing the same symmetry as a given gravitational field is solved for every group of motions. Its connection with the resolution of Einstein-Dirac equations is briefly pointed out.
By using a suitable two-point scalar field, a covariant formulation of the Einstein pseudotensor is given. A unique choice of scalar field is made possible by examining the role of linear and angular momentum in their correct geometric context. It is shown that, contrary to many text-book statements, linear momentum is not generated by infinitesimal coordinate transformations on space-time. Use is made of the nonintersecting lifted geodesies on the tangent bundle,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">M</span>, to space-time, to define a globally regular three-dimensional Lagrangian submanifold of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">M</span>, relative to an observer at some point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> in space-time. By integrating over this submanifold rather than a necessarily singular spacelike hypersurface, gravitational linear and angular momentum, relative to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>, are defined, and shown to have sensible physical properties.
That a self-gravitating perfect fluid in empty space has a spherical equilibrium configuration if it is static-i.e., nonrotating-is considered physically evident, but has not yet been rigorously derived from Einstein's field equations together with suitable asymptotic conditions. In this paper the global analysis techniques developed recently mainly by Fischer, Marsden, and Cantor are used to derive the result that if a family of static perfect fluid solutions with fixed total gravitational mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and fixed equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϱ(p)</em> satisfying 0 ⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p ⩽ ϱ</em> and 0 ⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dϱ/dp</em> &lt; ∞ depends differentiably on a parameter and contains the spherically symmetric solution then it must consist of solutions diffeomorphic to the spherically symmetric one.
We prove some existence and uniqueness theorems for the solution of the Lichnerowicz equation:<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(8\Delta _{g\phi } - R_\phi + M_\phi ^{ - 7} + Q_\phi ^{ - 3} + \tau _\phi ^5 = 0\)</span>, on an asymptotically Euclidian manifold. This equation governs the conformai factor of a metric solution of the constraints in General Relativity. In the first part we prove existence and uniqueness under the simple assumption<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>⩾0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>⩾0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>⩾0, τ⩾0, which insures the monotony of the non-differentiated part. In the second part we obtain an existence theorem under more general hypothesis on the coefficients, by use of the Leray-Schauder degree theory. The results of this paper have been announced in [4].
In the present paper the field equations of general relativity have been solved to obtain the different solutions for the static charged gas sphere. These solutions are free from singularities and satisfy the necessary physical conditions.
Paper I analyzed the evolution of nonspherical scalar-field perturbations of an electrically charged, collapsing star; this paper treats coupled electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. It employs the results of recent detailed work in which coupled perturbations were studied in a gauge-invariant manner by using the Hamiltonian (Moncrief s) approach and the Newman-Penrose formalism, and the relations between the fundamental quantities of these two methods were obtained.</p><p class="Para">It is shown that scalar-field perturbations are a prototype for coupled perturbations. The collapse produces a Reissner-Nordström black hole, and the perturbations are radiated away completely. All<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>-pole parts of the perturbations of the metric and the electromagnetic field decay according to power laws; in the extreme case (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2</sup> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sup>2</sup>), the interaction causes the quadrupole perturbations to die out more slowly than the dipole perturbations.
A geometrical framework for obtaining the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">5</em>-operator description of quantum fields interacting with external potentials (including gravitation) is presented. An approach to quantum theory of mutually interacting Bose fields is suggested.
A form of initial value problem is considered in which the initial hypersurface is not spacelike but null. This approach has the striking advantage over the more usual Cauchy problem that all constraints (initial data equations) are eliminated from the theory, for a wide class of interacting fields in special relativity and also for general relativity. The theory is most naturally described in terms of the two-component spinor calculus, for which an elementary introduction is given here. A general scheme for interacting fields, which holds both in special and general relativity, is presented which describes all fields in terms of sets of irreducible spinors. The concept of an exact set of such spinors is introduced and it is shown that this concept is the appropriate one for an initial value problem on a null cone without constraints. The initial data can be expressed in the form of a complex number, called a null datum, defined at each point of the null cone, one corresponding to each spinor. There is the curious feature of these null data that apparently it is sufficient here, to have onehalf as much information per point as in the corresponding Cauchy problem. The classical Maxwell-Dirac theory and the Einstein-Maxwell theory are two examples that can be put into the form of exact sets. The Einstein empty-space equations are also of particular note, and in this case the null datum describes essentially the intrinsic geometry of the null cone. The argument given here as applied to a general exact set is incomplete in two important respects. Firstly it depends on the null data being analytic, and secondly the initial hypersurface must be a cone. However, both these restrictions are removed in the case of certain elementary fields called basic free fields, examples of which are the Weyl neutrino field, the free Maxwell field, and the linearized gravitational field. For these cases a simple explicit formula is introduced which expresses the field at any point in terms of the null datum, as an integral taken over the intersection of the initial null hypersurface with the null cone of the point.

The method suggested earlier is applied to the problem of pair production in the Robertson-Walker universes with scale factors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>λ</sup>, λ⩽1. The method is based on the postulate that the positive-frequency wave functions must be propagated forward in time by the causal propagator. The causal propagator is defined as the Green's function with minimal divergences on the “Euclidean section” of the space-time. The results for the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a(t)=t</em> coincide with those of Chitre and Hartle. In the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a(t)=t</em><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>λ</sup>, λ&lt;1, it is shown that the present approach predicts creation of conformal invariant massless scalar particles. It is demonstrated that the conformal transformation method gives the same predictions provided that the global properties of the space-time are taken into consideration.
In the framework of a new gravitational theory with nonmetric connection recently introduced by one of us (J. K.), it is shown that the matter stress tensors satisfy a certain identity, which, via the contracted Bianchi identities, turns out to be a formal integrability condition for the gravitational field equations. The conservation law for the Hilbert tensor is also discussed.
The classical bremsstrahlung problem is discussed with respect to the global structure of space-time. Various physical phenomena (such as the Hawking effect, etc.) connected with the large-scale structure of space-time are mentioned.

The sets of equations that form the basis for the tetrad formalism approach in general relativity contain considerable redundancy. Papapetrou has determined this redundancy explicitly in the form of three sets of identities and employed these in investigations of the Newman-Penrose tetrad formalism. In this paper Papapetrou's work is reviewed and some of his results that do not seem to be well known are emphasized, along with some general implications. The main new result that is established concerns the Geroch-Held-Penrose formulation of the tetrad formalism. When the sets of equations that are usually used in this formulation are considered in the light of Papapetrou's identities, it is found that certain formal simplifications can be made and that the Geroch-Held-Penrose formulation can be presented more concisely. It is emphasized that the results in this paper apply in the most general case only. Any special cases (e.g., simplified tetrad and/or Riemann tensor) need to be considered separately.
In the “projective relativity” based on the de Sitter universe, Maxwell's generalized theory gives us the magnetohydrodynamics, valid on a cosmic scale, for hyperdense matter and high energies. From the new theory can be deduced as “limiting cases” the hydrodynamics and thermohydrodynamics, the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, the electromagnetism, and the electrohydrodynamics, invariants for the projective Fantappié group.
The Palatini variation of the Einstein Lagiangian is analyzed for a symmetric metric and for a more general sesquilinear (Hermitian) form. In the latter case the Lagrangian is no longer projectively invariant, and the connection is determined to be<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">metrical</em> up to a real λ transformation. The Einstein-Straus equations emerge as a natural<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">geometrical</em> generalization of general relativity.
The scattering of electromagnetic radiation by linearized gravitational fields is studied to second order in a perturbation expansion. The incoming electromagnetic radiation can be of arbitrary multipole structure, and the gravitational fields are also taken to be advanced fields of arbitrary multipole structure. All electromagnetic multipole radiation is found to be scattered by gravitational monopole and time-varying dipole fields. No case has been found, however, in which any electromagnetic multipole radiation is scattered by gravitational fields of quadrupole or higher-order multipole structure. This lack of scattering is established for infinite classes of special cases, and is conjectured to hold in general. The results of the scattering analysis are applied to the case of electromagnetic radiation scattered by a moving mass. It is shown how the mass and velocity may be determined by a knowledge of the incident and scattered radiation.
This paper gives a coordinate-dependent 3 + 1 decomposition of the geodesic law of motion. The equation is similar in form to the equation of motion of electrodynamics except there is an extra term proportional to the rate of change of kinetic energy and the vector potential. The equation is solved for the acceleration explicitly.

A new derivation of the general-relativistic Fourier equation is given for radiation transport by using the principle of conservation of momentum plus some rather simple assumptions. The Fourier equation at which I arrive is not the usual one but has an additional term. For this reason it leads to a hyperbolic equation for heat conduction, thus avoiding the paradox of infinite velocity of heat propagation, which is a consequence of the usual Fourier equation, as the latter one leads to a parabolic equation for heat conduction. The new Fourier equation is compared with the one that was given by Kranys by using ad hoc assumptions.
The interaction of a harmonically bound three-mass system with gravitational waves is analyzed in detail. The system resonantly responds to two polarization states of gravitational waves at a given frequency and transforms the two polarization states into two kinds of vibrations which can be clearly distinguished. The averaged cross section and maximum cross section also are given. As compared with a two-mass system under the same conditions, the three-mass system is at the maximum 1.2 times as large as the averaged cross section of the two-mass system, and its maximum cross section is at the maximum 1.5 times as large as that of the two-mass system.
In a Riemannian space-time, the difference between the third-order tensor potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αβλ</em> </sub> of the Riemann tensor (presented in a precedent paper) and the Lanczos generating function of the Weyl tensor is here shown to be characterized by a vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> </sub>, obtained by contraction<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αβλ</em> </sub>. The significant role of such a vector, in the context of general relativity, is then discussed. Particular attention is paid to the scalar potential ϑ which characterizes the irrotational part of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> </sub>: such a scalar field satisfies a space-time wave equation of the Poisson type. Weak fields are also considered: in the particular case of a static metric, the scalar ϑ is found to be proportional to the classic Newtonian potential.
A static solution to Einstein's equations, which is asymptotically flat near spatial infinity, is shown to be asymptotically Schwarzschildian. As an application of this result we prove a technical lemma on the existence of asymptotically flat harmonic coordinates near infinity.
Equilibrium of charged dust is studied in both the classical and relativistic theories. It is already known that the configuration of the dust is arbitrary if the ratio of the charge to mass densities,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ/ρ</em>, is everywhere ± 1 (in relativistic units). I show here that there are equilibrium configurations for certain other values<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ/ρ</em>, including nonuniform ones. The solutions in these cases are arbitrary up to the choice of a harmonic function and a function of the electrostatic potential. In general they contain singularities.
The iteration procedure of Anderson and DeCanio (1975) for obtaining hydrodynamic equations in the slow-motion approximation to general relativity is modified at each iteration step. These improvements keep all expressions needed for the 2 1/2 post-Newtonian approximation (PNA) manifestly finite, but fail to prevent some divergent terms in the third and higher PNAs. In this Part I, the improvements to the iteration scheme are outlined, and the calculation is completed through the second iteration, yielding Newtonian-like hydrodynamic equations in the first PNA. Paper II will complete the calculation through the 2 1/2 PNA, allowing the calculation of the gravitational radiation reaction force, and making explicit the source of the divergences which occur in the higher PNAs.
In 1975 Møller tried to show that the general relativistic concept of standard time or proper time would lose its physical meaning in the vicinity of singularities of a gravitational field [1]. His treatment of a classical harmonic oscillator clock falling into a singularity is checked in the present paper and is found to be insufficient to prove the above statement. A relativistic clock model is given to ensure the reasonable physical meaning of proper time.
A modification of the general relativity theory is proposed (bimetric general relativity) in which, in addition to the usual metric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub> describing the space-time geometry and gravitation, there exists also a background metric tensor γ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub> The latter describes the space-time of the universe if no matter were present and is taken to correspond to a space-time of constant curvature with positive spatial curvature (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=1). Field equations are obtained, and these agree with the Einstein equations for systems that are small compared to the size of the universe, such as the solar system. Energy considerations lead to a generalized form of the De Donder condition. One can set up simple isotropic closed models of the universe which first contract and then expand without going through a singular state. It is suggested that the maximum density of the universe was of the order of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>5</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ</em><sup>−1</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sup>−2</sup>∼10<sup>93</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The expansion from such a high-density state is similar to that from the singular state (“big bang”) of the general relativity models. In the case of the dust-filled model one can fit the parameters to present cosmological data. Using the radiation-filled model to describe the early history of the universe, one can account for the cosmic abundance of helium and other light elements in the same way as in ordinary general relativity.
The time-dependent creation and annihilation operators for a complex scalar field, in a Friedmann space-time, defining particle states with respect to which the Hamiltonian is diagonal, are related by a Bogoliubov transformation to the creation and annihilation operators defined in strict analogy with the procedure carried out in Minkowski space. The Bogoliubov transformation is here written in terms of a unitary operator,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>, and an expression for that operator is found via the generating function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F=i</em> In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U.</em> The properties of the representation obtained by making<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> act upon the state vector ❘Ψ〉, to give a new state ❘Ψ<sub>U</sub>〉, are discussed. It is shown that the particle-number operator remains constant in such a picture so that the evolution of the system with time is clearly seen to depend upon the energy ω<sub>k</sub> on the one hand, and upon the state vector ❘Ψ<sub>U</sub>〉 on the other. Also, it is pointed out that this new representation permits the “in” and “out” states to be defined unambiguously.
We continue the calculation begun in Part I of hydrodynamic equations in general relativity according to Fillers' suggested modification of the iteration scheme of Anderson and DeCanio. We carry out this calculation far enough into the third and fourth iterations to obtain two principal results: First, we obtain a Newtonian-like force equation which is manifestly finite through the leading term of the radiation-reaction force (the 21/2 post-Newtonian approximation). Going beyond the 21/2 PNA, we find, and explicitly present, divergent terms which cannot be canceled out within this scheme. The implications of these results are discussed.
In this communication, the mutual connections between quantities that are generalizations of the notion of a Killing vector field are investigated. A classification of these quantities in terms of a complex vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em><sub>a</sub> is given. A common feature of all these quantities is that they imply the existence of a pair of shearfree geodetic null congruences. There are no explicit restrictions posed on the Ricci tensor.
It is shown that there are six, and only six, Robertson-Walker metrics which can be expressed in static form. They are precisely those Robertson-Walker metrics whose<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">spacetime</em> curvature is constant. The coordinate transformations which transform these metrics into their static form are also given. An error in Robertson and Noonan's Book [1] is pointed out and corrected.
A study is made on the connection between the existence of a Killing vector whose associated bivector (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ka;b</em>) is null and the Petrov type. A theorem of Debney is refined. Also considered is a particular case (omitted in Debney's papers) in which the bivector is nonnull.
The motion of test particles in the field of a plane gravitational wave is studied in order to derive some general properties of such motion, especially the possibilities of repeated meetings of two inertially moving particles.
Linearized theory of gravity is quantized both in a naive way and as a proper limit of the Dirac-Wheeler-De Witt approach to the quantization of the full theory. The equivalence between the two approaches is established. The problem of scattering in the canonically quantized theory of gravitation is investigated. The concept of the background metric naturally appears in the canonical formalism for this case. The equivalence between canonical and path-integral approaches is established for the problem of scattering. Some kinematical properties of functionals in Wheeler superspace are studied in an appendix.
The familiar Newman-Penrose formalism, in which the curvature of space-time is represented in terms of spin coefficients, is here extended to include the possibility of an asymmetric connection. It is hoped that this approach will be useful in dealing with certain problems in Einstein-Cartan theory, and also in other theories of gravitation that include torsion.
Using the null bivector approach, Petrov classification is studied for axisymmetric vacuum space-times with orthogonally transitive Killing vectors. It is shown that the equation on which the classification is based is biquadratic. This excludes that any such space-time can be type III. The only type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> manifolds are the radiative solutions considered by Hoffman. Van Stockum solutions are the most general type-II solutions. Degenerate Weyl solutions and Kinnersley solutions cover type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>. Stationary solutions with functional dependence of the potential are then examined. It is found that, except for special cases, Papapetrou and Lewis solutions are algebraically general.
The causes of the divergent integrals arising in slow-motion expansions of the general relativistic field equations are studied and a remedy for them is suggested. This is done within the context of a model problem involving a coupled nonlinear scalar field and isotropic oscillator. The model is shown to give rise to divergent integrals directly attributable to the nonlinearity when the field is assumed to be analytic in a slowness parameter. Application of a nonregular perturbation approach which includes the method of matched asymptotic expansions is shown to eliminate the infinite contributions.
Global rotation in cosmological models is defined on an observational basis. A theorem is proved saying that, for rigid motion, the global rotation is equal to the ordinary local vorticity. The global rotation is calculated in the space-time homogeneous class III models, with Gödel's model as a special case. It is shown that, with the exception of Gödel's model, the rotation in these models becomes infinite for finite affine parameter values. In some directions the rotation changes sign and becomes infinite in a direction opposite to the local vorticity. The points of infinite rotation are identified as conjugate points along the null geodesies. The physical interpretation of the infinite rotation is discussed, and a comparison with the behavior of the area distance at conjugate points is given.
An approximation scheme, analogous to ones previously considered for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström geometries, is applied to scalar waves in a Kerr geometry. Spectral curves of transmission coefficient for monochromatic, axially symmetric scalar waves imploding on a rotating black hole are calculated using the approximation scheme.

Exact solutions representing pp waves are found in a wide class of gauge theories of gravitation. Algebraic and symmetry properties are investigated and a special case of plane waves is discussed.
We review the solution to the equivalence problem in general relativity given by Cartan and Brans and present a practically useful method to obtain a coordinate-invariant description of a geometry. The method, which can be seen as a generalized Petrov classification, automatically gives the dimensions of the isometry group and its isotropy subgroup. Finally, we illustrate the method using the Schwarzschild solution as a very simple example.
The growth of magnetic energy density is considered in a collapsing ferrofluid with infinite electrical conductivity whose magnetic permeability is not a constant. It is shown that the variation of the magnetic permeability affects the growth of magnetic energy. The case of isotropic collapse and a specific case of anisotropic collapse are examined.
Some of the proposed Lagrangians and their corresponding field equations for a gravitational theory based on a Riemann-Cartan space with metric-compatible connection (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub>, theory) are compared and a new one is suggested. This Lagiangian, and that of P. von der Heyde and F. W. Hehl et al. are examined applying the “Gordon-decomposition” argument. Finally, Einstein's field equations with cosmological term are shown to be included in some sense, but the cosmological constant λ naturally has microphysical origin. To simplify notation, Cartan's calculus is used throughout.
We prove that the only Einstein spaces which admit a coordinate system with no ignorable coordinates which separates the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are certain symmetric spaces of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> due to Kasner and the constant-curvature de Sitter spaces.
An equation for the propagation of oscillations in a viscoelastic solid, induced by gravitational waves, is derived here. A linearized version of a relativistically invariant constitutive equation of integral type is employed in connection with the appropriately linearized field equations of general relativity. This theory could be applied for a more realistic design of gravitational wave detectors.
A theorem due to Brinkman states that, given a solution of the vacuum general relativistic field equations, it is never possible to generate a further solution by means of a nontrivial conformal transformation. It is pointed out here that there are exceptions to this result. The discussion is then extended to the nonsymmetric unified field theory, and the circumstances under which this theory admits a rigidly valid analog of Brinkman's theorem are investigated.
Let ℜ be the set of all inner products with a given indefinite signature on a finite-dimensional vector space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V.</em> It is shown that any continuous pseudometric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> on ℜ which is “canonical,” i.e., invariant with respect to all automorphisms of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>, is of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d(g, h)</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> </sub>/υ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub>), where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">υ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> </sub>, υ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> denote the volume elements associated with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>, respectively, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> is a real-valued function; i.e., there are no nontrivial distance functions. This result shows that a reasonable distance function between metric fields on a manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> cannot be obtained in terms of canonical distances of the inner products induced in the tangent spaces. A similar result is proved even for uniform structures instead of pseudometrics.
Recent results concerning isometric embeddings of charged spherically symmetric space-times as algebraic 4-surfaces of a pseudo-Euclidean ℝ<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> are given. Several problems arising in algebraic isometric embeddings of space-times with horizons are analyzed by studying the Reissner-Nordström solution. The connection between the images of radial null geodesics and the possibility of extending the algebraic isometric embedding through a horizon is studied in detail.
We consider perfect fluid spatially homogeneous cosmological models. Starting with a new exact solution of Blanchi type VIII, we study generalizations which lead to new classes of exact solutions. These new solutions are discussed and classified in several ways. In the original type VIII solution, the ratio of matter shear to expansion is constant, and we present a theorem which delimits those space-times for which this condition holds.
The first theorem states that all flat space-time gravitational theories must have a Lagrangian with a first term that is an homogeneous (degree-1) function of the 4-velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>, plus a functional of η<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup>. The second theorem states that all gravitational theories, that satisfy the strong equivalence principle have a Lagrangian with a first term<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup> plus an irrelevant term. In both cases the theories must issue from a unique variational principle. Therefore, under this condition it is impossible to find a flat space-time theory that satisfies the strong equivalence principle.
A Hamiltonian theory of motion for particles with internal structure, based on a dynamical bracket algebra, serves to define a generalized phase space for axially symmetric particles. Hydrodynamics of a gas of particles are explored through Liouville's and Boltzmann's equations and the equilibrium distribution function is obtained. Some modification of the pressure and density are necessary because of the spin and for a cold Fermi gas in thermal equilibrium they are shown explicitly.
We develop here a new unified theory of the electromagnetic and gravitational field, based on a six-dimensional generalization of Maxwell's equations; additional space-time coordinates are interpreted only as mathematical tools in order to obtain a linear realization of the four-dimensional conformal group.
The complete set of vacuum solutions for the metric tensor of a static spherically symmetric field is given, some of these solutions showing the remarkable feature of not agreeing-even in first order-with the classically well-known weak-field solutions of the Brans-Dicke (B.D.) equations. The existence of a particular two-parameter family of solutions raises severe doubts about the so-called Machian aspect of B.D. theory.
We present some new identities satisfied by double and triple products of the Weyl tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em><sub>αβμv</sub> and its dual<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathop W\limits^* _{\alpha \beta \mu v} \)</span>.
We look in detail at those effects which slow down black holes of mass ∼10<sup>15</sup> g and affect their spatial distribution today. In particular we treat effects caused by the charge fluctuations of the hole which result from quantum-mechanical processes. The dominant energyloss mechanism for the holes is the expansion of the universe, which leaves them virtually at rest at the time of galaxy formation. The resultant violent relaxation should concentrate roughly half of them in present-day galaxies and their halos.
It is well known that the interior and exterior Schwarzschild solutions are of different conformal type. More examples of this phenomenon are easily found in the literature. A precise statement of this phenomenon is given together with a theorem stating that this will take place if the matter tensor of the interior solution satisfies some weak energy conditions and if some reasonable conditions are fulfilled.
By means of a covariant formulation of Newton's theory of gravitation Newtonian analogs of Szekeres' space-times are found. The subsequent discussion illustrates a result of Bonnor.
The form of “gravitation”'s law in “projective relativity” is examined, based on a suitable generalization of Poisson's equation in de Sitter space-time; it is found that, in the interior case, a small difference with the customary Newtonian law arises. This difference, of a repulsive character, can be very important in cosmological problems.
In order to facilitate study of the difference between asymptotically flat and nonasymptotically flat boundary conditions on “Machian effects,” I study a rotating shell of perfect fluid separating a Minkowski interior from a closed Friedman-Robertson-Walker exterior. The shell is comoving with the dust in the exterior region, therefore it is observed to be expanding or collapsing relative to the Minkowski interior. Treating the rotation as a firstorder perturbation, I derive the time and spatial dependence of a given rotational perturbation and how it compares to analogous computations for asymptotically flat configurations. An extension of Bardeen's definition of the locally nonrotating observer is proposed for this nonstationary situation.
It is shown that the stationary cylindrically symmetric solution of Einstein's field equations as given recently by Vishveshwara and Hoenselaers [1] is identical with the well-known Gödel solution.
Using the method of Carnot cycles, we show that a rigidly moving fluid in thermal equilibrium is isometric.
By means of the principle of equivalence we deduce the qualitative behavior of the Schwarzschild horizon about a uniformly accelerating particle. This result is confirmed for an exact solution of a uniformly accelerating object in the limit of small accelerations. For large accelerations the Schwarzschild horizon appears to violate the qualitative behavior established via the principle of equivalence. When similar arguments are extended to an observable such as the red shift between two observers, there is no departure from the results expected from the principle of equivalence. The resolution of the paradox is brought about by a compensating effect due to the Rindler horizon.
It is shown that the vanishing of the electric field is not essential for the electric current to be finite in the latter stages of a collapsing hydromagnetic configuration in the limit of an infinite electrical conductivity. An electric counterpart of Ferraro's law of isorotation is obtained and its implication is briefly discussed in the case of pulsars.
We adapt the post-Newtonian gravitational-radiation methods developed within general relativity by Epstein and Wagoner to the gravitation theory with torsion, recently proposed by Hehl et al., and show that the two theories predict in this approximation the same gravitational radiation losses. Since they agree also on the first post-Newtonian level, they are at the present time-observationally-indistinguishable.
A coordinate-invariant description of a Riemannian manifold is known to be furnished by the curvature tensor and a finite number of its covariant derivatives relative to a field of orthogonal frames. These tensors are closer to measurements than the metrical tensor is. The present article discusses this description's usefulness in general relativity and the redundancy among the curvature tensor and its derivatives.
A paper by Hiscock [1] implies that the cosmic censorship hypothesis is false. It is shown here that this result is not proven and, indeed, is probably wrong.
We have developed elsewhere (cf. [1]) a method, which we call “asymptotic regularizations,” designed to give shock and infinitesimal shock wave equations for systems of partial differential equations. What we intend to do here is to illustrate its usefulness when applied to a specific system of partial differential equations, namely, that of noninductive, heatcurrent-free perfect relativistic fluids.
The Bäcklund transformations of the self-dual Yang-Mills fields are used to derive exact solutions of the stationary axially symmetric Einstein equations. Three solutions which belong to an infinite series of such solutions are explicitly calculated, the first of which is the Lewis solution. Also the first of another infinite series of solutions is calculated, which for some value of a parameter becomes the Papapetrou solution.
Any stationary, asymptotically flat solution to Einstein's equation is shown to asymptotically approach the Kerr solution in a precise sense. As an application of this result we prove a technical lemma on the existence of harmonic coordinates near infinity.
Wavelike perturbations of a system consisting of a gravitational and an electromagnetic field and a dust with a small ionized component are studied. By using the spin coefficient formalism we expand the perturbations of the various quantities characterizing the system into asymptotic series. The whole dynamics of high-frequency waves is shown to be governed by four propagation equations for the expansion coefficients of the tetrad components<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\hat \psi _4\)</span> and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\hat \phi _2\)</span> of perturbations of the Weyl tensor and Maxwell tensor in each order of the expansion. The perturbations of all the other variables can be derived without integration. The propagation equations are explicitly derived and discussed in the zeroth-order (geometrical optics) and in the first-order approximation. The influence of dust and plasma on the propagation is considered in the first-order equations.
Following the analyses of B. Carter and J. V. Narlikar, the nature of the incomplete, spacelike trajectories about a charged, rotating black hole is described. The study concentrates on those paths which a charged tachyon would follow, incident from off the equatorial plane (on which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ=π</em>/2). The effect of the absorption upon the black hole is calculated and it is concluded that for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em><sub>i</sub> ≠<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π/</em>2 only certain charged tachyons will reduce its entropy. However, a sustained bombardment by such particles could cause the singularity to be exposed.
A simple kinetic model of dipole particles moving in gravitational and electromagnetic fields is considered. Conservation of phase volume is proved. For stationary fields approximate expressions for the macroscopic energy-momentum and spin tensor of the system are obtained.
The spin-two particle is described by a symmetric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μυ</em> </sub> subject to the subsidiary conditions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>α</sub> <sup>α</sup> </span>=∂<sub>α</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sup>αβ</sup>=0. Their covariant generalization and the “wave equation” have been obtained directly from the Eulerian variational equations by algebraic methods only.

Motivated by a reexamination of Faraday's conjectures and experiments on electrogravitational induction of 130 years ago, a new experimental approach to the exploration of such hypothetical coupling is suggested. It consists of sharply accelerating a metal sample with a mass of the order of 10<sup>3</sup> g and checking to see if a transient “effective” electric charge is induced in the sample during the acceleration-as is expected on the basis of the Faraday electrogravitational induction hypothesis. Apparatus capable of discriminating electrogravitational induction effects to several orders of magnitude greater accuracy than hitherto achieved is described. The results of such an experiment, in which signals conforming to expectation are obtained, are reported. Tests that appear to rule out conventional charge generation mechanisms as the source of the observed signals are considered. Several other experiments where one might expect electrogravitational induction effects to manifest themselves, especially in the muon magnetic moment, are considered.

We describe an experiment which establishes, with a high degree of confidence, the existence of gravitational radiation as predicted by general relativity. The experiment involves observations of binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16, measurements of which now reveal a rate of change of orbital period within about 15% of that predicted by the general relativistic “quadrupole formula.” We show that the gravitation theories of Rosen, Ni, and Lightman-Lee predict an orbital period<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">increase</em>, regardless of the relative masses of the pulsar and its (assumed compact) companion. The Brans-Dicke theory predicts a much more rapid period decrease than does general relativity, unless the masses and internal structures of the two bodies are very similar. Thus, in the absence of additional<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> assumptions, general relativity is the only well-studied theory of gravity consistent with our data.
It is shown that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> space associated with a solution<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> of the Einstein-Maxwell equations can be endowed with a self-dual Maxwell field which arises from the radiation component of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>'s Maxwell field.
In the general theory of relativity the energy-momentum tensor due to an electromagnetic field is taken to be a symmetric rank-two tensor concomitant of a bivector and the metric tensor. As a step in the discussion of the possible uniqueness of this tensor we display a method for finding all tensor concomitants of a bivector and a metric in a space-time manifold.
We examine the three sets of junction conditions commonly used in general relativity: those due to Darmois, to O'Brien and Synge, and to Lichnerowicz. We show that those due to Darmois and Lichnerowicz are equivalent. The O'Brien and Synge set is stronger than the other two and is unsatisfactory in that it may rule out physically plausible junctions. We conclude that the Darmois set is the most convenient and reliable.
Every nonsimple<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> manifold is a radiative manifold. The Einstein's equations are solved for empty nonsimple<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> manifolds.
A general theory of gravitation is constructed using a tetrad and a scalar field. The resulting theory, called a scalar-tetrad theory, does not contain Einstein's or the Brans-Dicke theories as special cases. However, there is a range of scalar-tetrad theories with the same post-Newtonian limit as Einstein's theory. Two particular models are interesting because of their simplicity.
We study the stationary and axisymmetric flow of a perfect fluid accreted by a Kerr black hole. The equations for the flow lines are obtained. Explicit solutions are found in the case when the fluid has an equation of state pressure = energy density.
This paper is meant to announce the appearance of a new computer program for symbolic calculations in general relativity, named ORTOCARTAN. The program calculates the curvature quantities from an orthonormal tetrad of forms representing the metric, both the tetrad and the coordinate components. The paper describes the main features of the program's input and output, and compares the program's speed to a few general-purpose systems, notably LAM, ALTRAN, FORMAC, REDUCE, and SYMBAL. A general overview of technical parameters of the program, and conceptual features of the algorithm is given.
Couch and Torrence suggest that the vacuum Einstein equations admit a larger class of asymptotically flat solutions than those exhibiting the peeling property. Starting with the assumption that<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\Psi _0 = O(r^{ - 2 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span>, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d/dr</em>)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\Psi _0 = O(r^{ - 3 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span> and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ/δx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\Psi _1 = O(r^{ - 2 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> = 2, 3) are angular coordinates, they show that<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\Psi _1 = O(r^{ - 2 - \varepsilon _1 } )\)</span>, where ε<sub>1</sub>⩽ 2 and ε<sub>1</sub>&lt;ε<sub>0</sub>;<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE5">\(&lt; \varepsilon _0 ;\Psi _2 = O(r^{ - 2 - \varepsilon _2 } )\)</span>, where ε<sub>2</sub> ⩽ 1 and ε<sub>1</sub>&lt; ε<sub>1</sub>; and Ψ<sub>4</sub> and Ψ<sub>3</sub> peel as they would under the stronger peeling conditions. The Winicour-Tamburino energy-momentun and angular momentum integrals for these solutions, in general, diverge. In fact, since Couch and Torrence determine only the radial dependence of the solution, it is not clear that the solutions are well defined. We find that the stronger assumption<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE6">\(\Psi _0 = O(r^{ - 3 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span>, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d/dr</em>)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE7">\(\Psi _0 = O(r^{ - 4 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span>, and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ/δx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE8">\(\Psi _0 = O(r^{ - 3 - \varepsilon _0 } )\)</span> does result in well-defined solutions for which both the energy-momentum and angular momentum intergrals are not only finite but result in the same expressions as are obtained for peeling space-times. This assumption appears to be the minimal assumption that is necessary for investigating outgoing radiation at null infinity.
Relic neutrinos produced during the early evolution of the universe will be abundant today (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub>≈<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sub>γ</sub>) and, if they have a small mass (3 &lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> &lt; 10 eV), may supply the dominant contribution to the total mass density. We review the data on the mass on various scales galaxies, binaries, small groups, large clusters) and conclude that ordinary matter (nucleons) is capable of accounting for the inferred mass on all scales except that of clusters of galaxies. Were the mass in clusters mainly in nucleons, too much helium and too little deuterium would have been produced during primordial nucleosynthesis. Relic neutrinos with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> &gt; 3 eV are heavy enough to collapse into clusters of galaxies; for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> &lt; 10 eV they are too light to collapse along with binaries and small groups. Such neutrinos would supply the dominant contribution to the mass in the universe.
The null geodesic equation is solved for the ℋ space of Sparling and Tod. Bondi coordinates are found and it is verified that the ℋ space construction is idempotent, i.e., the ℋ-space of this ℋ space is itself, symbolically ℋ<sup>2</sup> = ℋ. Properties of the solution are used to motivate a definition of asymptotic flatness.
By assuming that Maxwell's electromagnetic field equations are valid in a Riemann-Cartan space-time and by using a set of rules to transform from Riemannian kinematics to Riemann-Cartan kinematics, the kinematic aspects of magnetohydrodynamics in a Riemann-Cartan space-time are examined. If the electric conductivity of the fluid is infinite, then the magnetic field conservation laws still hold, but torsion affects the physical interpretation of the equation for proper charge density. A result, based on the Ricci identity for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub> and the first Bianchi identity, and describing differential rotation of a charged fluid in a Riemann space-time, is extended to a Riemann-Cartan space-time. The kinematic role played by torsion in this result is examined.
Solutions of Einstein's equations which describe isolated scattering systems are discussed and a set of asymptotic boundary conditions, which appear to characterize such solutions, is proposed. These conditions are then used to obtain a canonical definition of the total amount of angular momentum radiated by such a system.
This paper reviews the recent progress in the nonsymmetric unified field theory of Einstein and Straus and its current status as a theory of macrophysics of gravitation and electromagnetism.
Within the framework of differential geometry, Yang's parallel-displacement gauge theory is considered with respect to “pure” gravitational fields. In a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">four</em>-dimensional Riemannian manifold it is shown that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">double self-dual</em> solutions obey Einstein's vacuum equations with the cosmological term, whereas the double<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">anti</em>-self-dual configurations satisfy the Rainich conditions of Wheeler's<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">geometrodynamics.</em> Conformal methods reveal that the gravitational analog of the “instanton” or pseudoparticle solution of Yang-Mills theory was already known to Riemann.



Soliton physics has made considerable progress in solving nonlinear problems. This paper is meant to relate the soliten concept to the stationary axisymmetric vacuum fields in general relativity. We present a functional transformation which, working as a nonlinear creation operator, generates gravitational fields of isolated sources. When applied to flat space-time (“gravitational vacuum”) this operation leads to a nonlinear superposition of an arbitrary number of Kerr particles. This superposition also includes the Tomimatsu-Sato fields. The functional transformations form an infinite-parameter group which contains the Kinnersley-Geroch group as a subgroup.
We present the result of an experiment of the Florence group which has detected a quadrupole anisotropy in the cosmic background radiation. We show that this result implies that the universe either has large metric perturbations outside the particle horizon, or will become largely irregular in the future.
The general solution of the weak field equations of the nonsymmetric unified field theory in the magnetic case is reduced to the solution of a second-order differential equation with movable critical points. Some special solutions are discussed.
It is shown that the foliation of a space-time manifold of codimension 2 provides a basis for the study of the deformation of magnetic field lines. It is found that the fluid flow vector and the curvature vector of a nongeodesic “stiff” magnetic field line are always orthogonal. Further, it is shown that the metric tensor of the 2-space orthogonal to the “Maxwellian string” is Lie-transported along the magnetic field lines when the magnetic field lines are “stiff.” If there exists a spacelike Killing vector field parallel to the magnetic field, then the magnetic field lines must be “stiff.
The spin-coefficient formalism presented elsewhere is here applied to classical neutrino fields in Einstein-Cartan theory. It is shown that the neutrino current vector is tangent to an expansion-free null geodesic congruence with constant and equal twist and shear, which vanish if and only if the congruence is a repeated principal null congruence of the gravitational field. The geodesics are both extremals and autoparallels. All exact solutions for the case of pure radiation fields are obtained, and it is shown that the only possible ghost solutions have a plane wave metric.
Let (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) be a Lorentzian warped product space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>=(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a, b</em>)×H, g = −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup> ⊕<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">fh</em>, where −∞⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>&lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>⩽+∞, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H, h</em>) is a Riemannian manifold and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>: (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a, b</em>)→(0, ∞) is a smooth function. We show that if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>&gt;−∞ and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H, h</em>) is homogeneous, then the past incompleteness of every timelike geodesic of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M,g</em>) is stable under small<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>0</sup> perturbations in the space Lor(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>) of Lorentzian metrics for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. Also we show that if (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H,h</em>) is isotropic and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M,g</em>) contains a past-inextendible, past-incomplete null geodesic, then the past incompleteness of all null geodesics is stable under small<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>1</sup> perturbations in Lor(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>). Given either the isotropy or homogeneity of the Riemannian factor, the background space-time (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M,g</em>) is globally hyperbolic. The results of this paper, in particular, answer a question raised by D. Lerner for big bang Robertson-Walker cosmological models affirmatively.
Results are established concerning perturbations of each empty Robertson-Walker space-time (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) with a nonvanishing cosmological constant. The perturbed space-times have the general form (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathop {M,}\limits^ \sim \mathop g\limits^ \sim \)</span>) with<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(M\)</span> an extension of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(g\)</span> lying in an open neighborhood of g in a type of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sup> topology. These results indicate that large classes of such perturbations give rise to space-times which suffer from one of two types of incompleteness.
It is shown that any symmetric tensor density of covariant rank 2 which is divergence-free and is a concomitant of the metric tensor, a vector field, and their first and second derivatives will be entirely independent of the vector field. From this we show that there is no suitable generalization of the Huggins term for the theory of general relativity.
Starting with a few basic assumptions on the local asymptotic behavior of space-time and using Penrose's conformal technique the asymptotic behavior of both the physical and unphysical metric is obtained in a Bondi-type coordinate system. The space-times under consideration are not necessarily empty in the asymptotic region nor are they necessarily asymptotically flat. However, they do have the usual “falloff” behavior as one goes out toward infinity in a given null direction. The assumptions made in this paper and the resultant metrics are compared with those of Persides in his recent paper on the definition of asymptotic flatness.

The Kostant-Souriau method of geometric quantization is applied to homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with positive intrinsic curvature and a massless Klein-Gordon scalar field. These models are studied because classically they collapse to a singularity. It is rigorously shown that the quantized models collapse as well (so that there is no “quantum bounce”). This work demonstrates the practical usefulness of geometric quantization for the study of physical systems.
A one-electron atom is considered in a general curved space-time. The Hamiltonian of the Dirac equation is written in Fermi normal coordinates, including all interaction terms of first order in the Riemann tensor of the space-time. Expressions are obtained for the shifts in various atomic energy levels caused by the curvature. There is a possibility that these shifts would be observable in the spectrum of hydrogen falling into small black holes (radius about 10<sup>−3</sup> cm) left over from the early universe.
A geometrical gravitational theory based on the connection Γ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">βγ</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> </sup> </span>={<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">βγ</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> </sup> </span>} + δ<span class="Stack"> <sub>β</sub> <sup>α</sup> </span>∂<sub>γ</sub> ln<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> + δ<span class="Stack"> <sub>γ</sub> <sup>α</sup> </span>∂<sub>β</sub> ln<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>βγ</sub>∂<sup>α</sup> ln ψ is developed. The field equations for the new theory are uniquely determined apart from one unknown dimensionless parameter Ω<sub>2</sub>. The geometry on which our theory is based is an extension of the Weyl geometry, and by the extension the gravitational coupling constant and the gravitational mass are made to be dynamical and geometrical. The fundamental geometrical objects in the theory are a metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> and two gauge scalars<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>. Physically the gravitational potential corresponds to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> in the same way as in general relativity, the gravitational coupling constant to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em><sup>−2</sup>, and the gravitational mass to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u(ϕ, ψ)</em>, which is a coscalar of power −1 algebraically made of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>. The theory satisfies the weak equivalence principle, but breaks the strong one generally. We shall find out<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u(ϕ, ψ)=ϕ</em> on the assumption that the strong one keeps holding good at least for bosons of low spins. Thus we have the simple correspondence between the geometrical objects and the gravitational objects. Since the theory satisfies the weak one, the inertial mass is also dynamical and geometrical in the same way as is the gravitational mass. Moreover, the cosmological term in the theory is a coscalar of power −4 algebraically made of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u(ϕ, ψ)</em>, so it is dynamical, too. Finally we give spherically symmetric exact solutions. The permissible range of the unknown parameter Ω<sub>2</sub> is experimentally determined by applying the solutions to the solar system.

A method is developed for tracing geodesics of particles and light rays through Regge calculus space-times. In the flat interiors of the blocks, the geodesics are straight lines, and at the boundaries between blocks they are refracted according to an “extremal distance” law. The method is then tested for the Regge calculus version of the Schwarzschild space-time. For radial motion, it gives good agreement with the analytic solution, provided the blocks are sufficiently small. Exactly circular orbits are impossible in Regge calculus, but it is shown how to construct “approximately circular” ones. These examples are in preparation for an investigation of more general orbits and more general space-times, using Regge calculus.
Synge's [4] approximation method is developed to include the lowest-order radiation terms in the equations of motion. The method applies to systems which have been stationary at some finite time in the past, this restriction being necessary in order to ensure convergence of the integrals occurring in the higher orders of approximation. The results obtained are then compared with those of Chandrasekhar and Esposito [7] and of Anderson and Decanio [8].
A black hole is interpreted as an “open system” in the Prigogine sense. From the point of view of spin transformations, the existence of a phase transition corresponding to an extreme Kerr hole is recognized. The role played by the spin entropy into superradiance of a rotating black hole is investigated.
We consider the Killing-Yano equation by dropping the antisymmetry hypothesis and studying some consequences of the integrability conditions. We find that the cases of interest are more general, and we discuss the relevance of solutions to the construction of Killing tensors.
Singularities in vacuum spatially homogeneous cosmological models are investigated. It is shown that in general the curvature scalar<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>*</sub> <sup>abcd</sup> </span>R<sup>*abcd</sup>diverge and that the only solutions which have curvature singularities at which this scalar does not diverge describe certain plane-wave space-times. It is argued that with matter present these nonscalar singularities are even less likely to occur. The exceptional case of Bianchi type VI<sub>−1/9</sub> is not considered.
Equations are derived giving the null geodesics in any left-flat space as the intersection of hypersurfaces. The connection with null geodesics given in terms of the good-cut functions for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> spaces is established.
An effective metric is defined and used for analyzing the quantum fluctuations in a classical geometry. Earlier work showing that quantum (conformal) fluctuations avoid the classical singularity in the case of spherically symmetric collapse is briefly reviewed. It is shown that this result does<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> extend to anisotropic Bianchi type I cosmology. Here the dispersion in the fluctuations increases too slowly to quench the classical singularity. The singularity persists in the space-time described by the effective metric.
The question is asked: what space curvature would a fundamental observer in an ideal Robertson-Walker universe obtain by direct local spatial measurements, i.e., without reference to the motion pattern of the other galaxies? The answer is that he obtains the curvature<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> of his “private” space generated by all the geodesics orthogonal to his world line at the moment in question, and that ∼<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> is related to the usual curvature<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K=k/R</em><sup>2</sup> of the “public” space of galaxies by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K=K+H</em><sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> is Hubble's parameter.
There are now many theories of gravity with a torsion field as well as the usual metric field. One of the arguments for allowing torsion is based upon a gauge theory analogy. The purpose of this paper is to clarify exactly which symmetries are being gauged in this process. The principal observation is that special relativity is invariant under two different kinds of Lorentz transformations. The first type rotate the fields and move them from one point to another in space-time. The second type merely rotate the fields at each point without changing their location. To gauge both types of rotations requires a torsion field as well as a metric field.
We present the results of a systematic study of the dynamics of realistic binary systems in the post-Newtonian approximation (PNA) of general relativity. We propose definitions valid in the PNA for the self-angular-momenta of the binary's members, as well as for the angular momentum of their relative orbital motion, and we examine under which conditions they can be considered as constant in the PNA. This enables us to define to the same approximation the plane relative orbital motion. Then we find the form of the differential equations of motion from an integration of which we prove that in the PNA the relative motion is a processing ellipse composed of a basic orbit and a correction, both of which are of post-Newtonian character. Moreover, using the polar equation of the above ellipse we define the elements of the post-Newtonian, relative, basic orbit, we generalize to the PNA the three well-known laws of classical celestial mechanics of Kepler, and we derive the precessional motion of the relative orbit's pericenter. Finally, we compare our method with other methods existing in the literature, and we expose its theoretical and conceptual differences with them.
We complete the theoretical framework initiated in an earlier paper for the post-Newtonian dynamical description of realistic binary stars. We evaluate the absolute orbits of the members, the corresponding orbital elements and apsidal motions, and generalize the concept of the classical mass function. Moreover we propose star models expressing the inertial mass of a star in terms of its rest mass. So the rest mass, which for stars of equal inertial masses depends on the star's nature, can in principle be determined from the observational data concerning the inertial masses. An application to the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 shows that the star models proposed are quite satisfactory for distinguishing the rest from the inertial masses with the present accuracy of the observational data.
One of the postulates of the Kaluza-Klein theory is that the lines representing events should be geodesics. Recently a claim has been made that in the Jordan-Thiry version of the theory, this is not only unnecessary, but in fact contradicts experiment. It is the purpose of the present note to show that this conclusion is in error and to point out an undesirable feature of the entire Jordan-Thiry procedure.
The choice between the Kaluza-Klein and the Jordan-Thiry forms of five-dimensional unified field theory has been considered by McInnes. Here a reply is made to criticisms by McInnes of a previous paper. In addition, the implications of projective relativity are considered.
A one-parameter family of type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> left-flat spaces is given and the parameterized family of totally null two-surfaces is used to generate a good-cut function which is of the Sparling class. Generalizations are then presented.
A 3-manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is said to have ends if the complement of a compact set in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the finite disjoint union of sets diffeomorphic to the exterior of a sphere in ℝ<sup>3</sup>. This paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for when an asymptotically flat initial data set (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\bar g, \bar \pi , \bar v, \bar T\)</span>) on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is determined by a set of freely specifiable York data.
The concept of bimetric Killing vectors is introduced. The set of these vectors allows one to define global mechanical integrals for matter and field separately, and to get conservation laws for the matter quantities and generation laws for the field quantities. It is possible to predict what physical spaces of high mobility are contained in a certain variant of a bimetric theory. The procedure is developed in the framework of Rosen's bimetric theories of gravitation, but it may be applied to a wide class of bimetric theories.
An integral representation for the inverses of the differential operators called edth is given in the two cases of particular interest. This operator plays a large role in the study of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> spaces and of self-dual solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations in the asymptotic domain.
The boundary terms in the action for Regge's formulation of general relativity on a simplicial net are derived and compared with the boundary terms in continuum general relativity.
We prove that in the context of the first post-Newtonian perfect fluid theory it is possible to express the far-field metric tensor of an arbitrary perfect-fluid source in terms of parameters, which are known as three-dimensional volume integrals over the source's interior. Such a description for an arbitrary source is not known in the context of the exacty theory of gravity. It seems that the approximate description presented here is the only and the more general one valid consistently to the post-Newtonian approximation.
Two methods axe considered to “tap” the earths' rotational energy. This ancient “collapsed gravitational energy” exceeds the earth-lunar binding energy. One involves an orbiting “electromagnetic-gravitational” coupling system whereby the earth's rotation, with its nonuniform mass distribution, first uses gravity to add orbital energy to a satellite, similar to a planetary “flyby.rd The second stage involves enhanced satellite “drag” as current-carrying coils withdraw the added orbital energy as they pass through the earth's nonuniform magnetic field. A second more direct method couples the earth's rotational motion using conducting wires moving through the noncorotating part (ionospheric current systems) of the geomagnetic field. These methods, although not immediately feasible, are considerably more efficient than using pure gravitational coupling to earth-moon tides.
This paper defines mass, momentum, and energy densities for a perfect fluid, and derives a coordinate-dependent 3+1 decomposition of the equation of motion in terms of a scalar potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ ≡ c</em><sup>2</sup> [(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>44</sub>) 1/2 −1] and a vector potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> ≡<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cg</em><sub>4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em></sub>/(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>. The momentum equation has the form of the Euler equation except there is an additional force proportional to the vector potential and the rate of change of kinetic energy per unit volume. The momentum and energy equations are integrated to obtain the equations previously derived for a particle. The momentum equation is solved for the total acceleration of a fluid element. The equations are exact and do not depend on the choice of coordinate system.
Solutions to the Stephenson-Yang theory of gravity and its generalizations are discussed. By considering the inclusion of a cosmological term in the action spherically symmetric static solutions are presented that do not fall into the vacuum Einstein class. A simple double-duality ansatz is responsible for all the solutions that are discussed.
The gravitational lens effects associated with a transparent mass distribution are quite different from those of the well-known opaque sphere. We have shown that any spherical galaxy whose mass distribution, when projected onto the plane of the sky, decreases outward from the center of the galaxy and diverges less rapidly than 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>→0, must always produce an odd number of images, usually one or three, of a source located behind the galaxy. Using optical scalar techniques, the amplification of each image can readily be obtained. For a given source and galaxy, we can define a dimensionless focal length, a function of impact parameter, and a dimensionless distance factor, depending on lens parameters and source distance. The central value of the ratio of these quantities determines the multiplicity of the images. The mass distribution of the galaxy is a crucial function, and we show in some detail how this affects the various focal lengths.
The gravitational field of a charged particle is investigated on the basis of the bimetric general relativity theory. It is found that the field differs from the Reissner-Nordström field only very close to the sphere<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R=m</em>+(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup> −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>. This sphere is impenetrable, and its interior is unphysical.
A number of experiments show that the decay lifetimes of muons bound to atomic nuclei are longer than the decay lifetimes of free muons. The special relativistic time dilation predicts decay lifetime dilations that are substantially smaller than the observed decay lifetime dilations. In this paper it is shown that adding a recently predicted electro-magnetic time dilation (analogous to the gravitational time dilation) to the special relativistic time dilation gives a total time dilation that agrees with the observed decay lifetime dilations.
The characteristic initial-value problem for the scalar wave equation in some spherically symmetrical geometries, including Reissner-Nordström exterior geometry, is considered. A modified Picard iteration making explicit use of the (known) static solutions yields a formula for the fields. The formulas extend in to the outer horizon, and from them are obtained useful expressions for the reflection and transmission amplitudes in terms of the static solutions.

The kinematics and dynamics of self-similar cosmological models are discussed. The degrees of freedom of the solutions of Einstein's equations for different types of models are listed. The relation between kinematic quantities and the classifications of the self-similarity group is examined. All dust local rotational symmetry models have been found.
We give here a first example of the usefulness of a method which we developed elsewhere, showing how it can give infinitesimal shock wave equations from a differential system when distribution methods fail to do so. The fluid chosen is the one indicated in the title, and the method proves to be particularly useful and easy to apply when one comes to the determination of the propagation equations.
Using the technique of Padé (2, 2) approximant we present, in this paper, an approximate analytical solution to the field equations of general relativity for time-independent, spherically symmetric systems in which the pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> and density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> are related by a polytropic equation of state:<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P = Kρ</em><sup>1+1/n</sup>. The boundary values of coordinate radius ξ<sub>1</sub>, for polytropic indices<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 0, 1.0 (0.5) 3.0, are given in Table I. Table II contains the values of other physical parameters, ν(ξ<sub>1</sub>) (mass),<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\rho _c /\bar \rho \)</span> (the density concentration), and 2GM/c<sup>2</sup>R (the ratio of gravitational radius to the coordinate radius) for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 0 and 1.
A general technique is described for dealing with the quantum fluctuations between conformally flat space-times. The second part of the paper deals with the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown there that this space-time is stable against fluctuations of mass, but transitions between two space-times of different masses can be obtained via conformai fluctuations. Purely conformal fluctuations of the Schwarzschild metric are, however, damped at the event horizon. Similar conclusions are drawn about the Reissner-Nordstrom space-time.
By means of bimetric Killing vectors two spherically symmetric fields are investigated: (i) the time-dependent one in Rosen's flat-background bimetric theory; and (ii) the energy-preserving in Rosen's cosmological-background bimetric theory with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 1. In the first case a wave behavior of the field is present. In the second case a time evolution is obtained for fields, created by insular systems of constant energy. These phenomena are typical for bimetric theories of gravitation.
We generalize the newtonian expressions for the orbital angular momentum of a two-body system, and for the spin of each body, by introducing corresponding definitions in the post-Newtonian approximation of fully conservative theories of gravity. Using this definition of the spin and assuming that the bodies rotate rigidly and that the equations of motion are Hamiltonian, we show that in fully conservative theories of gravity the spin of each body undergoes a relativistic precession about the direction of the orbital angular momentum, as a consequence of the local equations of motion for a perfect fluid.
If we study the de Sitter universe in the geodetic representation, we obtain the “projective relativity,” valid on the cosmic scale, for hyperdense matter and high energies. The new theory can be applied also to quantum and elementary particle physics. In this work we examine the angular momentum operator, the D'Alembertian generalized equation, and study the electron, conceived as an oscillating microuniverse.
A generalization is given of some previous work in which a momentum space representation for the Feynman propagator,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G(x, y)</em>, of a scalar field in an arbitrary curved space-time was obtained. The points<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> are allowed to vary in a normal neighborhood of an arbitrary fixed point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> which is taken as an origin of normal coordinates and the representation is obtained by Fourier transformation in the coordinate difference<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>α</sup>-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em><sup>α</sup>. The generality of this representation enables it to be applied to the evaluation of the divergences in any Feynman graph. As an example, the third-order (two-loop) corrections to the four-point function of λø<sup>4</sup> field theory are shown to be renormalizable in curved space-time.


Linear and nonlinear perturbations of vacuum space-times are examined in the approximation of high frequencies. In order to do this, it is necessary to extend the concept of coordinate gauge transformations to the case of nonlinear terms. The generation of the second harmonic is studied by investigating perturbations of the tetrad components of the Weyl tensor. Propagation equations determining the amplitudes of these perturbations are derived. Finally, the relative motion in a system of test particles under the influence of both main wave and second harmonic as seen by a free falling observer is investigated. If inertial forces are absent, the second harmonic gives rise to oscillations in two transverse-traceless modes and in a transverse-scalar mode. The amplitude of the latter mode is proportional to the shear of the ray congruence along which the perturbations propagate.
A regular, localized solution of the classical theory of the gravitational field coupled to the electromagnetic field and to an auxiliary scalar field is presented, and an analytical form of this solution is obtained in a limiting case. This solution, which is interpreted, from the macroscopic point of view, as an extended charged particle, has a peculiar microscopic topology characterized by a fundamental length of the order of the classical electromagnetic radius of the particle. There is no lower limit to the mass-to-charge ratio of such a particle.
The classical theory of the gravitational field coupled to an SO(3) gauge field and to a ghost Higgs field in (3+1) dimensions is found to admit regular localized solutions of the electric or magnetic type. These solutions, which generalize solutions previously found for the Abelian case, are characterized by a non-Euclidean spatial topology, with two points at infinity.
We prove that the far-field metric tensor of an arbitrary, gravitating perfect-fluid source can describe the far-field Kerr metric consistently to the post-Newtonian approximation. A specific physical meaning is given to the system of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates by identifying its origin with the source's center of inertial mass, uniformly moving to post-Newtonian accuracy, and the radial coordinate with up to a known additive constant the isotropic, radial coordinate, measured from the center of inertial mass. The constants of the Kerr solution are identified with the source's inertial mass and angular momentum, known as three-dimensional volume integrals over the source's interior to post-Newtonian and Newtonian accuracy, respectively. It seems that the approximate description of the Kerr metric presented here is the only and the more general one valid consistently to the perfect-fluid first post-Newtonian approximation.
We calculate the radiation reaction force within the Anderson-Decanio scheme of a Post-Newtonian expansion of general relativity modified such that no infinite expressions appear up to the order considered. We show that for quasiperiodic motions of bodies in bound systems, i.e., motions which differ little from Keplerian motion, the dominant contribution to the change of the Newtonian energy of the system equals the power loss given by Einstein's “quadrupole formula.
We present a cosmological solution of the source-free Einstein-Maxwell equations with “stiff” matter and an electromagnetic null field, which is a locally rotationally symmetric tilted Bianchi type-V universe.
Retardation features of rigid motion, in flat two-dimensional space-time, are interpreted in terms of a consistent picture of signals. A similar analysis is adopted to effect a natural transition from rigid to nonrigid frames for which a degree of rigidity, having a simple physical meaning, can be defined.

We determine the conditions necessary for a solution of the supergravity field equations with infinitesimal spin-3/2 field to be a pure gauge transformation of an Einstein vacuum field. The analysis depends on the Petrov classification of the curvature tensor and uses two-component spinor calculus. For general type I, the type II, and type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>, the necessary conditions found are also shown to be sufficient, and the explicit form of the gauge transformation can be given.
Criteria for the existence and stability of circular orbits in a general stationary axisymmetric field are established using the equation of geodesic deviation. Circular orbits in the ReissnerNordström, Schwarzschild and Kerr fields, all with a positive cosmological constant “Λ” included, are considered and the effects of “Λ” are detailed.
A class of exact solutions-depending upon two dimensionless parameters-to the gravitational field equations is obtained, where the source of the field is a rotating, hollow cylinder of infinite length. The material properties, although highly idealised, nevertheless are not unrealistic and chosen in such a way as to allow elementary integration. The solutions show how the inertial frame inside the cylinder is dragged by the rotating material, and also how the drag continues inside the material and in the outside region. They are exact examples for the Lense-Thirring effect.
It has been shown that Reisner-Nordström singularities cannot be formed due to quantum radiation of scalar particles.
A previously studied Lorentz-covariant theory of gravitation is given in generally covariant form, i.e., the theory holds for arbitrary reference frames. Flat space-time is a natural condition for the conservation of energy and momentum. The energy-momentum tensor of matter and gravitation is the source of the gravitational field.
This paper is a first attempt to reconcile the two great concepts of twentieth century physics: Einstein's theory of general relativity, and Murphy's law.
The so-called “structural equations” for generalized Killing-Yano tensors are derived. The first set of integrability conditions for the structural equations are also obtained. Several consequences of the integrability conditions are then discussed. For instance, it is shown that the maximal number of generalized Killing-Yano tensors occurs in flat space.
We formulate two global existence conjectures for the Einstein equations and discuss their relevance to the cosmic censorship conjecture. We argue that the reformulation of the cosmic censorship conjecture as a global existence problem renders it more amenable to direct analytical attack. To demonstrate the facilty of this approach we prove the cosmological version of our global existence conjecture for the Gowdy spacetimes on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>3</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>.

The scalar and electromagnetic radiation emitted by relativistic particles moving along the stable nongeodesic trajectories in the Kerr gravitational field are described. Two particular models of the nongeodesic motion are developed involving a slightly charged rotating black hole and a rotating black hole immersed in an external magnetic field.
In globally hyperbolic space-times there is a finite upper bound on the proper time lengths of nonspacelike curves between two chronologically related events. We show that if global hyperbolicity is replaced by a weaker causality condition, then there can exist chronologically related events in the space-time such that the proper time lengths of nonspacelike curves joining them grow without bound. We also show that the existence of a finite upper bound on the lengths of nonspacelike curves between two chronologically related events implies only chronology of the space-time but not causality.
We consider a large class of geometric Lagrangian forms defined in the manifold δ of the reference frames. The theories described by those Lagrangians are such that, in an empty region, the manifold δ can be identified with one of the de Sitter groups. The Lagrangian forms are classified according to their symmetry properties with respect to transformation groups acting on the linear space of the infinitesimal transformations of the frames. Requiring invariance with respect to a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) group and a reasonable physical behavior under space reflections, we obtain only three different theories. Then we show that every Lagrangian form of the kind we are considering, is equivalent to an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3)-invariant one.
We define the Jaumann derivative of a tensor field in relativity by a formal generalization of a stress rate in viscoelasticity. A tensor field is said to be Jaumann transported iff its Jaumann derivative vanishes. It is found that the gravitational potentials are Jaumann transported identically. The concept of a “complete rotation tensor” has been introduced to study the Jaumann derivative with respect to a null vector field. This provides a characterization of the integrability of a hypersurface orthogonal congruence. A perfect fluid collapsing by neutrino emission and undergoing Jaumann transport with respect to the neutrino flow is found to be compatible with that of a catastrophic collapse. The circumstances leading to the existence of “ghost neutrinos” are cited. The degeneracy of the Kerr-Newman black hole into the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is expressed in terms of the Jaumann propagation.
In the framework of affine bundles we present gravity as an “internal” gauge field theory of the Poincaré group. The resulting geometry is a Riemann-Cartan space-time carrying torsion and curvature. In order to admit a nontrivial action of the translation group we formally extend the matter Lagrangian to affine field variables. Finally, we establish the relation of our approach with the formalism of Hehl et al.
Using a fast-motion approximation method we obtain the second-order gravitational field and equations of motion for two pointlike objects in algebraically closed form. A regularization procedure is used which is shown to guarantee the consistency of the approximation scheme. The equations of motion are then transformed within the framework of relativistic predictive mechanics into a system of ordinary differential equations.
In this paper we show that if Vaidya's radiation metric is considered from the point of view of kinetic theory in general relativity, the corresponding phase space distribution function can be generalized in a particular way. The new family of spherically symmetric radiation metrics obtained contains Vaidya's as a limiting situation. The Einstein field equations are solved in a “comoving” coordinate system. Two arbitrary functions of a single variable are introduced in the process of solving these equations. Particular examples considered are a stationary solution, a nonvacuum solution depending on a single parameter, and several limiting situations.
An exact solution of Einstein's perfect fluid field equations is presented. The Weyl tensor of this space-time is of Petrov type III.
When discussing spherically symmetric gravitational fields one usually assumes that the whole space-time is invariant under the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3) group of transformations. In this paper, the Einstein field equations are investigated under the weaker assumption that only the 3-spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=const are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3) symmetric. The following further assumptions are made: (1) The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> lines are orthogonal to the spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=const. (2) The source in the field equations in a perfect fluid, or dust, or the Λ term, or the empty space. (3) With respect to the center of symmetry the fluid source may move only radially if at all. Under these assumptions one solution with a perfect fluid source, found previously by Stephani, is recovered and interpreted geometrically, and it is shown that it is the sole solution which is not spherically symmetric in the traditional sense. The paper ends with a general discussion of cosmological models whose 3-spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=const are the same as in the Robertson-Walker models. No new solutions were explicitly found, but it is shown that such models exist in which the sign of curvature is not fixed in time.
We continue our investigation of a variational principle for general relativity in which the metric tensor and the (asymmetric) linear connection are varied independently. As in Part I, the matter Lagrangian is minimally coupled to the connection and the gravitational Lagrangian is taken to be the curvature scalar, but we now relax the Riemannian constraint as far as possible—that is, as far as the projective invariance of the assumed gravitational Lagrangian will allow. The outcome of this procedure is a gravitational theory formulated in a volume-preserving space-time (i.e., with torsion and tracefree nonmetricity). The vanishing of the trace of the nonmetricity is due to the remaining vector constraint. We also discuss the physical significance of the relaxation of the Riemannian constraint, the possible relaxation of the vector constraint, the notion of the hypermomentum current, and its possible relation to elementary particle physics.
A previously studied theory of gravitation in flat space-time [Petry, W. (1981).<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gen. Rel. Grav.</em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">13</strong>, 865] is applied to homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models. There exist two different classes of models without singularities: (i) ever-expanding models, (ii) oscillating models. The first class contains models with hot big bang. For these models we get at the beginning of the universe—in contrast to Einstein's theory—very high but finite densities of matter and radiation with a big bang of very short duration. After short time these models pass into the homogeneous and isotropic models of Einstein's theory with spatial curvature equal zero and cosmological constant Λ⩾0.
We present an analysis of the motion of test particles in Gödel's universe. Both geodesical and nongeodesical motions are considered; the accelerations for nongeodesical motions are given. Examples for closed timelike world lines are shown and the dynamical conditions for time travel in Gödel's space-time are discussed. It is shown that these conditions alone do not suffice to exclude time travel in Gödel's space-time.
The null geodesics are investigated in a class of open space-time homogeneous cosmological models with rotating sheared matter (Ozsváth class<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">III</strong>). Gödel's model is a special case. A stationary polar coordinate system is employed in which matter rotates rigidly. The geodesic equations are solved. Caustics and global rotation are discussed.
Evidence is presented for Hawking's viewpoint that in an insulated box in thermal equilibrium, black holes should form and evaporate in a statistically time-symmetric way. In particular, it is shown that if a black hole can evaporate adiabatically, it is much more likely to form adiabatically than by Jeans instability.
We examine the entropy of self-gravitating radiation confined to a spherical box of radius<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> in the context of general relativity. We expect that configurations (i.e., initial data) which extremize total entropy will be spherically symmetric, time symmetric distributions of radiation in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Assuming this is the case, we prove that extrema of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> coincide precisely with static equilibrium configurations of the radiation fluid. Furthermore, dynamically stable equilibrium configurations are shown to coincide with local maxima of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>. The equilibrium configurations and their entropies are calculated and their properties are discussed. However, it is shown that entropies higher than these local extrema can be achieved and, indeed, arbitrarily high entropies can be attained by configurations inside of or outside but arbitrarily near their own Schwarzschild radius. However, if we limit consideration to configurations which are outside their own Schwarzschild radius by at least one radiation wavelength, then the entropy is bounded and we find S<sub>max</sub> ≲ MR, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the total mass. This supports the validity for self-gravitating systems of the Bekenstein upper limit on the entropy to energy ratio of material bodies.
A scalar-tensor theory of gravitation with scale invariance broken spontaneously is examined to show if and how the finite-range force added to the ordinary Newtonian force can be composition independent in the Eötvös experiment.
Using the weak-field approximation, we show that the Weyl focusing of rays in a beam of light which passes around a number of spherical deflectors may be approximated by the Ricci focusing of the beam due to the enclosed mass.
We develop hydrodynamics in a new geometrical gravitational theory, called<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em><sub>4</sub> gravity, which we recently proposed. According to this formulation, matter is not necessarily conserved. The nonconservation of matter might have been considerable in an early era of cosmological evolution.
The nonthermal emission of a rotating black hole is related to the inner horizon of the hole. The transition from the Kerr black hole state to the naked singularity state is considered as a phase transition. An arrangement of the energetics of Kerr black holes into a two-phase thermodynamics is suggested.
For the axially symmetric, electrostatic vacuum problem, there are three unknowns:<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>00</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>11</sub>, and φ, the electrostatic field. Herlt, using his generation methods, has presented several new solutions by explicitly giving<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>00</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em> only. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>11</sub> is now determined in two cases and a detailed discussion of these solutions is given. The solutions do not, in general, possess the overlapping equipotential structure [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>00</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>00</sub>(φ)] which characterizes the Weyl class. One of the classes contains metrics which can be physically interpreted as representing exterior space-times of non-Weyl “two-body”-type charged “point” sources. With the specialization of the arbitrary parameters, the above solutions do reduce to known Weyl solutions. The Bonnor solution is a member of one of the above classes and consequently a possible physical reinterpretation of this solution is given. Kinnersley transformations applied to the above classes yield stationary space-times with line singularities and NUT-like asymptotic behavior.
An exact solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations representing a Schwarzschild black hole in an external gravitational field is derived using a formalism developed by Ernst.
It is shown that if in some local coordinate system the components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>i</sup><sub>jkl</sub> of the curvature tensor of an empty space-time are known, then, provided the space-time is not of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> with hypersurface orthogonal geodesic rays, the components of the metric tensor are uniquely determined up to a trivial constant scaling factor. The Petrov type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> empty space-times with hypersurface orthogonal geodesic rays are investigated. The most general mappings leaving the curvature tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>i</sup><sub>jkl</sub> invariant are found for each class of these space-times.
A conformai technique is given for the generation of exact solutions for the spherically symmetric vacuum field in the general Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt scalar-tensory theory with vanishing cosmological constant. We discuss in particular the solution for Schwinger's theory and for models with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em><sup>n</sup> coupling or with curvature coupling. It appears that all theories with vanishing cosmological term lead to the presence of naked singularities.
The general solution for the third-order Killing tensor equation in the Schwarzschild space-time is written down. It follows that the Schwarzschild metric admits only redundant Killing tensors of order 3.
It is shown that the field equations of general relativity never afford a minimum or maximum-not even locally-to the action integral<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>. Solutions of the field equations always represent a stationary value of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>.
A geometric unification of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields is presented. The unified field is described by a linear connection Γ on the space-time. Field equations for the unified field Γ are equivalent to Einstein-Maxwell equations. Field equations for matter interacting with the unified field are the usual ones. The interaction of the unified field with a charged scalar field is studied in detail.
The spin coefficients, the curvature tensor, and the first covariant derivative of the curvature tensor are shown to be insufficient for a complete description of a gravitational field. The inadequacy of the description becomes evident when a set of (unphysical) inequivalent metrics is constructed which cannot be distinguished by only examining these entities. The inequivalence manifests itself in the second covariant derivative.
The left-flat plane wave solutions are examined structurally and the family of totally null two-surfaces which are the points of the corresponding deformed twistor space are exhibited explicitly. This family is then used to generate a good-cut function which exhibits these plane waves as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> spaces in a generalized setting which is discussed.
We study the stability of a class of two-dimensional cylindrical space-times with quasiregular singularities using massless scalar waves. The fact that the stress-energy scalar<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sup> diverges indicates the instability of the singularity toward formation of a scalar curvature singularity. In special cases a nonscalar curvature singularity results.
The unified theory of gravitation and a Yang-Mills field is formulated as a dynamical theory of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>+3) geometries presumed to be principal bundles endowed with a Riemannian metric. Beyond the usual constraint equations the second fundamental form should satisfy a third constraint equation. It is shown that they have a wormhole-type solution describing a pair of Yang-Mills charges.
We consider some properties of the space-times which contain a spatially homogeneous domain of dependence<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D(V)</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em> is a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">compact</em> achronal spatial hypersurface of homogeneity. For example, it is shown that if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> has a nonempty future Cauchy horizon then the timelike geodesies orthogonal to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> are future incomplete and there is strong causality failure on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sup>+</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>). Also, conditions for the global hyperbolicity of such space-times are obtained.
Interior solutions for a static, axially symmetric family of solutions of Einstein's equations are described. The interior solutions correspond to spatially bound matter and are properly matched to an exterior vacuum solution. The family of solutions discussed include the Schwarzschild solution as a special case. A general method is exhibited for transforming any spherically symmetric interior solution to an interior for the other members of the family of solutions. The energy density remains positive for at least a finite range of the parameter that describes the family of solutions. Two solutions are explicitly exhibited. One is transformed from the constant density Schwarzschild interior solution and one from the Adler interior solution. The first solution would be expected to be unstable under adiabatic perturbations of the matter, the second would be expected to be stable.

It is shown that a family of exact, radiating solutions of Einstein's field equations (the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> metrics) is asymptotically flat at spatial infinity (in the sense of Ashtekar-Hansen). The ADM and Bondi masses are discussed.
It is shown that Karmarkar's condition which has been claimed to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the spherically symmetric (s.s.) space-time to be of class 1 ceases to be sufficient in case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>2323</sub>=0. An s.s. line element which satisfies Karmarkar's condition but ceases to be of class 1 is given. This line element describes a conformally flat perfect fluid distribution with zero density.
An attempt to produce a continuous creation theory by adapting the Brans-Dicke theory is described. The universe is seen to be created out of self-contained gravitational, scalar, and matter fields. However, the solution of the one-body problem reveals unsatisfactory characteristics of the theory, and in particular the principle of equivalence is severely violated. A second theory is described which retains the attractive features of the first theory and which does not fall foul of its objections. There do exist empirical tests for the theory which are described and which will require further examination. In the limit this theory approaches general relativity in every respect.
The generalized Newman-Penrose formalism is used to analyze semiclassical aligned spin fluids satisfying the Weyssenhoff restriction in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory. Some general properties are derived and the formalism is then used to obtain two classes of exact solution. One has a flat metric, but the fluid has in general nonzero acceleration, expansion, and shear. It is characterized by two arbitrary constants and two functions of two variables satisfying one partial differential equation. In the other class the fluid has nonzero acceleration and vorticity, and the free gravitational field is of type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>. It is characterized by three arbitrary constants and an arbitrary function of two spacelike coordinates.
The effect of post-Newtonian potentials on the rotation of a perfect fluid, nearly rigid body is shown to consist of a precession and a torque. The frequency of the precession can be exactly represented by means of suitable differential operators. The relativistic torques, in the quadrupole approximation, depend on the instantaneous orientation of the principal axes of one body with respect to the position-like the classical torque-and velocity of the other. For a relatively low-mass body, such as a gyroscope, these velocity-dependent torques have no observable consequences.
Einstein's equations are rewritten in terms of a certain torsionless linear connection Γ<sup>α</sup><sub>βμ</sub> which differs, in general, from the Levi-Civita metric connection γ<sup>α</sup><sub>βμ</sub>. The torsionless connection Γ<sup>α</sup><sub>βμ</sub> appears in a natural way as the canonical momentum of the gravitational field g<sub>μ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em></sub>. Einstein's equations have a simple interpretation in terms of the connection Γ<sup>α</sup><sub>βμ</sub>. The equivalence of the so-called<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">purely metric, purely affine</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">metricaffine theories of gravitation</em> is proved.
We calculate the force between two well-separated bodies in a fully dynamic system of two extended bodies up to and including the second post-Newtonian approximation (PNA). We use the iteration procedure as formulated by Anderson and Decanio in a version whose divergences have been pushed to the third PNA. We show the following, (i) The force law assumes the “Newtonian form” if a second approximation in 1/(separation of the bodies) is made; (ii) the mass terms appearing in the force law are the (Tolman) masses of the individual bodies expanded up the second PNA; the interal masses equal the (passive and active) gravitational masses of the bodies in order considered; they are all constants of the motion; (iii) the self-fields of the bodies vanish in the second PNA; hence there is no Nordvedt effect in the second PNA; (iv) the compactness of the bodies, i.e., (gravitational radius)/(body size), does not appear in the force law; only the relation between mass and the matter variables is changed in the PNA as compared with the corresponding Newtonian result.
The inverse scattering method is applied to a class of space-times belonging to the Bianchi types I–VII. Solitonic perturbations corresponding to one or two poles on an arbitrary cosmological background are described in detail. The fundamental matrix<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em><sub>0</sub> is explicitly calculated for a Bianchi II background, thus providing the first known example of a non-diagonal case.
All stationary, spherically symmetric solutions of Jordan's unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism are constructed. Conditions for the solutions are given to represent black holes with nonvanishing mass, electric and magnetic charge.
Among the three basic variational approaches to general relativity, the metric-affine variational principle, according to which the metric and the affine connection are varied independently, is commonly known as the “Palatini method.” In this paper we revisit the history of the “golden age” of general relativity, through a discussion of the papers involving a variational formulation of the field problem. In particular we find that the original Palatini paper of 1919 was rather far from what is usually meant by “Palatini's method,” which was instead formulated, to our knowledge, by Einstein in 1925.
Compact complex manifolds solutions of the Euclidean Einstein equations with a Λ term are examined, through a survey of the literature on the classification of complex surfaces.
Homogeneous cosmological models of all Bianchi types with a general (nondiagonal) metric are considered near the singularity. The spaces are filled with an arbitrary sourceless six-component electromagnetic field (EMF) and a perfect fluid at rest. It is shown that in the general case the models of types VI<sub>0</sub>, VII<sub>0</sub>, VIII, and IX have an oscillatory regime. The models of all the other types have Kasner asymptotics. The main result of the present paper is the derivation of the law of rotation of the Kasner axes.
The relation between the spherically symmetric Julia-Zee dyon of the coupled Yang-Mills-Higgs system and the cosmological term is studied in curved space-time. It is pointed out that the cosmological term comes out of the Higgs field.
S. W. Hawking suggests that quantum gravity introduces a new level of uncertainty into physics by turning pure states into mixed states. Although the evidence for this information loss is based upon a semiclassical approximation and hence is not conclusive, it is interesting to examine the implications. As originally formulated, Hawking's proposal violates CPT invariance by singling out one direction of time in which pure states turn into mixed states. An alternate hypothesis is suggested whereby the theory could be time symmetric and yet allow a loss of information. In this model the universe as a whole would be an open system, and even its density matrix would not have a deterministic evolution. The question remains of how much uncertainty there actually is in quantum gravity.



A new Lagrangian theory of gravitation in which the metric and the arbitrary affine connection are regarded as independent field variables has been considered. Making use of the pure geometrical objects only from the variational principle the empty field equations are derived. It is shown that the metric obeys the ordinary Einstein equations of general relativity. However, the covariant derivative of the metric tensor does not vanish, so that the vector's length is generally nonintegrable under the parallel displacement. The torsion trace vector turns out to be the natural dynamical variable, satisfying the Maxwell-like equations with tensor of homothetic curvature as the Maxwell tensor. The equations of motion are explored; they are shown to be identical to the motion of electric charge under the Lorentz force. The conservation laws are discussed.
We investigate the conditions under which the class of ghost-free, tachyon-free<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R + R</em><sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sup>2</sup> theories with torsion satisfy Birkhoff's theorem. We prove a weakened Birkhoff theorem requiring an additional assumption of parity invariance for two Lagrangians one of which contains torsion squared terms in addition to curvature squared terms. For another Lagrangian, also containing torsion squared terms, a weakened Birkhoff theorem requiring the additional assumptions of parity invariance and constant scalar curvature is proven. A special case of this Lagrangian is shown to satisfy a weakened Birkhoff theorem requiring only the additional assumption of constant scalar curvature. In addition the explicit dependence of torsion on parity noninvariant quantities is displayed.
Black holes have piqued much curiosity. But thus far they have been important only in “remote” subjects like astrophysics and quantum gravity. We show that the situation can be improved. By a judicious application of black hole physics, one can obtain new results in “everyday physics.” For example, black holes yield a quantum universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for ordinary thermodynamical systems which was unknown earlier. It can be checked, albeit with much labor, by ordinary statistical methods. Black holes set a limitation on the number of species of elementary particles-quarks, leptons, neutrinos-which may exist. And black holes lead to a fundamental limitation on the rate at which information can be transferred for given message energy by any communication system.
We present a selective review of the problem of the general relativistic prediction for the gravitational radiation emitted by gravitationally interacting systems with particular emphasis upon the two-body problem.
The assumption that the Higgs scalar field equation is conformally invariant leads to new features of the unified gauge theories including classical gravitation. Both the self-consistent approach and the external curved space-time method are discussed here. The purpose is to compute the upper and lower bounds on the mass of the stable Higgs particle. Also an attempt to obtain a discrete mass spectrum at classical level was made.
Quantum gravity as a theory initially exhibiting full conformal invariance is examined. The vacuum expectation value which breaks the symmetry to local Poincaré invariance can produce a cosmological constant as large as the QCD color charge. This result, previously founded through the analysis of the classical solutions by De Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan, is confirmed by the present calculation of the cosmological constant.
The steady and axially symmetric flow of a perfect fluid is studied in the context of general relativistic gas dynamics. It is assumed that the flow occurs in the background field of a rotating black hole (or any compact object). The hydrodynamic equations are referred to a locally nonrotating frame and their characteristics are found. The equations describing oblique shock waves are also obtained.
Penrose's abstract index notation and axiomatic introduction of covariant derivatives in tensor calculus is generalized to fields with internal degrees of freedom. The result provides, in particular, an intrinsic formulation of gauge theories without the use of bundles.
An investigation of the vacuum Einstein gravitational field equations for cylindrically and axially symmetric space-times is presented which leads to an equivalent differential system involving a simple nonlinearity only. The case when this equivalent system is linear is analyzed in detail and two methods for generating solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations are set up. As a result, in the axially symmetric case the linearity of the equivalent system characterizes completely the Kramer-Neugebauer transforms of Papapetrou line elements. Accordingly, Weyl solutions are shown to generate exhaustively both Lewis and van Stockum solutions. Analogous results are obtained also in the cylindrically symmetric case.
We consider gravitational interaction between two spinning pointlike particles. We use a fastmotion approximation and we obtain the first-order gravitational field and motion equations. Following the method developed by Bel and Martin we get up to the first order: the accelerations, momentum, energy, and a Hamiltonian of the system. This Hamiltonian, when it is expanded in a power series of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−1</sup>, agrees with those of earlier authors, who use different techniques.
We investigate the generalized Einstein equations derived from the Lagrangian which is an arbitrary function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. The importance of the saturation phenomenon is underlined, which may replace the role of a cosmological constant. The spherically symmetric homogeneous model is analyzed in more detail, and an approximate solution without singularity is constructed using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.
It is shown that the gravitational radiation energy flux from a quasiperiodic binary system is given by the quadrupole formula contribution plus a nonlinear contribution which has been neglected in the past. The latter is found to depend on both the intensity of the gravitational field and the history of the radiating system. For PSR 1913+16, the nonlinear contribution to the energy flux may be neglected relative to that of the quadrupole formula.
We determine the formula giving the energy absorbed per unit time by a nearly Newtonian system whose dimensions are small compared with the wavelength of an incident plane gravitational wave. We also indicate the variation of angular momentum. In order to determine them, we must take into account the nonlinear nature of the Einstein equations.
The object of this paper is to review the detector of a gravitational wave that was proposed by Braginsky and Mensky (1971). The derivation of the sensitivity is based on the same assumption as they proposed. It is concluded that the phase difference is linear in time and that the sensitivity of this detector is different from the result claimed by Braginsky and Mensky. The foundation to obtain the phase difference, i.e., the sensitivity, in this paper is not the frequency as they used but rather the movement of the wave front in the detector.
It is shown that if the past light cone of an observer is isotropic and has a caustic (i.e., contains points which are conjugate to the observer along a null geodesic) then the spacetime admits a compact (S<sup>3</sup>) spacelike hypersurface. The result is valid for space-times with dimension ⩾ 4.
It is suggested that in general the topological constraints imposed upon matter fields propagating in a cosmology need not be absolutely determined by the cosmological topology, which consequently allows for the possibility of different fields carrying different global structures. Quantum field stability is investigated for a particular model.
A new class of gravitational antennas that utilize the general relativistic Sagnac effect is proposed. These antennas may be more efficient than the Weber bar by a factor of (c/v<sub>s</sub>)<sup>4</sup> ∼ 10<sup>19</sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sub>s</sub>is the velocity of sound in the bar. A specific case of such an antenna consisting of a superfluid helium Josephson interferometer is considered. A general relativistic theory of the interaction of the superfluid with the gravitational field is given. Using this theory, the phase shift due to a gravitational plane wave on one such antenna is obtained. More generally, the proposed interferometer involves the interplay of general relativity and quantum theory and may afford the possibility of testing general relativity in the laboratory at the quantum mechanical level. The possibility of detecting gravitons, assuming nearly unit coupling efficiency for the antenna, is explored.
We describe how new ideas in dynamical systems theory find application in the description of general relativistic systems. The concept of dynamical entropy is explained and the associated invariant evaluated for the Mixmaster cosmological model. The description of cosmological models as measure preserving dynamical systems leads to a number of interconnections with new ideas in non-linear dynamics. This may provide a new avenue of approach to ascertaining the nature of the general solution to Einstein's equations.
Møller's tetrad theory of gravitation is included in Poincaié gauge theory for a special choice of parameters. In both theories the conservation theorems are derived from the field equations. They have the same form as in Einstein's theory. We compare the invariance properties of the field equations and discuss questions concerning the interpretation and measurability of the tetrad coefficients.
A path integral formulation is used in the superspace of geometries leading to a model of quantum gravity. It is shown that this method agrees with the standard path integral technique in the special case of Friedmann universes. A Schrödinger-like equation is set up, leading to the stationary states. Some solutions to these equations are presented.
Cosmological dust solutions have been obtained in Bianchi type-I homogeneous space for Brans-Dicke modified theory by the condition of the cosmological parameter Λ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>).
An experiment is proposed in which the length of a laser cavity depends on the force of gravity. A change in the gravitational constant will cause a change in the frequency of the laser, which may be measured relative to a reference laser. If an iodine stabilized He-Ne laser is used as the reference<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/G</em> can be measured to an accuracy of 4×10<sup>−12</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>.
Passage of the Schwarzschild radius is shown to be locally measurable by a sign change in a certain scalar. In the Kerr solution this scalar changes sign at the stationary limit. This is an example of the use of a coordinate-invariant method, based on the curvature tensor and a finite number of its covariant derivatives, for investigating gravitational fields.
The dynamical equations associated with polarized media in equilibrium are derived from a standard action. This approach applies to arbitrary thermodynamical models of the medium and provides a systematical method for the computation of the total energy-stress tensor for the coupled system of matter and fields.
The observable cosmos is modeled as a set of point-particles, representing the galaxies, which perturb a dust-filled, Robertson-Walker space-time. The analysis proceeds only to first order in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>=8<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">πG/c</em><sup>2</sup> and employs a metric suggested by McVittie [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">General Relativity and Cosmology</em> (Chapman and Hall, London, 1965)], whose original work this paper seeks to develop. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for the metric to give rise to an energy tensor of a chosen form appropriate to the modeling. In particular, a second-order equation is found which governs a certain time-independent potential. A class of solutions to this equation is established, and the associated singularities of the mass density are shown to be of a Dirac type.
A criterion is given under which essential singularities occur in any space-time having compact spacelike slices whose size (measured by a parallelly propagated frame) shrinks to zero, and where there is a timelike congruence with incomplete curves.
For a certain class of three-manifolds, the angular momentum of an asymptotically flat quantum gravitational field can have half-integral values. In the absence of a full theory of quantum gravity, this result relies on a set of apparently natural assumptions governing the kinematics of such a theory. A key feature is that state vectors are in general invariant only under asymptotically trivial diffeomorphisms that can be continuously deformed to the identity. Angular momentum is associated with diffeomorphisms that look asymptotically like rotations; and the question of whether half-integral values occur depends on whether the diffeomorphism associated with a 2π rotation is itself deformable to the identity.
Penrose has given a twistor description of all self-dual complex Riemannian space-times. We modify his construction to characterize all complex Riemannian space-times and all complex teleparallel space-times. This construction may be useful in finding non-self-dual solutions to the gravitational field equations (Einstein's or otherwise) without or with sources. It may also lead to a nonperturbative method for computing path integrals. Whereas Penrose shows that a self-dual space-time may be specified by a deformation of projective twistor space (the set of α planes in complex Minkowski space), we find that a Riemannian or teleparallel space-time may be described by a deformation of projective ambitwistor space (the set of null geodesics in complex Minkowski space).
We study positive frequency mode solutions of a massive scalar field at an initial stage in the spatially flat, linearly expanding Robertson-Walker universe. The essential point is that the initial time is taken to be small enough, but nonzero (e.g., the Planck time), and the mode is determined by a kind of WKB condition. We calculate the created particle spectrum, and show that its low-energy behavior is considerably different from the previous results.
A class of Lorentzian metrics in one variable that admits homothetic transformation is introduced. Solutions of Einstein's empty space equations are presented. The case of perfect fluids is discussed.
This paper presents a coordinate-dependent 3+ 1 decomposition of the general relativity field equations in terms of a scalar potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ≡c</em><sup>2</sup>[(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>−1], a vector potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><sub>i</sub>≡<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cg</em><sub>4i</sub>/(−g<sub>44</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>, and the three-space metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em><sub>ij</sub>≡<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ij</sub>−g<sub>4i</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>4j</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub>. The equations are exact and the form of the decomposed equations is valid in any coordinate system.

We present an extension of the recently discussed algorithm [1, 2] for deciding the equivalence problem for Riemannian metrics. The extension determines the structure constants of the isometry group and enables us to obtain some information about its orbits, including the form of the Killing vectors in canonical coordinates.
A unified treatment of conservation laws in general relativity, gauge theories, and elementary particle physics is formulated in the setting of principal fiber bundles. The group AUT(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>) is introduced as the general gauge transformation group that covers space-time coordinate transformations. A set of master equations is exhibited for any Lagrangian density generally covariant with respect to AUT(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>). The symmetry group for elementary particle theory is shown to be the structure group of the bundle only in the special case when the gauge potential is flat and the space-time is simply connected. In the general case, the symmetry group is reduced to the symmetry group of the gauge potential. This natural mechanism for a reduction of the symmetry group is speculated on as a model for spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Exact cosmological solutions of the Einstein- Cartan-Maxwell equations with spin, “stiff” matter and an electromagnetic field for Bianchi type-V universes are obtained. A class of nonsingular solutions is presented. The most important characteristic of these solutions is that in one case the effect of the electromagnetic field is to reduce the value of the minimum volume while in another case there exists the possibility of enlarging this value arbitrarily.
Metrics of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>2</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dy</em><sup>2</sup>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dz</em><sup>2</sup> are considered and found to contain rotating dust solutions as well as pure radiation fields.
Einstein's principle of general relativity is a dynamical-group approach in that all dynamics is implied by the invariance and no force is introduced (as an external, symmetry-breaking factor). In this spirit we take a Poincaré-invariant free wave equation and, deforming the Poincaré group to the de Sitter group, obtain interaction. This illustrates our algebraic approach to gauge invariance, whereby the (generalized) Maxwell tensor of the Yang-Mills field appears as structure constants of the homogeneous algebra obtained as a deformation of an inhomogeneous one, with interaction appearing via the same tensor, which plays a role corresponding to the curvature tensor in Einstein's general relativity.


Starting from the Ricci identity for the 4-velocity vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub>,a mathematical identity is derived, in terms of the kinematic quantities and the Riemann curvature tensor, for ω,<sub>a</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>, the derivative along a magnetic field line of the magnitude of the vorticity of an electrically conducting fluid. Maxwell's field equations are not used in the derivation and the result is true for a fluid with finite, infinite, or even nonuniform, electric conductivity. Previous results [3–5] derived for an infinitely conducting fluid are obtained as special cases. By expressing the Riemann curvature tensor in terms of the Ricci and Weyl tensors, Einstein's field equations are introduced and the role played by the free gravitational field is examined. It is found that ω,<sub>a</sub>H<sup>a</sup> does not depend on the electric part of the Weyl tensor and that, for an infinitely conducting fluid satisfying certain “steady state” conditions, ω,<sub>a</sub>H<sup>a</sup> is independent of that part of the curvature determined locally through Einstein's field equations.
An elementary derivation of the Kerr solution of Einstein's empty field equations is described.
The dynamics of a system of relativistically interacting particles is determined by a set of constraints, some combination of which has been frequently identified with the Hamiltonian. These constraints differ from the generators of the Poincaré transformations, among which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em><sub>0</sub> generates translations along the time axis and hence is to be considered as the energy of the system. There are thus grounds for considering<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sub>0</sub> as the appropriate Hamiltonian. In this paper we establish a close relationship between transformations generated by the constraints and those generated by the Poincaré generators. In particular we find that the true Hamiltonian is a rather complicated but well-defined function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em><sub>0</sub> and all the constraints. We show that the generators of the entire algebra of the Poincaré group can be realized in such a fashion that the Hamiltonian is correctly included among them, and such that particle world lines in Minkowski space-time generated by this Hamiltonian transform correctly under the Poincaré group.
A problem of nonexpanding right congruences of null strings in algebraically degenerate right-flat spaces is discussed and reduced to one differential equation. Then the form of the “key” function from the right side for some subclass of metrics is studied.
We derive constraint-free, coupled wave equations for the propagation of coupled electromagnetic and gravitational waves traveling through a time-dependent inhomogeneous medium. The medium consists of an arbitrary gravitational field, dust, a cold two-fluid plasma, and an arbitrary magnetic field. In this first of two papers we apply a two-timing ansatz to the constraint-free system of wave equations. In the second paper, dispersion relation and transport equations are found by means of a WKB analysis.
An attempt has been made to construct nonsingular cosmological models in Brans-Dicke theory by taking vacuum field as the long-range interacting scalar field which tends to avert the occurrence of initial singularity in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. Such a model will possess an extremely small value of coupling parameter ω, “as such they will be characteristically different from the usual Brans-Dicke models with ω ⩾ 6.” A justification for the estimated value of coupling parameter in the present paper has been given with particular reference to the helium problem. The model satisfies the initial conditions as proposed by Salam, Sinha, etc. However, it predicts a larger value of the energy density at the present epoch.
A model problem designed to incorporate several of the features of slow-motion gravity is analyzed. In common with a previous model calculation the present work supports the idea that divergent integrals which arise in analytic quasistationary perturbation schemes are artifacts of these schemes and can be eliminated by using singular perturbation techniques, in which they get replaced by finite nonanalytic terms. The new features of the present model are (1) it illustrates the necessity of straining the outgoing null coordinate to eliminate logarithmic nonuniformities in nonlinear order for large radius, and (2) it is exactly solvable for the pure-frequency case, which gives an important check on the approximation scheme. Straining the null coordinate immediately introduces time-odd terms in the near zone which are larger than the standard linear-theory damping result. However, these terms are shown to be spurious in that they are canceled by higher-order contributions in the approximation scheme. Thus the standard linear-theory damping result holds in the model, even when nonlinear effects are considered.
Two definitions of a black hole are given without reference to the boundary at infinity of of space-time. One definition does not require any global causality condition and the other is applicable to a closed Friedmann-like space-time. The area theorem is found to hold in both cases.
The study of a previously proposed theory of gravitation [Petry, W. (1979).<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gen. Rel. Grav.</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">10</strong>, 599; (1981).<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ibid</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">13</strong>, 865] is continued. The field equations are given in a simple covariant form. For a perfect fluid with pressure the static spherically symmetric solutions of the gravitation theory are studied. Inertial and gravitational mass are identical. The solutions agree with the corresponding results of the theory of general relativity up to high order in the coupling constant. Under some “natural” conditions the solutions of a static spherically symmetric body are not singular.
The problem of two Schwarzschild black holes on a time-symmetric spacelike hypersurface is investigated. The location of the closed trapped region and the apparent horizon is calculated. It is shown that the topology of the closed trapped region is not as previously believed.
By perturbation of Robertson-Walker's metric we prove Bonnor's equation which governs the growth of density fluctuations at Newtonian approximation.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>)-dimensional theory is studied using the method of differential geometry. The invariant line element is uniquely determined by the connection one-form which is invariant under the local gauge transformations. Generalized Lorentz equations are derived as the geodesic equations. One of these equations is that for a spinning point particle in gravitation which violates the strong equivalence principle.
We show that the decomposition of the space of covariant two-tensors on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>3</sup> is true in weighted Hölderian spaces, as in weighted Sobolev spaces, in the general case, that is without supposing the metric near the flat metric. M. Cantor proved, first, that a splitting of two-covariant tensor fields on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>n</sup> in weighted Sobolev spaces was true. We apply this result to solve the problem of constraints, in general relativity; we show that this problem admits a solution in the most general case.
We analyze the fluctuations of the gravitational field, produced by the cosmological term, in the empty Bianchi type-IX cosmological model. It is shown that such fluctuations do not change the process of alternation of Kasner eras very near to the singularity, and that a positive cosmological constant leads to an asymptotic isotropization of the model.
From the standpoint of cosmology, we investigate the relationship between the Brans-Dicke scalar field ø and the scalar field in particle physics (hereafter abbreviated as p.p.) on the assumption that ø is an arbitrary function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>, but not of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t.</em> And also we see whether the cosmological term A which was originally introduced into cosmology without a relationship to p.p. can be related to the symmetry-breaking term in p.p., supposing a dependence of A upon ø.
A natural extension of the supersymmetric model of Di Vecchia and Ravndal yields a nontrivial coupling of classical spinning particles to torsion in a Riemann-Cartan geometry. The equations of motion implied by this model coincide with a consistent classical limit of the Heisenberg equations derived from the minimally coupled Dirac equation. Conversely, the latter equation is shown to arise from canonical quantization of the classical system. The Heisenberg equations are obtained exact in all powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ</em> and thus complete the partial results of previous WKB calculations. We touch also on such matters of principle as the mathematical realization of anticommuting variables, the physical interpretation of supersymmetry transformations, and the effective variability of rest mass.
An extension of the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to third order in the expansion parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m/r</em> is used to derive analytical expressions accurate to the same order for the motion of test particles and photons in the presence of the gravitational field of the sun represented by a static, isotropic metric. The consequences of including higher-order terms are discussed in relation to the so-called classical gravitational tests for the case of general relativity theory. Present observational or experimental data are not accurate enough to detect variations due to the inclusion of higher-order terms but a planned solar probe experiment may provide information that would make such detection possible.
This is a review, covering known globally regular solutions describing either vacuum or fields with physically reasonable sources. The largest class is that with static spherical symmetry, but many others are known, even with A = 0. If A ≠ 0 there is a variety of regular cosmological solutions.
A static cosmological model in the Einstein-Cartan theory based on Lyra's modified Riemannian geometry is proposed. We assume that the spins of the individual particles composng the fluid are all aligned in the radial direction and observe the very interesting fact that if spin is there in this static Einstein universe, it should be constant and it can be given in terms of central density ρ<sub>0</sub> as<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(K = A = (1/4\pi )[(8\pi \rho _0 - 3/R^2 ) + \tfrac{3}{4}\beta ^2 ]^{1/2}\)</span>. The geometry and properties of the model are discussed.
The description of the effects of a gravitational field on the classical electromagnetic field equations in terms of generalized electric and magnetic permittivities is shown to define an “equivalent” medium with special properties. In particular it is remarked that such a medium can be chosen so as to include the behavior, in the presence of gravity, of the bodies that are used to produce and to detect the electromagnetic field. This is illustrated by the example of the gravitational red shift. The introduction of the proper time of the emitting and of the absorbing atoms, at rest in the gravitational field, is shown to define a medium interacting with the electromagnetic field through a drag velocity which increases linearly with time. For the sake of simplicity this example is described in the weak-field approximation.
In which sheep confirms Hauser's claim (and hopefully demonstrates just how powerful and flexible an interactive algebraic computing language can be as an aid in carrying out calculations in general relativity).
We study the rotation of the polarization plane of an electromagnetic wave due to a gravitational field. An evolution law for the polarization plane is derived in the geometric optics approximation. For the particular case of a Kerr space-time, we obtain the polarization plane rotation for an incident light ray parallel to the Z axis at z = -∞ and for a radially outgoing one. The results are compared with others which have already appeared in the literature.
The most general time-independent spherically symmetric (in the usual three space dimensions) solution to the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations is found, subject to the existence of a Killing vector in the fifth direction. The significance of these solutions is discussed within the context of a previously proposed extension of the Kaluza-Klein model in which the universe, although (4+1)-dimensional, has evolved over cosmic times into an effectively (3+l)-dimensional one.
A space-time is both a Riemannian manifold and a causal space. These structures give restrictions on one another. In this paper we consider restrictions determined by the causal structure on the manifold's geometry. It is shown in particular that the conformai electric part of the curvature must satisfy interesting nonlocal conditions.

The concept of Grassmannification of a Lie group, which is completely analogous to the concept of complexification of a Lie group, is introduced. Grassmannified Lie groups can also be viewed as ordinary real Lie groups. It is shown that every graded Lie algebra (= superalgebra) determines a subgroup (Kac-Berezin group, supergroup) in the Grassmannified full matrix group. On the other hand, it seems possible that not all supergroups can be found by a complete classification of all graded Lie algebras.
Explicit field equations in the general scalar-tensor theory of gravitation proposed by Nordtvedt are obtained with the aid of a static spherically symmetric conformally flat metric. Exact static solutions of Nordtvedt-Barker field equations both in vacuum and in the presence of a source-free electromagnetic field are presented and studied. It is shown that there are no spherically symmetric static conformally flat solutions of Nordtvedt-Barker field equations representing perfect fluid distribution with disordered radiation obeying the equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>=3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>, except for the trivial empty flat space-time of Einstein's theory.
The nonlinear graviton construction of Penrose is given explicitly for the nonlinear superposition of a finite number of plane waves with arbitrary propagation directions, phase, and amplitude profiles. These are realized as generalized<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">H</span>-spaces for which the asymptotic data are distributional and have singular support on a finite number of null generators of<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">I</span><sup>+</sup>.
The dominant energy condition in general relativity theory, which says that every observer measures a nonnegative local energy density and a nonspacelike local energy flow, is examined in connection with the types of energy-momentum tensor it permits. The condition that the energy-momentum tensor be “stable” in obeying the dominant energy condition is then defined in terms of a suitable topology on the set of energy-momentum tensors on space-time and the consequences are evaluated and discussed.
It is shown that the known analogies between general relativity and the nonlinear sigma models are not restricted to kinematics but extend also to the dynamics. Some comments are made on possible consequences of this point of view and on the so-called gauge theories of gravitation.
The creation of structure in the Lepton Era of the early universe is discussed in terms of a suitably chosen dynamical system of Brusselator type. A bifurcation analysis is performed and a criterion is extracted for the onset of instabilities in the system which in turn lead to self-organizing processes in the associated conglomerate of elementary particles which may be visualized as an imperfect fluid in the hydrodynamic approximation chosen here. This may be interpreted as a symmetry-breaking mechanism which might be responsible for the creation of protostructures on space-time due to density fluctuations, the latter being thought of as controlling the further agglomeration of matter once matter and radiation have decoupled at a temperature level of some 4000 K. This may eventually lead to the formation of galaxies as are observed in the present stage of the universe. The influence of curvature is discussed in considering a metric background of Bianchi type I with respect to the onset of instability. The notion of a local concept on space-time is reviewed from an interactive point of view.
Using the formalism of Cohen and Kegeles equations are obtained for arbitrary spin radiation field Debye potentials in Reissner-Nordström geometries, and a formal series solution is presented. For the case of integer spin the series is modified to what appears to be a more natural form. In the particular case of vanishing spin it is shown that in some important cases the modified series converges to a solution of the Debye potential equation, which is the scalar wave equation, and is simply related to characteristic initial data given on either H or<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">I</span>.
Some possibilities of reconciling general relativity with quantum theory are discussed. The procedure of quantization is certainly not unique, but depends upon the choice of the coordinate conditions. Most versions of quantization predict the existence of gravitons, but it is also possible to formulate a quantum theory with a classical gravity whereby the expectation values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">µv</em> </sub> constitute the sources of the classical metric field.
A space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is said to be conformally hyperbolic if the intrinsic conformal Lorentz pseudodistance<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> is a true distance. In this paper we first derive criteria which insure the conformal hyperbolicity of certain space-times which are generalizations of the Robertson-Walker spaces. Then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> is determined explicitly for Einstein-de Sitter space, and important cosmological model.
We consider the assumption that clocks measure proper time-that is, in a gravitational field ideal clocks are governed by the equation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub> dx<sup>i</sup> dx<sup>j</sup>-and give some theoretical and experimental constraints on clock measurements. In particular, we find that if we assume that clocks are governed by an equation of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>4</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ijkl</em> </sub> dx<sup>i</sup> dx<sup>j</sup> dx<sup>k</sup> dx<sup>l</sup>, then this equation must reduce to the quadratic equation in a weak, spherically symmetric, static gravitational field (at least to first order in the Newtonian gravitational potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>), otherwise “additional” contributions to the time-delay effect of radar propagation (that are not observed) are predicted.
In 1928 Jeans conjectured that there might be regions in space such as for example centers of galaxies through which matter could be flowing into our universe from other universes. We investigate if this conjecture extended to charged matter could be realized within the framework of general relativity with the help of black and white holes. By studying a test electromagnetic field produced by a point charge in the maximally extended Schwarzschild space-time we show that an observer at infinity always can get an information on the value of the charge even if it is hidden inside a white hole. Therefore we conclude that the Jeans conjecture cannot be realized for charged matter by a white hole. This result can be generalized to include a test gravitational field produced by a test mass hidden inside a white hole, hole.
The measurability analysis of quantum electrodynamics performed by Bohr and Rosenfeld is generalized in order to be applicable to gravitation. After briefly restating our earlier argument for the measurability of the components of the quantum linearized Weyl tensor field taken separately, we demonstrate in detail their measurability taken jointly. In comparing the measurability analysis of linearized gravitation with that of quantum electrodynamics, we are able to exhibit the pervasive differences between the analyses necessitated by the equivalence principle.
A version of the five-dimensional unified theory of gravitation, electromagnetism, and scalar field is developed. It is shown that in this theory the main features of Kaluza's five-dimensional theory and the Weyl one, based on non-Riemannian geometry and on conformal mapping, are combined. Some reasons are pointed out for choosing the physical 4-metric to be conformal (with the factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em><sup>2</sup>=−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>55</sub>) to the 4-metric obtained by 1+4 splitting of the initial five-dimensional manifold. It is shown that the electrical charge and current appear in the geometrical theory if the condition of cylindrical symmetry in the fifth coordinate is substituted by the condition of quasicylindrical symmetry (i.e., the physical 4-metric and the vector potential of electromagnetic field remain independent of the fifth coordinate, while the scalar field depends on it). Two kinds of the most important exact solutions of the 15 field equations are considered. They are (1) static spherically symmetrical solutions and (2) homogeneous isotropic cosmological models.
The momentum constraint of the initial-value problem of general relativity is addressed. The undressed extrinsic curvature of a general compact momentum source is presented in terms of multipole moment integrals.
In the early 1920s Brinkmann made the first significant contribution to the study of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em> waves in general relativity. Reference to his original work and to the later work of Ehlers and Kundt is made in order to rectify and clarify statements made recently by McInnes.


The existence of black holes in general relativity provides an effective cutoff to the negative gravitational potential. This results in a fundamental upper limit on the amount of energy that can be radiated away by any isolated system.
Synchronous frames are known to remove (at least partially) deficiencies inherent in Killing coordinates. Strangely enough, no constructive general method of finding these frames has been formulated, though it follows from the definition of synchronous coordinates; We propose here such a method and apply it to the Kerr metric to obtain a Novikov-type synchronous frame. The removal of nonphysical singularities is discussed in the context of 3-metric and 3-curvature on the spatial hypersurfaces in this frame.
Two theorems are given on the topology of geodesically complete space-times which satisfy the energy condition. Firstly, the condition that a compact embedded 3-manifold in space-time be dentless is defined in terms of causal structure. Then it is shown that a dentless 3-manifold must separate space-time, and that it must enclose a compact portion of space-time. Further, it is shown that if the dentless 3-manifold is homeomorphic to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup> then the part of space-time that it encloses must be simply connected.
Particle creation of vector mesons in nonstationary Friedman space-time is investigated by the method of diagonalizing the instantaneous Hamiltonian. The density of particles and the full stress-energy tensor are calculated. Reasons are given for the Higgs treatment of vector mesons in gravitational field creating pairs of particles.
It is shown that perfect fluid space-times can also satisfy the field equations for a magnetohydrodynamic fluid. The necessary conditions for this equivalence are found and the magnetohydrodynamic interpretations of the zero-curvature FRW model with equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ=3p</em>, and of the Gödel model are given.
Spherically symmetric perfect fluid distributions in general relativity have been investigated under the assumptions of (i) uniform expansion or contraction and (ii) the validity of an equation of state of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=p(ρ)</em> with nonuniform density. An exact solution which is equivalent to a solution found earlier by Wyman is obtained and it is shown that the solution is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unique</em>. The boundary conditions at the interface of fluid distribution and the exterior vacuum are discussed and as a consequence the following theorem is established:<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Uniform expansion or contraction of a perfect fluid sphere obeying an equation of state with nonuniform density is not admitted by the field equations</em>. It is further shown that the Wyman metric is not suitable on physical grounds to represent a cosmological solution.

It is shown that in a weakly asymptotically simple and empty space, according to classical general relativity, from nonsingular initial data no strong curvature singularity can arise that is visible from infinity.
This essay describes a new approach to the problem of understanding stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations, different from the “Bäcklund transformation” approach which has recently been extensively developed. It translates the problem into one of complex geometry, using the machinery of twistor theory. This, in turn, leads to a procedure which, in principle, generates all solutions. Some explicit examples are presented.
Contrary to earlier claims, it is shown that no singularities occur near a (Schwarzschild) black hole horizon.
Uniformly accelerated analogs of the stationary axially symmetric 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-soliton solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations obtained from flat space-time are discussed and the “static” case is studied in detail. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>-metric occurs as the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=1 solution while the Bonnor-Swaminarayan solution occurs as a certain<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = ∞ limit.
We describe an experimental technique for detecting extremely low-frequency pulses of gravitational radiation (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em><sub>GW</sub> ∼ 1–10 mHz) originating from collapsing supermassive objects (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> ∼ 10<sup>6</sup>−10<sup>7</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>⊙</sub>) occurring anywhere in the universe. Our technique is the natural outgrowth of a previous gravitational space mission. The novelty of our approach is in placing a highly stable hydrogen maser onboard a deep-space probe that controls a transmitter sending signals to earth. The spacecraft also includes a doppler transponder operating in the conventional two-way mode. Doppler tracking using simultaneously acquired one- and two-way information both on the spacecraft and at the earth station provides four time-records of frequency fluctuations. A single gravitational disturbance manifests itself as a uniquely determined pulse sequence in the two or more data sets whose amplitudes and arrival times depend on a single parameter. The repetition of the signal and the noises in the data can be used in a filtering scheme to improve the amplitude sensitivity by a factor of about 6 in amplitude (36 in energy). We believe the most likely of these gravitational pulse events occurring frequently enough to be detected (more than once per year) will come from the formation of black holes in the cores of ordinary spiral galaxies. We propose a technologically feasible and realistic space mission, using the above technique, to measure two aspects of gravitation with the same experimental equipment. The spaceflight begins in a highly eccentric earth orbit to measure the gravitational red shift and the second-order doppler effects to an accuracy of 5 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>; at this level significant new tests of nonmetric theories of gravity are possible. Later, the spacecraft is sent into a heliocentric orbit to distances beyond 6 AU to search for gravitational radiation.
Some results are obtained which establish conditions under which causality violation cannot occur in space-times admitting a compact, but not necessarily acausal, spacelike hypersurface. For example, it is shown that causality violation can occur in a space-time admitting a compact spacelike slice and obeying fairly reasonable energy conditions only if it is “singular” in the sense that some “causal interval”<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em><sup>+</sup>(p) ∩<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em><sup>−</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(q)</em> has noncompact closure.
Einstein's field equations are reduced to two real differential equations for one complex potential<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\phi (\zeta , \bar \zeta , u)\)</span>. The known classes of vacuum solutions are invariantly characterized in terms of this potential, and a new representation of the Kerr-Schild class of solutions is given.
If one defines the size of the present universe in terms of a hypersurface of simultaneity generated by the spatial geodesies orthogonal to our world line today, then it is finite in all expanding Big Bang Friedmann models.
We examined the complete form of the propagation equation of the expansion for null geodesies and we found some restrictions in integral form on the Ricci and Weyl tensors near a singularity.
We describe a process by which energy literally can be mined from a black hole. We argue that the only limit placed by fundamental considerations on the rate at which energy can be extracted from a black hole by this process is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dE/dt ∼</em> 1 in Planck units<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G = c = ħ</em> = 1. This is far greater than the rate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dE/dt</em> ∼ 1/M<sup>2</sup> at which the black hole spontaneously loses energy by Hawking radiation.
The temperature-dependent effective action for gravity is calculated in pregeometry. It indicates that the effective potential for the space-time metric has the minimum at the origin for extremely high temperature. The origin of the big bang can be taken as a local and spontaneous phase transition of the space-time from the pregeometric phase to the geometric one.
We describe the structure and the use of a program written in the algebraic programming language<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">reduce</span> 2, giving the super-Hamiltonian and supermomenta constraints, as well as Hamilton's canonical equations in terms of the canonical variables, for vacuum relativistic space-times. The program uses as input the components of the spatial metric tensor and of the corresponding canonically conjugate momenta in a coordinate or in a spatial Cartan basis. The results of the application of the program to a series of inhomogeneous (cosmological as well as noncosmological) space-times are given: in particular, the constraints, the Dirac Hamiltonian and the canonical equations are explicitly written for axisymmetric space-times, constituting the starting point for the study of the dynamics and of the canonical quantization of these configurations.
The question of to what extent zeta function regularization respects the invariances of a quantum field theory in a background gravitational field is investigated. It is shown that zeta function regularization provides a generalization to curved space-time of analytic propagator regularization which is known not to respect gauge invariance. Furthermore, a study of the regularized stress tensor of a conformally invariant scalar field indicates that both conformai and general coordinate invariance are violated.
Red shifts can turn blue and blue shifts can turn red in real astrophysical situations involving magnetic neutron stars. It is also possible for red shifts and blue shifts to be emitted simultaneously from the same object. With this general relativistic effect, the red shift may be arbitrarily large but the blue shift cannot exceed 1/2.
The radiative perturbations studied by Chang and Janis in the Newman-Penrose formalism are shown to be a proper subset of those treated in the approach pioneered by Lifshitz. A scheme is developed for treating the full set of purely radiative perturbations in Robertson-Walker backgrounds within the Newman-Penrose formalism. A description of the radiation is given in terms of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, and the governing wave equations are found.
In this paper the two-body problem in projective relativity is examined, in order to see whether particles gravitating near a large central mass follow or do not follow spiral trajectories. The latter are effectively found, under reasonable assumption; this result is compared with available astronomical evidence about spiral galaxies.



Several theories with scalar field can be derived from different variational principles. Here we consider a very general variational principle and we prove that, in the exterior case without electromagnetic field, the solution for a particular case generates the set of solutions for the general case. This is applied to the exterior solution in the static case with spherical symmetry without electromagnetic field. We investigate the predictions for the classic effects and the event horizons. Then we get some limitations for the variational principles which generalize the usual limitations. In all these cases the Schwarzschild solution with his horizon appears as a very particular case.
In this paper we have obtained some conformal flat interior solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for a charged stable static sphere. These solutions satisfy physical conditions inside the sphere.
Presented in this paper are exact nonstatic solutions for the coupled repulsive sourceless massless scalar field and the gravitational field. The solutions have the same form as the spatially conformally flat static metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2ψ</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>−2ψ</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dy</em><sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dz</em><sup>2</sup>).
The cosmic censorship conjecture states that naked singularities should not evolve from regular initial conditions in general relativity. In its strong form the conjecture asserts that space-times with Cauchy horizons must always be unstable and thus that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">generic</em> solution of Einstein's equations must be inextendible beyond its maximal Cauchy development. In this paper we shall show that one can construct an infinite-dimensional family of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extendible</em> cosmological solutions similar to Taub-NUT space-time. However, we shall also show that each of these solutions is unstable in precisely the way demanded by strong cosmic censorship. Finally we show that quantum fluctuations in the metric always provide (though in an unexpectedly subtle way) the “generic perturbations” which destroy the Cauchy horizons in these models.
The Einstein-Maxwell equations are solved with an energy-momentum tensor corresponding to the field of a standing electromagnetic wave outside a massive plane, in the limit where the test particle is much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. Physical properties of the solution are discussed.
We develop a special class of solutions of the Brans-Dicke equations from vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations by applying a method due to Teixeira, Wolk, and Som. It is shown that the electric charge contributes positively to the geometric mass while the Brans-Dicke scalar field diminishes the geometric mass effectively.
The relationship between electromagnetic fields and topology is discussed. Hodge theory is generalized to classify static fields in static wormhole models. This generalization is used to show models of the electron exist which have finite self-energy. These models always have 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup> electric fields and self-energies of 4π<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sup>2</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>0</sub>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>0</sub> is the inner radius of the wormhole.
It is shown that a dyon solution, characterized by five parameters (mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, angular momentum<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em>, electric charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>, magnetic charge Φ, and distortion parameter δ), has an event horizon for arbitrary odd integer δ and satisfies the Christodoulou-Ruffini mass formula.
The general vacuum solutions of the Brans-Dicke theory in a cosmological Robertson-Walker-type metric are explicitly given. Several families of solutions have properties which essentially differ from the conventional Einstein theory. The geometry is not uniquely determined by the equations of motion, raising doubts about the “Machian” character of the Brans-Dicke theory. The role of the cosmological constant is emphasized, in agreement with modern ideas of fundamental particle interactions.

A classification of the possible types of the relative orbits of realistic binary stars in the post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity is presented. Definitions of the relativistic conic sections and their elements are proposed, generalizing the corresponding ones of classical celestial mechanics. The results are compared and contrasted with the classical ones and some new predictions of purely post-Newtonian origin and nature are presented.
The representations of the Riemann and the Weyl tensors of a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold through covariant derivatives of third-order potentials are examined in detail. The Weyl tensor always admits a completely general representation whereas the Riemann tensor does not. Nevertheless there exists a class of Riemannian manifolds whose Riemann tensors may be calculated in terms of potentials; in this connection, specific examples are exhibited explicitly. The possibility of introducing gauges on the potentials is reexamined in connection with the previous result. New properties of the representations are also discussed.


A geometric model of a spin one-half charged particle based on a modified version of Weyl's unified model of electromagnetism and gravity is presented. The model predicts a short-range force which we identify with the strong force. A nuclear mass formula similar to the Weizsäcker mass formula provides experimental verification of the geometric approach.
The collapse of an infinitely thin spherical shell of charged matter, which surrounds a spherically symmetric black hole or has a flat interior, is analyzed in connection with the laws of black hole mechanics and the cosmic censorship hypothesis. An effective potential is introduced to describe the motion of the shell. The process, proposed by Farrugia and Hajicek as a counterexample to the third law, is discussed and generalized to the case of nondust shells.
The free of complex expansion type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> solutions of Einstein-Maxwell equations with cosmological constant possessing a noninvertible group of local isometries with null orbits for the alignment of the general electromagnetic field along the double<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D-P</em> directions are presented. These solutions are endowed with five continuous parameters, and are found to be a special case of the Carter non-null orbits metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B(−)</em>.
Increasing interest has been shown in the method of matched asymptotic expansions for the construction and solution of the equations of motion in general relativity. This paper discusses a simple model which can, in principle, be solved exactly. A comparison of the two solutions shows that the matched asymptotic expansion technique determines correctly the final damping rate and frequency (at least to fourth order in a small parameter), but the phase information is spurious.
A model for quantum gravity, in which the conformal part of the metric is quantized using the path integral formalism, is presented. Einstein's equations can be suitably modified to take into account the effects of quantum conformal fluctuations. A closed Friedman model can be described in terms of well-defined stationary states. The “ground state” sets a lower bound (at Planck length) to the scale factor preventing the collapse. A possible explanation for matter creation and quantum nature of matter is suggested.
Homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with trace-free energy-momentum tensors are studied in general scalar-tensor theories. A method is presented which allows one to construct exact solutions for theories with arbitrary coupling function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω(φ)</em>. Particular attention is paid to Schwinger's theory.
The charged static and spherically symmetric vacuum field in the general Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt (BWN) theory of gravity is studied. By a conformal transformation, the field equations are brought into a standard form, which permits a decoupling of the differential equations for the relevant quantities. Using the electrostatic potential as an independent variable results in a particular Ricatti equation, the general solutions of which can be explicitly written down, for positive and for negative scalar energy densities. In distinction with the Reissner-Nordström solutions, all nontrivial positive energy BWN theories are shown to possess naked timelike singularities, whereas the negative energy theories admit a peculiar nonsingular solution, which may be interpreted as a field theoretical model of a charged particle. It is argued that the absence of an event horizon in the other solutions is not a consequence of the assumption of spherical symmetry: event horizons are absent in any static geometry which is a nontrivial solution of the (charged or uncharged) BWN equations with positive definite scalar density.
Present astronomical data indicate an unbound universe with density ∼1.6 × 10<sup>−31</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup> in which galaxies could not have formed gravitationally. We show how magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes allow galaxy formation in an open anisotropic MHD universe with shear, rotation, and fluid flow. The dipole anisotropy of the microwave background radiation sets their respective first-order values at 3.7×10<sup>−15</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, 10<sup>−14</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, and 5×10<sup>−4</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>. Second-order effects of Maxwell and Reynolds stresses require that the magnetic field, shear, and Hubble expansion be 10<sup>−8</sup> G, 3.7×10<sup>−15</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, and 10<sup>−10</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (100 km sec<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup>). The model is rigidly self-consistent, predicting both the recent value of the Hubble expansion above and of the shear (≲ 9×10<sup>−15</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) given by the microwave background's recently measured quadrupole anisotropy.
After brief reviews of the Geroch and spin-coefficient formalism approaches to null infinity, we present a dictionary which translates between the two formalisms.
Quantum gravity is equivalent to a statistical mechanical system of classical fields in 4 + 1 dimensions at temperature<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ.</em> It is generically true that systems involving gravitation do not exist at fixed temperature. We therefore propose a fixed action description of quantum gravity. The formalism for a fixed action description of quantum field theory is developed. It is found to be equivalent to the canonical fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħ</em> formalism for renormalizable field theories. It is also found that, in precise analogy to the microcanonical formulation of statistical mechanics, it describes a wider class of theories than the canonical formalism.
Quantum mechanically described test particles enable a local measurement of the Riemann tensor via the interaction with the elementary particle spin. The corresponding procedure is discussed in detail. It is compared with three nonlocal methods, which are based on the behavior of classical macroscopic test particles. A central question thereby is if the complete set of components of the Riemann tensor can be determined.
A generalized notion of conformastat space-times is introduced in relativity theory. In this sense, the conformastat space-time is stationary with the three-space of timelike Killing trajectories being conformally flat. A 3+1 decomposition of the field equations is given, and two classes of nonstatic conformastat vacuum fields are exhaustively investigated. The resulting three metrics form a NUT-type extension of the solution of the static conformastat vacuum problem. We conjecture that all conformastat vacuum space-times are axially symmetric.
Two vector fields are considered, a timelike one,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup>α</sup>, and an arbitrary one, ξ<sup>α</sup>. The relative expansion and rotation are defined with respect to these fields, their mutual relations are studied, and some general formulas obtained. Applications are made, first to vector fields which are mutually nonrotating in a plane-symmetric metric, then to the electromagnetic field of an arbitrary magnetohydrodynamic fluid.
The vacuum<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>-metric is transformed to Weyl form. In the Weyl representation its sources are a spherical particle and a semi-infinite line mass, with a strut holding them apart. A further transformation, which enlarges the manifold, is carried out. The resulting metric is dynamic, with sources consisting of two spherical particles uniformly accelerated by a spring between them. An analysis of advanced and retarded potentials in the enlarged manifold reveals a close analogy with the Born solution for accelerated charges in electrodynamics.
Using the notion of size or volume of future or past of an event, causal functions are defined on a space-time and their behavior is examined in certain space-time models. These functions are then employed to obtain a unified characterization of causality conditions on a spacetime in terms of their simple functional properties like one-oneness, monotonicity, etc. and limiting behavior of these functions along timelike curves. Causal or ideal points boundary of space-time has also been characterized and classified using these causal functions.
Stationary solutions of the Einstein equation are investigated when the source is a rigidly rotating fluid. Using the three-dimensional spin coefficient method the angular dependence of the metric tensor can be analytically calculated if the eigenray congruence is geodesic and shear free. The nonstatic solutions of this class do not describe physically realistic bodies, but, instead, bodies with NUT-type geometry.
It is shown that for a very general class of space-times, the components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bcd</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup> </span> of the curvature tensor determine the metric components up to a constant conformal factor. This general class contains most of those cases which are usually considered to be interesting from the point of view of Einstein's general relativity theory. The connection between the above result and the existence of proper curvature collineations is given.
Recently a geometrical gravitational theory based on the coefficients of connection with two gauge fields was proposed. The objective of the present paper is to show that the geometry based on the coefficients of connection with two gauge fields can be obtained by the successive operations of conformal and projective transformations on Riemannian metric.

A new method for obtaining solutions to Einstein's field equations is presented. It is based on the description of a geometry in terms of the curvature tensor and a number of its covariant derivatives. These entities are used instead of the metric. Physical requirements, such as symmetries, are easily imposed in this picture. An example, including the Schwarzschild geometry, is discussed in detail, but no attempts to find new solutions are made.
An energy stress tensor satisfying Rainich's algebraic relations along with a specified metric tensor sometimes admits two alternative Maxwell fields-one with a nonvanishing current vector as source and the other without any source. This paper investigates the conditions for the existence of a source-free interpretation when a “with source” solution with various types of the source current vector (i.e., timelike, null, or spacelike) is known and illustrates the results with some examples. It turns out that in the case of timelike currents, a dual interpretation requires this to be a purely convection current, while in other cases a dual interpretation is possible only if the conductivity is infinite and the “conduction” current is in the direction of the magnetic field.
A general relativity model of nova and supernova explosions is studied and improved. Its classical limit is found, and the magnitude of the velocity and mass necessary to detect relativistic effects are computed.
An exact solution of the vacuum Brans-Dicke (BD) field equations has been obtained for the metric tensor of a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I cosmological model. The Kasner metric is shown to be a special case. Some physical properties of the model have been discussed.
A censorship theorem is established concerning space-times which are weakly asymptotically simple and empty according to a new definition. Future asymptotic predictability is shown to be a consequence of a criterion which bounds components of the Riemann tensor from below near locally naked singularities of a certain type.
A real structure is defined in asymptotically flat ℋ spaces and investigated in connection with the equations of motion in ℋ space.
The metric of type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> Robinson-Trautman space-times is generated by a real function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> satisfying certain field equations. Canonical forms for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> are obtained under the assumption that at least one curvature collineation exists. In order to give an example of the improper subgroup structure of a group of curvature collineations all the curvature collineations are determined for the space-times corresponding to one of the two canonical forms.
A preliminary investigation of global properties of the Stephani solution of the Einstein field equations is presented. This solution generalizes those of Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) in such a way that the spatial curvature index<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> (a constant in the FRW models) is a function of the time coordinate. The de Sitter solution, which is also a special case of the Stephani solution, is analyzed in the Stephani coordinates to gain insight into the global structure of the manifold and its foliation. The general metric is found to have several properties in common with this example. It has singularities which can be avoided either by matching the solution to an (as yet unknown) empty-space solution or confining the curvature index to be positive at all times.
We propose a bimetric machian approach to gravitation with a mathematical structure much simpler than the one of Rosen's bimetric theories. We obtain two cosmological models based on the simplest assumption that the Universe be filled of pure dust matter. One of the two cosmological models is compatible with the currently observed value of the density of dust matter, and provides an age of the Universe which is of the order of the inverse of the present Hubble parameter. One also obtains the Schwarzschild-like solution and its Newtonian limit together with the modified three Kepler laws which allow us to find that presently 0.5×10<sup>−10</sup> (yr)<sup>−1</sup> δ(A/A)δ 0.625×10<sup>−10</sup> (yr)<sup>−1</sup>, a denoting the semimajor axis of the orbit of the test particle. Lastly we obtain the Newtonian limit of the theory.

A generalized theory of gravitation is discussed which is based on a Riemann-Cartan space-time,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub>, with an axial vector torsion field. Besides Einstein's equations determining the metric of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub>, a system of nonlinear field equations is established coupling an axial vector source current to the axial vector torsion field. The properties of the solutions of these equations are discussed assuming a London-type condition relating the axial current and torsion field. To characterize the solutions use is made of the Euler and Pontrjagin forms and the associated quadratic curvature invariants for the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub> space-time. It is found that there exists for a Riemann-Cartan space-time a relation between the zeros of the axial vector torsion field and the singularities of the Pontrjagin invariant, which is analogous to the well-known Hopf relation between the zeros of vector fields and the Euler characteristic.
The linearized Einstein equations are written in the same form as the Maxwell equation. In the case of a weak stationary field and low velocity, the geodesic equations are written in the form of the Lorentz equation of motion. We suggest that the existence of the magnetic-type gravitation predicted by GR is equivalent to the existence of the gravitational wave predicted by GR. The Schiff effect is explained as one of the magnetic-type gravitation and the new effect is given. The Hall-type gravitational experiment is studied.

Using York's formulation of the constraint equations in general relativity, we prove the existence of a pair of solutions on IR<sup>3</sup> which coincide outside a compact set and have finite ADM-mass, one with material sources, the other one purely gravitational.
The presumed existence of atomic hydrogen in the vicinity of sources of gravitational radiation suggests its use as a radiation detector. Curvature-induced atomic energy level shifts carry a unique signature and could thus provide for remote detection of gravitational radiation. We investigate the shifts induced by space-time curvature arising from gravitational waves. The effect is studied for both low-lying and highly excited states of atomic hydrogen. Numerical results are quoted for radiation from various sources, including binary star systems, binary neutron stars, binary black holes, collapsing stars, and pulsars. In addition, we provide a theoretical upper limit to the magnitude of the effect. For completeness, we examine the shifts induced in a harmonic oscillator as well as a rigid rotator.
A metric containing a parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em><sup>2</sup>=1) has been obtained which represents a Kerr metric in the background of a static Einstein universe when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> is put equal to +1. The same metric will represent the external field of a mass embedded in a rotating Gödel universe when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> is set equal to −1.
The imposition of a particular gauge condition in a non-Abelian gauge theory may lead to large-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> nonuniformities in an amplitude expansion when used in the construction of an approximate solution of the field equations of the theory. We show that for both the Yang-Mills theory and general relativity it is always possible to find a class of gauge conditions that do not suffer from this defect and at the same time lead to solvable equations in each order of the approximation employed. We further show how one can construct such gauge conditions by a method similar to Lighthill's method of strained coordinates. An example of such a construction is given for the Yang-Mills theory.
We discuss a method of determining the form of the hypothetical gravitational Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) replacing the Einsteinian Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> in order to avoid the singularity in cosmological solutions. Instead of supposing some form of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) and then trying to solve the generalized Einstein equations, we treat<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) as an unknown function while inserting the cosmological solution coinciding with Friedmann solution everywhere except for the singularity, which is replaced by a regular minimum of the scale factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> (t) (a regular maximum of curvature). Then we find<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) by numerical integration. The Lagrangians thus obtained for different cases (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0, ± 1, and with the equation of state corresponding to pure radiation) have some common properties, among which ¦f(R)¦ &lt; ¦R¦ (concavity), and the absence of asymptotes.
Evolution of incoherent matter distributions with cylindrical, pseudoplanar, and toroidal symmetries is considered. The system is described in terms of the scale factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a (R, T)</em> and the anisotropy factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω (R, T)</em> of the (x<sup>2</sup>, x<sup>3</sup> surfaces. A number of exact solutions is obtained under the assumptions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(a), ω=ω(R)</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(T)</em> and their physical properties are breifly discussed. In particular, the solution with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(T)</em> is noncollapsing and describes a matter distribution with unchanging density.
For charged dust distributions with spherical, planar, and pseudospherical symmetries the general solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations is presented in quadratures. For zero cosmological constant all the concrete models are listed. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for these models to have no temporal (occurring at a certain moment of proper time) singularities. Properties of planarly symmetric configurations are discussed in more detail. In particular, conditions are formulated for a plane layer to be mirror-symmetric in the thickness direction; it is shown that an external electromagnetic field cannot prevent a neutral matter distribution from evolving to a singularity; it is demonstrated that one of two electrovacuum space-times matched to a physically acceptable plane layer of matter can have a Cauchy horizon while the other has none. Examples of regular mirror-symmetric layers are presented.
The solvability of the Lichnerowicz-York equation is discussed on each slice<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub>=IR<sup>3</sup> of a spacelike, asymptotically Euclidean maximal foliation {<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>τ</sub>}. Following Cantor, the problem is reduced to a discussion of the properties of a smooth, time-dependent, family of conformal transformations,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em><sub>t</sub>, relating the physical metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>t</sub>of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub> to a metric ĥ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em><sup>4</sup>h<sub>t</sub>, with vanishing scalar curvature. An estimate is provided for inf<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em><sub>t</sub>. This allows us to examine the properties of the scale geometry on each<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub>when strong field regions are probed. It is shown that in such regions ĥ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub> tends to become degenerate exponentially as a suitable average of the scalar curvature of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub>, h<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub>) increases. This is interpreted as representing the approach to a singular regime for (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub>, h<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub>). An estimate is also provided for the lapse function-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>t</sub> defining {<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>t</sub>}. This is found to be in agreement with a similar estimate suggested, on heuristic grounds, by Smarr and York. This latter result indicates that asymptotically flat maximal slicings in general (but not always) avoid reaching regions where the above singular regime is approached.
The work of a previous article [1] is extended to show that space-times which are the exact solutions of the field equations for a perfect fluid also may be exact solutions of the field equations for a viscous magnetohydrodynamic fluid. Conditions are found for this equivalence to exist and viscous magnetohydrodynamic solutions are found for a number of known perfect fluid space-times.
A generalization of Einstein's theory is discussed in which the gravitation is described by a tensor and a scalar field. The theory is more consistent with Mach's principle and less reliant on absolute properties of space. The modification involves a violation of the “strong principle of equivalence” on which Einstein's theory is based. In the original version of this new theory, the “constant” of gravitation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is varying and particle masses are fixed. Later on another version of the theory was given in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is truly a constant and the particle masses vary. The two versions are related by a conformal transformation. The physical and mathematical foundations of this theory have been discussed and the field equations have been derived. The astrophysical and cosmological consequences of the theory have been elaborately reviewed.


We present two new alternative representations for the action of an arbitrary number<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> of HKX transformations on an arbitrary Weyl solution. The resulting new class of Ernst potentials depends on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2N</em> real parameters. Applications of the derived representations are shown.
Created particle spectra are calculated in Robertson-Walker universes with scale factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>∝<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>α</sup>(0 &lt;α≦ 1) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a∝e</em><sup>t</sup>, and discussed with a special emphasis on their dependence upon the initial and final times at which a WKB-like positive frequency condition should be imposed. It is shown that the obtained spectra are very sensitive to these times if the WKB approximation for the field equation is not valid in their neighborhood. It is also shown that the total number density of created particles remains finite if the final time is set to be finite.
A family of exact solutions of the Einstein-Liouville equations are presented, in which the space-time geometry is that of a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0 or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=+1 Robertson-Walker space-time but the particle distribution function is anisotropic (and can be inhomogeneous). In some of these solutions, the fluid average (barycentric) velocity is not the timelike eigenvector of the fluid stress tensor. Then a “fundamental observer” moving with the average (barycentric) velocity will not observe these universes to be isotropic.
Synge's approximation method is used in order to obtain the gravitational field of a massive body with an axis of symmetry around which it is rotating steadily. The method is carried out to include the second approximation. This means that terms of order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup> are retained as significant, and there is an error of order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>3</sup> in the field equations,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> being the mass of the body.
It is already known that for an asymptotically flat space-time the metric coefficients and the other Newman-Penrose variables (in a suitable frame) can be constructed, in principle, by specifying certain initial data at conformal null infinity (and one further function on another null hypersurface), integrating the Newman-Penrose equations in the conformally rescaled “unphysical” space, and then transforming the results back to the physical space-time. If this is done approximately near ℐ<sup>+</sup>, for vacuum, the well-known Newman-Unti expansion is obtained. In this paper, after complexifying null infinity ℐ<sup>+</sup> we generate, in a similar fashion, a left-flat space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> using as much of the initial data of a given asymptotically flat space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> as possible, and show that the left-flat space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> thus constructed is, in fact, the H-space corresponding to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M.</em> The advantage of our method is that it allows a reversal of procedure. Under suitable conditions we can generate from a given left-flat space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> a class of physical space-times whose H-space is precisely the given left-flat space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H.</em> We shall see that the formal procedure requires only the local but not the global properties of ℊ<sup>+</sup>.
The question of whether the material distribution in any cosmological model can be interpreted unambiguously is considered. We suggest that the answer is negative, and discuss problems in theoretical cosmology which may arise from this ambiguity of interpretation.
A recently presented method, that permits one to calculate gauge-fixing conditions from a given gauge-breaking term, is applied to internal as well as external Yang-Mills theories. As to the internal case, the known gauge-fixing conditions can easily be reproduced in a unified way. For the external case, i.e., the Poincaré gauge theory of gravitation, new gauge-fixing conditions are obtained, in particular the full nonlinear generalization of the Coulomb and axial gauge. They prove to be simultaneously valid for theories with or without torsion.
We consider a class of theories of gravity in which the motion of test particles is governed by the path equation (with respect to a general affine connection Г). When we restrict attention to a spherically symmetric, static gravitational field, the path equation is characterized by three arbitrary functions of the gravitational field (as opposed to two in the case of metric theories where Г={ }). We find that there are essentially only two constraints on the three functions by appealing to solar system experiments. Therefore, we must supplement the equation of motion with other physical laws to obtain a value for the third arbitrary function (this, of course, is not necessary in the case of metric theories). If we consider theories in which both Г and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> play a physical role we find in certain circumstances that this “third” condition is sufficient to prove that the theories under investigation reduce to their “metric” form.

Three classes of Petrov type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> nonrotating empty spaces, which we denote as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>+</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>−</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span>, can be seen to represent, respectively, a gravitational field of a uniformly accelerating source which moves with velocity slower, faster than, or equal to that of light. The first two classes of space-time,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>+</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>−</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span>, approach to the last one,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span>, as the acceleration becomes greater and greater. The inertial frame in a flat space-time, relative to which a faster-thanlight particle moving along a spacelike geodesic behaves as an ordinary particle, is given and discussed. The behaviors of Killing horizons in the classes,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>+</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub>−</sub> <sup>*</sup> </span> are investigated. Comparisons are made between the analysis by Farhoosh and Zimmerman and ours. Our identification of the acceleration parameter seems to be more appropriate than that by the above authors.
The power spectrum of radiation of gravitons which are emitted by the binary system represented by two point masses moving around each other under their mutual gravitational interaction is calculated in the Schwinger source theory version of quantum gravity. The calculation is applied to the zero eccentricity of the orbits but arbitrary orbital nonrelativistic velocity.
The so-called normal coordinates where derivatives of the metric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub>µ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> are expressed through the curvature tensor and its derivatives, are constructed along a geodesic. Explicit expressions for the derivatives of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub>µ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> up to the fourth order are presented and recursive relations permitting a simple calculation of the higher derivatives are found.
A method is presented which reduces the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt field equations for a stationary axisymmetric electrovac space-time, to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In this formalism the solution generation technique of Singh and Rai for Brans-Dicke theory yields a particular class of solutions, for which the conformal scalar field depends upon the radial coordinate only. As an application of the method, new cylindrically symmetric and nonstatic scalar-Maxwell solutions are obtained for null and non-null electromagnetic fields.
Using the notion of Galilei manifolds a geometric formulation of the cosmological principle for the prerelativistic theory of gravitation is presented. This is applied to a generalization of the Newton-Cartan theory which admits solutions with a curved Galilei structure. Furthermore, the limit relation between this theory and some relativistic theories is discussed.
An exact Bianchi type-V vacuum solution is presented corresponding to which the equations of motion are solved exactly for the coordinates of the null geodesics.
A well-known difficulty associated with the conformal method for the solution of the general relativistic Hamiltonian constraint is the appearance of an aphysical “bag of gold” singularity at the nodal surfaces of the conformal factor. This happens whenever the background Ricci scalar is too large. Using a simple model we demonstrate that some of these singular solutions do have a physical meaning, and that these can be considered as initial data for Universes containing black holes, which are connected, in a conformally nonsingular way with each other. The relation between the ADM mass and the horizon area in this solution supports the cosmic censorship conjecture.
In a recent paper it was shown how to construct, under certain circumstances, asymptotic (Newman-Unti) series expansions for the spin-coefficient variables for real space-times from data obtained from a given left-flat space in an appropriate frame. If these expansions represent asymptotically flat space-times the latter have the given left-flat space as their H space. The method was described in a frame in which the asymptotic left-shear <span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\widehat\sigma ^0 \)</span> was zero whereas <span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\widehat{\tilde \sigma }^0 \)</span> was not. For the discussion of algebraically special left-flat spaces it is more convenient to have <span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\widehat{\tilde \sigma }^0 \)</span> vanish and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\widehat\sigma ^0 \)</span> remain nonzero. In this paper we determine all algebraically special left-flat spaces with diverging rays, utilizing Penrose's conformal technique, and then show in detail how to find the “initial data” for the construction of asymptotic series expansions for the corresponding real space-times.
Static axially symmetric solutions in vacuum are obtained in the general scalar-tensor theory proposed by Nordtvedt. The solutions are asymptotically flat and under certain conditions give very large red shift. The asymptotic behavior and singularity are studied and a comparison is made with a corresponding solution with spherical symmetry. It is also observed that with a conformal transformation the Nordtvedt metric appears to reduce to the Brans-Dicke one.
The Truesdell transport of a contravariant tensor field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>is defined with respect to a time-like vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>analogous to the classical definition in continuum mechanics. Truesdell stress rate of the shear tensor (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em><sup>ab</sup>) and the metric tensor (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>) is Truesdell transported along<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub>if and only if the medium is rigid. In case of two-dimensional projection operators<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">*ab</em> </sup>are Truesdell transported along timelike vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>if and only if they are expansion free (along<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>) with<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\tau = \lambda - \bar \sigma + \mu - \rho = 0\)</span>. A collapsing perfect fluid is Truesdell transported with respect to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>if and only if it is expansion free (along<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>), energy density (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>), pressure (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>), and density of neutrino radiation (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>) are conserved along<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σt=λ</em>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\alpha + \bar \beta = \tau = 0\)</span>. In all the above cases, analogous results are found along<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>using freedom conditions (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k=ε=π=γ+γ</em><sup>−</sup>=0) as null rays are always restricted to be geodesic (Carter [1]).
We make an alternative approach to Bonnorification by making use of effective Lagrangians for the gravitational fields. Using this technique we obtain a new Einstein-Maxwell solution.
The results obtained from an analysis of the wave zone of the Zerilli equation by Anderson, Kates, Kegeles, and Madonna are reviewed. An asymptotic gauge transformation is then developed in order to transform the metric from Regge-Wheeler gauge to Chandrasekhar and Esposito gauge, through the first post-Newtonian (PN) order. The transformation is carried out and the transformed wave zone metric is matched to the Chandrasekhar-Esposito (CE) metric.
The Jordan-Brans-Dicke field equations [1] contain the four-dimensional field equations of the five-dimensional projective unified theory. As it should be, Einstein's theory is incorporated as a limiting case. In this paper we present a method to determine explicitly for every static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's theory with perfect fluid an analogous solution of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. As a particular example a “generalized interior Schwarzschild solution” is given.
Hawking and Wald have recently argued that the process of quantum black hole evaporation requires the violation of the fundamental physical law which asserts that the time evolution of quantum states is governed by unitary operators. I show this violation can be avoided by a change in the global boundary conditions. It is remotely possible that astronomical observation could establish whether or not the universe has these boundary conditions in which quantum mechanical time evolution is governed by unitary operators.
Two criteria to find the good vacuum in a curved space-time are studied. In a generic Robertson-Walker universe they are not coincident; yielding to the well-known ambiguity in the vacuum definition. In few cases they coincide and give well-established vacua. An approximate vacuum is introduced in intermediate situations.
The concept of a spinor structure at spacelike infinity is introduced for space-times which are asymptotically flat. It is shown how zero-rest-mass fields on space-time acquire smooth limits on this structure and that these limits satisfy certain differential equations characterized by the helicity and regularity of the field. The geometry of the limits of twistor fields is also discussed, and it seems possible that one can define the momentum and angular momentum of an asymptotically flat space-time in terms of a twistor space at spacelike infinity.
A method is described for unfolding the singularities in superspace,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathcal{G} = \mathfrak{M}/\mathfrak{D}\)</span>, the space of Riemannian geometries of a manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. This unfolded superspace is described by the projection</p><div class="Para"> <div id="E1" class="Equation EquationMathjax"><div class="EquationContent">$$\mathcal{G}_{F\left( M \right)} = \frac{{\mathfrak{M} \times F\left( M \right)}}{\mathfrak{D}} \to \frac{\mathfrak{M}}{\mathfrak{D}} = \mathcal{G}$$</div></div> </div><p class="Para">where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(M)</em> is the frame bundle of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. The unfolded space<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\mathcal{G}_{F\left( M \right)}\)</span> is infinite-dimensional manifold without singularities. Moreover, as expected, the unfolding of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\mathcal{G}_{F\left( M \right)}\)</span> at each geometry [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>o</sub>] ∈<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is parameterized by the isometry group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ig</em><sub>o</sub> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>) of g<sub>0</sub>. Our construction is natural, is generally covariant with respect to all coordinate transformations, and gives the necessary information at each geometry to make<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE5">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> a manifold. This construction is a canonical and geometric model of a nonrelativistic construction that unfolds superspace by restricting to those coordinate transformations that fix a frame at a point. These particular unfoldings are tied together by an infinite-dimensional fiber bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> over<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, associated with the frame bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(M)</em>, with standard fiber<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE6">\(\mathcal{G}_{F\left( M \right)}\)</span>, and with fiber at a point in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> being the particular noncanonical unfolding of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE7">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> based at that point. Thus<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> is the totality of all the particular unfoldings, and so is a grand unfolding of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE8">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>.


The Truesdell derivative of a contravariant tensor field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>is defined with respect to a null congruence<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>analogous to the Truesdell stress rate in classical continuum mechanics. The dynamical consequences of the Truesdell invariance with respect to a timelike vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>of the stress-energy tensor characterizing a charged perfect fluid with null conductivity are the conservation of pressure (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>), charged density (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>) an expansion-free flow, constancy of the Maxwell scalars, and vanishing spin coefficients<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α+¯β = ¯σ − λ = τ</em> = 0 (assuming freedom conditions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k = λ = ε ψ + ¯γ</em> = 0). The electromagnetic energy momentum tensor for the special subcases of Ruse-Synge classification for types<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> are described in terms of the spin coefficients introduced by Newman-Penrose.
We construct a solution of Einstein's field equations with a possible astrophysical interest by matching a Vaidya solution with another Vaidya solution through a thin spherical shell of radially radiating matter. We study the system of equations for the motion of the shell and the radiation fields in two simple cases. In one of them we consider a dust shell of constant proper mass radiating at constant rate. In the other case we restrict the motion of the shell to a stationary configuration and assume it to be totally opaque. We find that this later solution is unstable under small perturbations in the radius of the shell but there exist stable stationary solutions if the pressure within the shell is different from zero.
The gravitational nonradiative collapse of dust configurations in the presence of electromagnetic field is analyzed in terms of exact dynamical solutions for a wide range of spacetime symmetries: cylindrical, pseudoplanar, toroidal, and also spherical, planar, and pseudospherical [when the anisotropy factor of the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>2</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>3</sup>) surfaces,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>(R, T), is replaced by a massless scalar field]. The condition that the collapse is nonradiative leaves three possibilities for the coordinate dependence of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω(R,T)</em>∶ (i)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(a),a (R, T)</em> being the scale factor of the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>2</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>3</sup>) surfaces, (ii)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(T)</em>, and (iii)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(R)</em>. Almost all (in the meaning indicated in the text) solutions for charged dust with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(a)</em> and for dust in the external electromagnetic field with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(T)</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω=ω(R)</em> have been obtained and discussed. A wideranging discussion concerning the topics of papers I–III is given. Special attention is paid to the question of horizon existence and formation and also the perspective of extension of the techniques developed onto the more realistic case of axial symmetry.
A new class of gravitational effects, in the quantum interference of charged particles, are studied in electron interferometry and superconducting Josephson interferometry. These include phase shifts due to the gravitationally induced Schiff-Barnhill field, rotationally induced London moment, and the modification of the Aharonov-Bohm type of phase shifts, due to the general relativistic coupling of the electromagnetic field to the gravitational field. These effects are interesting, even from a purely theoretical point of view, because they involve an elegant interplay between gravitation, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. But new predictions are also made which, if confirmed, would provide the first observation of relativistic gravitational effects, involving the electric charge, at the quantum mechanical level. The possibility of using these effects to detect gravitational waves is also discussed.
We study the positions of orbits around a Kerr black hole with respect to its ergosphere. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r−σ</em> motions of zero-energy (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>=0) null geodesies are inside truncated circular sectors, whose outer corners are on the static limit. Timelike geodesies with the same constants of motion are restricted inside a smaller area. For certain parameter values there are also orbits inside the inner horizon not reaching the center. Then we study the various types of orbits on the plane of symmetry for all the values of the angular momentum of the black hole 0⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>⩽<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and of the angular momentum of the photons, or particles,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>, and for all the values of the energy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>. In particular we find the possible positions of the turning points with respect to the ergosphere. A restriction imposed by physical considerations is that the coordinate time increases when the proper time increases. This allows us to distinguish between positive and negative energy orbits. All negative energy orbits enter the horizon of the black hole.
The previous formulation of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> rank 0 HKX transformations by means of determinants is revisited. The new expressions for the metric functions permit the limits which yield the rank<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> transformations. As an instance we give the Ernst potential for such transformations acting on flat space.
It is shown that if the sectional (Riemannian) curvature function is given at all spacetime points, then, apart from a very special class of space-times, the metric is uniquely determined.
We consider the influence of a plane gravitational wave on the following Newtonian system: a self-gravitating elastic sphere without rotation. We determine the equation governing the elastic oscillations within the framework of the general relativity. We include dissipative processes by using a simple relativistic model of viscoelasticity. If the wavelength is much larger than the dimension of the elastic sphere, we transform these equations into the form derived by Ashby and Dreitlein previously. We also determine the equations governing the elastic oscillations within the framework of the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory of gravitation.
A new method of calculation is given for arbitrary tensors in Riemann normal coordinates. Inventing a compact notation for an abstract form of tensors which is suitable to a noncommutative algebra system, we carry out the computer calculations to obtain coefficients of the Taylor expansion of tensors in Riemann normal coordinates. Explicit forms are given up to the tenth order for the metric tensor.
The cross section for the scattering of light by the Ellis geometry, with the two asymptotically flat regions observationally identified, is computed in the geometrical optics approximation.
The theory of black holes developed by Hawking in asymptotically flat space-times is generalized so that black holes in the cosmological situations are included. It is assumed that the strong version of the Penrose cosmic censorship hypothesis holds.
An ansatz is given which reduces the equations of sourceless (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n+p</em>)-dimensional general relativity to those of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional general relativity coupled to a repulsive<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O(p)</em> scalar field. Regular solutions are obtained for (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=3,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=3,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=2), and (n=3, p=4). All these solutions have the wormhole topology.
In this paper we prove that if there is a naked singularity, then there will be some null geodesic, reaching ℐ<sup>+</sup> from the singularity, which does not satisfy the strong curvature condition regardless of whether causality is violated or not. Assuming that a naked singularity is a strong curvature singularity only sufficiently far to the future, we prove that strong causality is violated arbitrarily close to ℐ<sup>+</sup>.
A modification to the Lindstedt-Poincaré method of strained parameters is applied to the differential equation of the orbit of a test particle in the Schwarzschild exterior metric. A new perturbation solution for the equation of the bound orbit, which is completely free of secular terms in the angular coordinate, is derived. The precession of the orbit per revolution is calculated using this solution and it is found to give a more accurate result than existing perturbation solutions. The method should be applicable to similar orbital problems in general relativity.
Null solutions of the geodesic equation are presented for a universe which can be regarded as a rotating and shearing generalization of the static Einstein universe (the Ozsváth class I model). It is shown how the closest caustic, which in the static case just consists of one point at the antipode, grows to form two interwoven closed surfaces when motion is introduced. It is further shown how they prevent causality violating null-like curves. The observed transversal motion of matter (the global rotation) is calculated. The conclusions concerning the causality of the universe which an observer might draw from the global rotation are discussed.
It is shown that censorship is a consequence of a condition which requires only the absence of naked singularities of less than a certain finite strength.
There is considerable interest currently in theories of gravity where rest masses vary slowly with time. A new theory of this type is proposed which is believed to be superior to others, and which contains Einstein's theory embedded within it. The theory is five dimensional, where the extra coordinate is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>4</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gm</em>/c<sup>2</sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is the Newtonian gravitational parameter,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> the velocity of light, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> the mass). The theory reduces to Einstein's if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>=(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/c</em><sup>3</sup>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dm/d</em>t=0 and the fifth dimension is absent. The theory agrees with observation provided<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>≪1, but the size of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> in the real world can only be determined by experiment.
I conjecture, and show for a large class of cases, that given a spacelike hypersurface on which is an arbitrary distribution of linearized gravitons and matter, the latter satisfying the positive energy condition, the expectation value of the number of events in which a graviton is absorbed by or scattered inelastically from the matter within any future time,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>, is always less then the expectation value of the number of gravitons in the initial state (except for a set of initial configurations of measure zero). Consequences of this result are: (1) the impossibility of any system containing gravitational radiation reaching thermal equilibrium in a finite time, (2) the absence of an ultraviolet catastrophe for gravitational radiation, (3) the impossibility of measuring accurately the quantum state of the linearized gravitational field, and (4) the impossibility of constructing a gravitational wave laser.
A theorem is proven that the only possible exterior solution for a pseudostationary, rotating, electrovacuum black hole with nondegenerate event horizon is the Kerr-Newman solution with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sup>2</sup>-J<sup>2</sup>/M<sup>2</sup>-Q<sup>2</sup>&gt;0. A special role played in the proof of this theorem by the hidden symmetry group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(1, 2) of Einstein's equations is established.
We study nonviscous and viscous fluids in Bianchi types II, VIII, and IX space-times under the restriction that the ratio of shear to expansion be constant.
Within the framework of the previous paper, we complete the set of equations of motion by including the spin propagation equation at first order. We check this equation with the known result on the precession, which is obtained by means of slow motion approximation of our result. A new scheme of expanding equations of motion is also introduced. It will be useful to undertake higher-order calculations.
General relativity is formulated for a (2+1)-dimensional space-time. Solutions to the vacuum field equations are locally flat. There are no gravitational waves and no Newtonian attraction between masses. The geometry around a point mass is a cone (locally flat) where the angle deficit at the apex is proportional to the mass. A uniform density planet has a spherical cap interior and a conical exterior solution. A convex polyhedron represents a closed universe with point masses at its vertices and approximates a static spherical universe of uniform density dust.
We present the full four-dimensional metric for a stationary axisymmetric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations related to the Ernst potential which we obtain by application of an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">arbitrary</em> number of rank-zero HKX transformations to the general static Weyl solution. The metric function ω is determined in a completely algebraically way. We perform a suitable Ehlers transformation to ensure asymptotic flatness and give the expression for the total mass of this asymptotically flat solution by analyzing the behavior of the solution on the positive z axis.
The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>-metric with parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> = 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> ≠ 0 is transformed to Weyl form; the sources then appear as a spherical cap of charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>, and an uncharged semi-infinite line mass. Next, the Weyl metric is enlarged by a further transformation. The enlarged space-time has as its source two uniformly accelerated charged caps. In an appropriate approximation, the electromagnetic field components of this solution are identical to those of the Born solution of classical electrodynamics.
The concept of conformai dynamical symmetry (CDS) is introduced as a basic tool for the analysis of null geodesic motion. CDSs are characterized as generators of Jacobi fields along null geodesies. Methods for the construction of CDS's based on the connections between CDSs and conformai Killing tensors or on the behavior of CDSs under conformai transformations are then discussed. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of conserved quantities canonically related to CDSs is given.
We find the most general form of a scalar density concomitant of a metric tensor and a bivector. This, together with previous theorems, gives a complete characterization of the tensor concomitants of a metric and a bivector.
The paper studies the vorticity- and shear-free nonstatic space-times with perfect fluid source in genera] relativity and finds that such space-times are either spherically symmetric or pseudospherical or plane symmetric.
It is shown that Minkowski space is unstable in the context of semiclassical gravity. There exists a threshold mass, of the quantized matter field, which marks the dividing line between stable and unstable vacuum fluctuations of matter in flat space-time. The Minkowski vacuum gravitational-matter system undergoes a phase transition above this “critical point,” the new phase being a self-consistently generated de Sitter Euclidean cosmology. Its total energy is degenerate with respect to that of empty Minkowski space-time. It represents an appropriate candidate for the primeval configuration of an inflationarylike universe.
A new general relativistic many-body effect is described. It results in an unexpectedly large relative acceleration between neighboring test particles that follow an inclined orbit about a rotating mass. The effect vanishes if the orbit coincides with the equatorial plane of the rotating mass. The existence of this effect is due to a small divisor involving the deviation of the orbital frequency measured by a comoving clock from the frequency measured by an inertial clock. The influence of the rotation of the Sun on the Earth-Moon system is investigated, and it is shown that the new effect causes a harmonic variation in the Earth-Moon separation with an amplitude of order 1 m and dominant periods of 18.6 yr, ∼1/2 yr, 1 month, and ∼1/2 month. The confirmation of these results by the lunar laser ranging experiment would provide a significant new test of general relativity and a measurement of the angular momentum of the Sun.
The nonstationary generalization of the Gödel cosmological model, which represents the solution of Einstein's equations in the comoving system of reference, is derived, and some properties of the new model are investigated.
The adiabatic particle definition of Parker [1] has only been discussed for particular choices of the field variable and time coordinate, referred to here as the choice of a normal-form. It seems to have been implicitly assumed that the associated vacuum is independent of the normal-form chosen; we show that this is indeed the case.
The role of the Bargmann group (11-dimensional extended Galilei group) in nonrelativistic gravitation theory is investigated. The generalized Newtonian gravitation theory (Newton-Cartan theory) achieves the status of a gauge theory about as much as general relativity and couples minimally to a complex scalar field leading to a four-dimensionally covariant Schrödinger equation. Matter current and stress-energy tensor follow correctly from the Lagrangian. This theory on curved Newtonian space-time is also shown to be a limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory.
Necessary and sufficient conditions that a cylindrical, symmetric line element may be of class one have been derived in terms of metrical quantities. The conditions so obtained have been compared with those in the cases of spherical, planar, and hyperbolic symmetries.
The field equations of general relativity are solved to describe a gravitational field due to a rotating homogeneous fluid in the presence of a Maxwellian source-free electromagnetic field. It turns out that the metric to describe this field is the well-known Robertson-Walker metric with positive space-time curvature or its particular case, the metric of the closed Einstein universe.
A theory of black holes is developed under the assumption of the weak cosmic censorship. It includes Hawking's theory of black holes in the future asymptotically predictable spacetimes as a special case but it also applies to the cosmological situations including models with nonzero cosmological constant of both signs.
Banerjee and Andrade generated axially symmetric electrovac solutions from the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordström solution by giving a complex translation along the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em> axis. We use the same method for generating new more complicated axially symmetric solutions from known solutions. Several such examples are given.
Faulkes has shown that shear-free solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations can be found by solving a single second-order nonlinear differential equation containing two arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate. In this work a very general method is proposed to solve this nonlinear equation which, in effect, extends an earlier work of Wyman to its electromagnetic analog.
Matter tensor and motion of a test body is obtained. The test body is an oscillating bar; the background metric is a Bondi plane wave. Amplitude and frequency of bar and wave are arbitrary and not necessarily constant.
The Segal Chronometric theory is examined, with particular attention given to the role of a physical measurement in the theory. A calculation of the red shift in Segal's theory in the geometrical optics limit yields the result<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>=0, in contradiction to Segal's result<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>=tan<sup>2</sup> (α/2), and the disagreement is shown to arise from the unphysical nature of Segal's theory of measurement. An argument is also presented to show that the postulates on which Segal's theory is based are inconsistent when massive particles are introduced into the Segal universe.

The uniform motion of the center of mass of a charged, conducting fluid, in the presence of an electromagnetic field, is derived in the first post-Newtonian approximation of general relativity. Also the source's far field metric tensor is determined, and it is expressed in terms of parameters known as three-dimensional volume integrals over its interior. These results for the above system permit the physical identification, to post-Newtonian accuracy, of the integration constants and the coordinate systems involved in the Schwarzschild and the Kerr metric tensors.
All type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum (nonnull orbit and null orbit) solutions with λ are exhibited in canonical coordinates. The nonnull orbit metrics with λ contain four families of solutions: the static Levi-Cività metrics, the nondiverging<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>'s, the diverging<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>'s, and the diverging and twisting solutions. The null orbit metrics subdivide into two subclasses of solutions: the divergenceless null orbit<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>'s, and the diverging and twisting null orbit solution.
The analysis of the admissibility of a potential representation for the Riemann tensor is here continued. As in the preceding paper, the starting point is to regard the relationship between the Riemann tensor and its possible potential as a system of partial differential equations determining the unknown potential. The first result, strengthening a previous conclusion, is that there never exist ordinary solutions. Surprisingly enough, in a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold the existence of singular solutions is established without requiring any integrability condition. Possible applications and generalizations are also suggested.
The three-surface twistor equation is defined for an arbitrary three-surface Σ in an arbitrary curved space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M.</em> It is proved that three-surface twistors exist on 2 if and only if Σ can be embedded in a conformally flat space-time with the same first and second fundamental forms.
Using static spherically symmetric space-times with associated 3-spaces obtained as hypersurfaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>= const as 3-spheroidal, a class of physically viable relativistic models for spherical distributions of uniformly charged dust in equilibrium is obtained. The charged analog of Schwarzschild interior solution given by Cooperstock and de la Cruz follows as a particular case of this class.
The adiabatic particle definition of Parker [1] has found widespread acceptance (see, e.g., [2]) in the semiclassical approach to quantum gravity. We give sufficient conditions on a space-time so that, using the adiabatic particle definition, exactly zero particles are created; for these space-times the adiabatic vacuum is stable. The difficulties in formulating necessary conditions are discussed.
In recent years there have been many authors that have sought a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">geometrically</em> unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism. It will be argued that the motivation behind the search for such a unified theory on geometric grounds alone is both erroneous and misleading. It is felt that any new unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism must include an explanation of why the existing theory is inadequate, and should provide clear physical reasons for introducing new fields (or field equations) that appear in the theory.
For stationary, asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein's equations, covariant functionals of the metric variables are defined which characterize the Kerr metric uniquely. For instance, we obtain a generalization of the “Bach tensor” to stationary metrics, which vanishes if and only if the solution is Kerr. We also give a new interpretation of the “Schwarzschild-to-Kerr-transformation.” Our results might be applicable to simplify the proof of the uniqueness theorem for stationary black holes.
A class of regular, asymptotically flat solutions to the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with a two-parameter Abelian isometry group is constructed, under the additional assumption of axial symmetry in three-dimensional space. The possibility of interpreting these multiwormhole solutions as multiparticle systems is discussed.
The regular multiwormhole solutions to the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations, previously obtained, are generalized to massive solutions, interpreted as systems of extended particles.
In General Relativity, one has several traditional ways of interpreting the curvature of spacetime, expressed either through the curvature tensor or the sectional curvature function. This essay asks what happens if curvature is treated on a more primitive level, that is, if the curvature is prescribed, what information does one have about the metric and associated connection of space-time? It turns out that a surprising amount of information is available, not only about the metric and connection, but also, through Einstein's equations, about the algebraic structure of the energy-momentum tensor.
We use a particular tetrad field to describe homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in the background of Møller's theory of gravitation. We prove that the universe can be closed or open for any possible value of the density of energy. The relation between the apparent magnitude<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and the number of galaxies with a magnitude greater than<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> is proved to be different from that of general relativity.
In the framework of a space-time theory of gravitation a variational principle is set up for the gravitational field equations and the equations of motion of matter. The general framework leads to Newton's equations of motion with an unspecified force term and, for irrotational motion, to a restriction on the propagation of the shear tensor along the streamlines of matter. The field equations obtained from the variation are weaker than the standard field equations of Newton-Cartan theory. An application to fluids with shear and bulk viscosity is given.
We study the homogeneous and isotropic solutions of a gravitational theory with scalar fields. Qualitative characteristics of these solutions are analyzed and important differences with respect to the usual Einstein theory are pointed out.
We present a new generalized solution of Maxwell-Einstein equations (which are nonminimally coupled) which leads to some fascinating aspects of the Universe. The Cosmos has no singularity due to the coupling of longitudinal electromagnetism with space-time. It contains the Milne-Schucking cosmos as a limiting case. Our model contains a free parameter (the longitudinal electromagnetic field) which allows one to fix the density of highest compression of the Cosmos. Alternatively the parameter allows one to adjust our cosmos to the presently observed Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter. The model seems to be a viable candidate for our real cosmos as it allows one to extend the time scale of the Universe to arbitrarily large values, i.e., it is able to provide the necessary time scale for the origin of life. We speculate that the entropy is finite but intelligence in the Universe may be infinite.
The timelike vortical geodesies of the Kerr metric are integrated numerically in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r-θ</em> subspace of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We find that the trajectories, under physically reasonable conditions, are essentially conical (in the sense of constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em>). This behavior is not that which one would infer from previous qualitative discussions.
By introducing imaginary Weyl coordinates the Kerr geometry can be described by the Weyl coordinate system as good as the Boyer-Lindquist system.
The Hawking criterion for the stability of thermodynamical equilibrium between a Schwarzschild black hole and its own radiation is refined by the use of Page's expression for the renormalized stress-energy tensor.
Using the canonical forms for symmetric tensors in Minkowski space and the Petrov forms of the Weyl tensor, algebraic relationships between the two kinds of classification are developed for empty space-times of embedding class two.
The problem investigated is that of two Schwarzschild black holes of masses<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>1</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>2</sub>≪<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>1</sub>, which are initially at rest on a time-symmetric spacelike hypersurface. An asymptotic formula as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>2</sub>→0 is found for the maximum separation between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>1</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>2</sub> such that a connected component of the apparent horizon encloses both<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>1</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sub>2</sub>. The problem is solved numerically.
The method of calculating radiation damping effects by means of energy balance is applied to a simple model problem. The balance equation is derived from the conservation law for energy that is a consequence of the equations of motion for the system by integrating over a four-dimensional space-time region bounded in the wave zone by two future-directed null cones and in the near zone by two<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=const surfaces. It is assumed that the sources are in slow motion and the fields are calculated by the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Our principle conclusion is that even though the damping is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O(ε</em><sup>3</sup>) where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> is an expansion parameter the fields need only be determined to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(1) to calculate the effects of damping by this method.

The evolution of a class of exact spatially homogeneous cosmological models of Bianchi type VI<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> is discussed. It is known that solutions of type VI<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> cannot approach isotropy asymptotically at large times. Indeed the present class of solutions become asymptotic to an anisotropic vacuum plane wave solution. Nevertheless, for these solutions the initial anisotropy can decay, leading to a stage of finite duration in which the model is close to isotropy. Depending on the choice of parameters in the solution, this quasi-isotropic stage can commence at the initial singularity, in which case the singularity is of the type known as “isotropic” or “Friedmann-like.” The existence of this quasi-isotropic stage implies that these models can be compatible in principle with the observed universe.
Using the idea of metric scaling we examine the scaling behavior of the stress tensor of a scalar quantum field in curved space-time. The renormalization of the stress tensor results in a departure from naive scaling. We view the process of renormalizing the stress tensor as being equivalent to renormalizing the coupling constants in the Lagrangian for gravity (with terms quadratic in the curvature included). Thus the scaling of the stress tensor is interpreted as a nonnaive scaling of these coupling constants. In particular, we find that the cosmological constant and the gravitational constant approach UV fixed points. The constants associated with the terms which are quadratic in the curvature logarithmically diverge. This suggests that quantum gravity is asymptotically scale invariant.
In five-dimensional relativity theory of Kaluza-Klein the projection of the 5-geodesic equation is discussed in detail. The scalar occurring within this framework is first assumed to be variable. A simple classification of 5-geodesics is found and pictured with the help of a deformed 5-cone. On the assumption that the scalar is constant the 5-geodesic equation yields the Lorentz equation of motion for a charged particle. Intrinsic mass and intrinsic charge are introduced as new particle parameters. Mass and charge formulas are proposed.
We investigate the structure of the so-called power asymptote singularities in orthogonal spatially homogeneous solutions of the Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source. We first give a systematic survey of the different possible power asymptotes, some of which are well known, and some new, and characterize them in a coordinate-independent manner. The known orthogonal spatially homogeneous exact solutions with perfect fluid source are then classified on the basis of which power asymptote they admit. In many cases this leads to simpler forms of the known solutions, and suggests methods for deriving new solutions.
The metric connection on a space-time manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> defines on its tangent bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TM</em> a distribution of subspaces complementary to the vertical subspaces and therefore called horizontal. We give a formula for the Lie derivative with respect to the geodesic spray of the tensor field on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TM</em> which defines projection onto the vertical subspace along the horizontal subspace; and we show that this formula is a universal version of the equation, for a geodesic local vector field on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, whose trace is Raychaudhuri's equation.
Lyapunov's second method is applied to the spherical radiative Robinson-Trautman vacuum space-times to prove that they asymptotically settle down to Schwarzschild space-time. This class of Robinson-Trautman metrics is characterized by the surface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> being topologically a two-sphere, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> is invariantly defined by the intersection of the hypersurfaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em>=const and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=const. It is shown that ∝<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dσ</em> is a Lyapunov functional, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> is the Gaussian curvature and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dσ</em> is the invariant measure on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>. The critical point occurs at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>=0 or, equivalently, at ð<sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>=0, which condition is shown to characterize Schwarzschild space-time.

A family of plane symmetric models is obtained for a mixture of electrons, protons, and photons expanding in thermal equilibrium, characterized by two independent parameters: the initial photon/baryon number ratio in the universe and the anisotropy parameter.
The purpose of this work is to provide a critical analysis of the classical papers of H. Thirring [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Phys. Z.</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">19</strong>, 33 (1918);<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Phys. Z.</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">22</strong>, 29 (1921)] and J. Lense and H. Thirring [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Phys. Z.</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">19</strong>, 156 (1918)] on rotating masses in the relativistic theory of gravitation and to render them accessible to a wider circle of scholars. An English translation of these papers is presented which follows the original German text as closely as possible. This is followed by a concise account of the significance of the results of these papers as well as the possibility of measuring the gravitational effects of rotating masses.
As a preparation for studying quantum models, we analyze unusual features of Einstein's theory of gravitation in a three-dimensional space-time. In three dimensions, matter curves space-time only locally and the gravitational field has no dynamical degrees of freedom. The standard correspondence of Einstein's theory with Newton's theory breaks down. A dust distribution moves without any geodesic deviation between the particles. The cosmological models and relativistic stars behave in a qualitatively different way from their Newtonian counterparts. These features are important for the correct understanding of mini-superspace models.
A model for a time-dependent relativistic “gas” sphere is given. Both pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> are positive inside the outer boundary of the sphere, and they both drop to zero at the boundary itself. Their respective gradients are negative. For expanding models the pressure and the density are decreasing, and for contracting models the pressure and the density are increasing. The adiabatic sound speed is thus real, and for the layers close to the surface of the sphere it is found that the adiabatic sound speed is less than the speed of light. For these layers the condition<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>&gt;3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> is also fulfilled. However, the area 4π<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup> for a sphere of constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> is not an increasing function of comoving radial coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>.
The extreme Reissner-Nordström geometry is shown to be conformally invariant under a spatial inversion. Generalization of this result to other geometries is briefly discussed.


It is shown that for every one-sided type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> gravitational instanton, Einstein's vacuum equations can be reduced locally to a single second-order, nonlinear differential equation of second degree of one real function.
In recent years, following an earlier result of C. Lanczos concerning the representation of the Weyl tensor in arbitrary space-times, it has been conjectured that the Riemann tensor itself admits a linear representation in terms of the covariant derivatives of a suitable “potential” tensor of rank 3. This conjecture is shown to be false, at least for a class of spacetime geometries including several physically significant ones.
Riemannian space-times with self-dual curvature and which admit at least one Killing vector field (stationary) are examined. Such space-times can be classified according to whether a certain scalar field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> (which is the difference between the Newtonian and NUT potentials) reduces to a constant or not. In the former category (called here KSD) are the multi-TaubNUT and multi-instanton space-times. Nontrivial examples of the latter category have yet to be discovered. It is proved here that the static self-dual metrics are flat. It is also proved that each stationary metric for which the Newtonian and nut potentials are functionally related admits a Killing vector field relative to which the metric is KSD. It has also been proved that the regularity of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> field everywhere implies that the metric is KSD. Finally it is proved that for non-KSD space-times every regular compact level surface of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> field encloses the total NUT charge, which must be proportional to the Euler number of the surface.
A procedure for obtaining solutions to Dirac's equation in algebraically special space-times which admit a shear-free congruence of null geodesies along the repeated principal null direction of the Weyl tensor, is presented. By aligning one of the Dirac spinors to the congruence the problem is reduced to solving one second-order linear partial differential equation for a scalar potential. The solution of the massless field equations for null fields of arbitrary spin s&gt;1/2 aligned to the congruence is also given.
We search for vacuum solutions of a spherically symmetric and static field for the nineparameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R+R</em><sup>2</sup> gravitational theories in a weak-field limit. In this paper approximate solutions of torsion are obtained.
There are series solutions for characteristic boundary value problems for fields on black hole backgrounds that converge when the data are given on ℋ=ℋ<sup>−</sup> ∪ ℋ<sup>+</sup>, or on ℐ=ℐ<sup>−</sup> ∪ ℐ<sup>+</sup>, but may not converge when the data are given on ℋ<sup>−</sup> ∪ ℐ<sup>−</sup>, or on ℐ<sup>+</sup> ∪ ℐ<sup>+</sup>. We specialize to oscillatory data of frequency ω and calculate approximate reflection and transmission coefficients<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R(ω)</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T(ω)</em>, using a field generated by data on ℋ=ℋ<sup>−</sup> ∪ ℋ<sup>+</sup>, and again, using a field generated by data on ℋ<sup>−</sup> ∪ ℐ<sup>−</sup>. The first calculation gives qualitatively good results at all frequencies at each order of approximation, and quantitatively better results at higher orders of approximation; the second calculation, using the series which may not converge, gives bad results except at very high frequencies. Thus for the physically unnatural case of a field that vanishes on ℋ<sup>−</sup> and goes to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iωv</em> </sup> on ℋ<sup>+</sup> we have a series that is convergent, and uniformly so with respect to frequency, while for the natural case of a field that vanishes on ℋ<sup>−</sup> and goes to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iωv</em> </sup> on ℐ<sup>−</sup> we are limited to high frequencies. It is argued that a frequency-dependent renormalization of a series of the first type provides an approximation scheme that is convergent, and uniformly so with respect to frequency, for the physically important problems of the second type. The difficulties posed by the ω-dependent renormalization for the study of incident pulses are discussed.
The desirability and possibility to generalize space-time structure to non-Euclidean spaces is investigated. To this end, the two basic notions of inertial motion and relativity are revealed. Several relevant statements about kinematics on spaces of constant curvature are pointed out.
A dynamical system with Robertson-Walker symmetries and the equation of the state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=γ∈, 0≤γ≤1, considered both as a conservative and nonconservative system, is studied with respect to its structural stability properties. Different cases are shown and analyzed on the phase space (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x=R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sup>, y=x).

Galilean space-time is characterized in an axiomatic manner within a certain class of fiber bundles over the time axis IR. The distinction comes about through an examination of the inertial structure constituted by the entirety of the inertial trajectories. The latter are defined geometrically as a relation on the space-time expressing the situation of relative rest for events.
An axiomatic treatment of Galilean space-time is carried out in the spirit of metrical geometry. According to it only material concepts enter the postulates. The central notion thereby is that of the Galilean inertial relation introduced in a previous paper [1]. In the course of the investigations a bit of theory for strictly convex metric spaces is developed.
It is shown that the linearized Rarita-Schwinger equation on a multi-black-hole background of the Majumdar-Papapetrou class admits time-independent and regular nongauge solutions that die off at infinity. The number of freely available real constants is supposed to be four, thus being independent of the number of black holes. As a consequence, the gravitino field seems to be uniquely determined by its supercharge. Moreover, each supercovariantly constant spinor corresponds to one gravitino solution.
The Lagrangian structure of the geodesic equation allows an extension of classical projective geometry to one-parameter projective group actions on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TM</em> (where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the spacetime). We determine all those projective actions which arise by prolongation of oneparameter group actions on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. The relation between projective actions on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TM</em> and the equation of geodesic deviation is developed.
A new definition of a nakedly singular space-time is proposed. Conformai transformations of general, vacuum space-times are considered for conformai factors which are proper mappings into (0, ∞). A space-time generated in this manner which is null convergent on the future Cauchy development of a partial Cauchy surface is shown to be not nakedly singular relative to that surface in the sense of the chosen definition. If the conformal factor is bounded from above then the untransformed, vacuum space-time is similarly not nakedly singular. A censorship theorem for null convergent, conformally flat space-times is obtained as a corollary to the principal result.
The classical field-dependent parametrization covariant Hamiltonian formulation of the open and the closed string is discussed. The formalism is not applicable to the open string. A conformally covariant formalism is developed for the open string. The Rohrlich gauge conditions are justified and applied. The parametrization of classical solutions is not uniquely fixed; the generators of rigid time translation in the parameter space remain first class. The constraints and gauge conditions are taken into account in the quantum theory as conditions on physical states. The required invariance of physical states under rigid displacement of parameter time leads to a mass superselection rule. The set of physical string quantum states is analogous to the set of states constructed by Di Vecchia, Del Guidice, and Fubini. A recursive construction is presented which permits the counting of physical states of any given mass, spin, and parity. Physical states lie on linearly rising Regge trajectories with one universal slope. The intercept of the leading trajectory is constrained only by the requirement that there be no tachyonic physical states. The quantization is carried out in four space-time dimensions.
A model system, consisting of a thin spherical shell with radius<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> and a point mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> at a distance<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s&gt;R</em> from the center of the sphere, held fixed by an appropriate strut, is solved to order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mM</em>. The stresses in the shell are not of the canonical Weyl type, and it is argued that the same is true for more realistic situations, e.g., rotating matter. Owing to the nonlinearity of Einstein's field equations, the field of the point mass is shielded from the interior of the shell by a factor η lying between 1–3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M/R</em> and 1–2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M/R</em>, and the field outside the shell explicitly depends on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>.
The method, developed in an earlier paper, for tracing geodesies of particles and light rays through Regge calculus space-times, is applied to a number of problems in the Schwarzschild geometry. It is possible to obtain accurate predictions of light bending by taking sufficiently small Regge blocks. Calculations of perihelion precession, Thomas precession, and the distortion of a ball of fluid moving on a geodesic can also show good agreement with the analytic solution. However difficulties arise in obtaining accurate predictions for general orbits in these space-times. Applications to other problems in general relativity are discussed briefly.
This paper deals with the usual methods for the construction of clocks as a first step in the direction of measurements in Weyl space-time. The atomic clocks constructed via atomic transitions, and the gravitational clocks constructed by the method of Marzke and Wheeler measure quantities with Weyl weights zero, whereas the Kundt and Hoffmann method for the construction of a clock was not found to be suitable. The atomic clocks are suitable for the chronometry and as a result of the chronometry it is shown that the Weyl space-time should be integrable.
The predictions of a general unified theory for the gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar field are compared with the results of the experimental tests of the equivalence principle. It is shown that the theoretical predictions do not disagree with experimental data provided that the coupling of the scalar to the electromagnetic field is suppressed by a factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> ∼ 10<sup>−3</sup>, or, alternatively, the scalar field is massive; in this case, a lower limit for its mass is obtained.
A form of the Robinson-Trautman metric for pure radiation is obtained by applying a limiting procedure to the quasispherical gravitational collapse solution of Szekeres. The procedure can be interpreted as that of allowing the particles making up the dust in the Szekeres solution to become massless.
Along with certain properties of a chional isomorphism, it is proved that to convert a chronal isomorphism into a causal isometry, we need only the distinguishingness of one of the space-times.
For a thin shell, the intrinsic 3-pressure will be shown to be analogous to -<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> is the classical surface tension: First, interior and exterior Schwarzschild solutions will be matched together such that the surface layer generated at the common boundary has no gravitational mass; then its intrinsic 3-pressure represents a surface tension fulfilling Kelvin's relation between mean curvature and pressure difference in the Newtonian limit. Second, after a suitable definition of mean curvature, the general relativistic analog to Kelvin's relation will be proven to be contained in the equation of motion of the surface layer.
We examine the geodesic conservation laws associated with the projective actions discussed in our earlier paper with the same overall title. Using the Cartan formalism, a one-to-one correspondence between a class of these actions and all geodesic conservation laws is possible. In particular there is a natural geometric interpretation of Killing tensors. Homothetic motions are shown to correspond to conserved quantities on all geodesies (not just null ones). The same approach identifies homothetic Killing tensors and a universal quadratic first integral which reduces to the conformai Killing tensor case on null geodesics.
The simple soliton solutions of Einstein's equations obtained by Belinski and Zakharov using the inverse scattering method have been interpreted as gravitational (solitary) shock waves, partly on the basis of an analysis of certain (coordinate) singularities apparently inherent to the method. A closer study reveals, however, that such singularities can be removed by an appropriate extension of the solutions, which is given explicitly. A classification of inequivalent flat space-time metrics appropriate for the applications of the method is derived. The problem of matching the Belinski-Zakharov (B-Z) simple solitons to flat space-time is analyzed and found to have more than one solution depending on the type of singularity admitted in the Ricci tensor. This is further illustrated by considering a three-parameter solution, inequivalent to that of Belinski and Zakharov. For negative values of one of these parameters the ranges of the coordinates are limited only by curvature singularities. For positive values of the parameter, coordinate singularities, similar to those in the B-Z solution, are also present. In this case, however, a matching to flat space-time leads to a shock front whose intersection with any spacelike hypersurface is bounded, in contrast with the behavior displayed by the B-Z solutions. The limiting case when the parameter is zero is found to have some special properties. A smooth extension is also shown to exist.
Two classes of regular solutions of five-dimensional general relativity, depending only on two space coordinates, and fulfilling boundary conditions appropriate to gravity theory in two space dimensions, are obtained. The solutions of the first class have a Euclidean spatial topology, while the solutions of the second class have two spatial end points connected by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> wormholes.
The macroscopic stress-energy tensor of an astronomical “medium” such as a galaxy of stars is determined by the field equation of general relativity from the small-scale variations in mass and velocity. In the weak-field, slow-motion approximation, in which the gravitational fields of the stars are Newtonian, it is found that the contribution by the small-scale gravitational fields to the macroscopic density and stress are, respectively, the Newtonian gravitational energy density and the Newtonian gravitational stress tensor. This result is based on the general-relativity field equation, not conservation laws, although the general-relativity field equation has the well-known property of being consistent with conservation laws.
A number of explicit, rotating and expanding cosmological solutions of the Einstein field equations are presented. They have homogeneous hypersurfaces of Bianchi type VIII, and they are locally rotationally symmetric. The source is a perfect fluid with heat flow. The thermodynamic properties of the models are discussed.
We find all torsion-free, spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions to the theory of gravity recently proposed by Hehl, Ne'eman, Nitsch, and von der Heyde. There are three classes of solutions: (A) the Schwarzschild metrics with arbitrary mass,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and arbitrary cosmological constant, Λ; (B) the Nariai-Bertotti metrics with arbitrary positive cosmological constant, Λ; and (C) the conformally flat metrics whose conformai factor is Ω<sup>2</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em><sup>2</sup> where Ω is a function of only the time coordinate τ, and the radial coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>, and satisfies the wave equation in these variables. Hence there is no Birkhoff theorem for this theory. In fact, solutions (C) include some asymptotically flat but nonstationary solutions. On the other hand, solutions (A) include a gravitational confinement potential, as was sought by Hehl et al., since when Λ&lt;0, the weak field limit of the Schwarzschild metric becomes a harmonic oscillator potential. We also discuss the relationship of this theory to the Eddington theory, the Lichnerowicz-Kilmister-Newman-Yang theory, the Nordström theory and the Einstein theory with a cosmological constant.
By integrating the equations for null geodesics we obtain the light-cone cuts of null infinity for the charged Kerr geometries.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for a weakly asymptotically simple and empty, null convergent, generic space-time to be future asymptotically predictable. These conditions require that the causal structure of the space-time is well behaved near spatial infinity and future null infinity, and that there are no singularities of less than a certain finite strength in the future asymptotic limit.
A definition is given which quantifies the strength of persistent Riemann curvature along a null geodesic. A numerical value thereof is identified which ensures the existence of conjugate points on null geodesics of infinite length. A class of examples show that no lesser value can suffice. One is led to a new theorem of cosmic censorship which identifies an upper bound on the persistent curvature strength with which any space-time may violate weak cosmic censorship. All previous theorems are superceded. Moreover an improved logical construction simplifies interpretation.
This paper is a continuation of a previous one, in which the general framework for constructing solitonic perturbations on Bianchi II background was described. Here we calculate the exact solitonic perturbation corresponding to one (real) pole and we investigate in detail some of its main features. Its asymptotic behavior in time is discussed with the aid of a modified oscillatory approach to the singularity.
The Brans-Dicke-Bianchi type-I vacuum solution given in a recent paper by Shri Ram is shown to be identical with the general solution first given by Ruban and Finkelstein.
The asymptotic behavior of a solution of vacuum Einstein equations describing the propagation of a single “soliton wave” on a Bianchi type-II background is investigated numerically. In the framework of the oscillatory approach to a cosmological singularity, the “transitional behavior” corresponding to a critical value of a fundamental integration constant is analyzed.
Relativistic spin<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s (s &gt;/ 1/2)</em>, nonzero mass equations are given which in an arbitrary curved space-time are internally consistent. By means of Riesz' integration method a representation theorem for the solution of Cauchy's problem, using the constraints of the Cauchy data on the initial hypersurface and suitable “Green's formulas,” is proved. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of Huygens' principle is stated from which it follows that only in space-times of constant curvature do the field equations satisfy Huygens' principle.
In the background of Møller's theory, two energy-momentum complexes<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>, are defined. From them, the losses of energy and angular momentum of a nongravitationally bound system due to the radiation of gravitational waves are evaluated. To solve the field equations some approximation procedures are used. The post-Newtonian limit is studied. When the modulus of the coupling constant of the theory is smaller than 10<sup>3</sup> and some reasonable conditions are assumed, the results here obtained appear to be identical to those of general relativity. The work performed here would be basic when dealing with some important questions in generalizing Møller's theory.
The compatibility of Euclidean supergravity with curvature satisfying (a) self-duality and (b) a double duality Ansatz are investigated. The Minkowskian version of (b) is also considered.
In the present work we study models with material and gravitational fields unified in a self-consistent manner [2, 3]. We use a semiclassical approach, where the gravitational field is classical, but the other fields may be quantum ones. The mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking is due to the conformai generalization of the Higgs fields in a curved spacetime. Gravitation will be considered as a gauge field and then in the usual Einstein version.
I demonstrate that dark matter consisting of any type or types of stable weakly interacting elementary particle is incompatible with the minimal predictions of inflation, based on present observation of galaxy clustering, and assuming galaxies are good tracers of mass in the universe. If we wish to resolve this problem by particle physics alone, we seem to be driven to the possibility that the initial dark matter was unstable.



Two solutions are obtained for coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs fields with cylindrical symmetry and rigid rotation. The Higgs fields are responsible for the creation of singularities and infinite energy densities at the cylinder's axis.
This is the first of a series of papers on complex spaces and their use in complex relativity. The basic aim is to develop the theory of complex relativity but only insofar as it helps in obtaining, and understanding, real solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations as slices of complex solutions. In this first paper, specific aims of the whole series are first presented. The basic equations and key entities, which are used later, are presented. The basic relativistic language used is that of Newman and Penrose. Included is a discussion of a number of important properties which arise in the development of the basic equations and key concepts, these properties being mainly ones which are not apparent in standard real formulations.
A holomorphic connection on (1, 0)-vector fields which is intrinsically defined on any curved twistor space is described. Although it is a local operator, it is given in terms of the nonlocal geometry of the twistor space corresponding to the local geometry of the spacetime. The connection is represented in local coordinates by a system of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nonlinear</em> first-order partial differential operators. It has torsion but no curvature. A parallelism is given explicitly, and an example is computed.
We present the full integrability conditions for the Penrose-Floyd equation. Then we proceed to the integration of the Einstein equations under the assumption of the existence of a Penrose-Floyd tensor and we find all space-times admitting such a tensor.

We have found a new class of ideal clocks within general relativity. They are self-gravitating systems such as rotating stars, rotating black holes, and binary star systems. The gravitational red shift of the observed period of rotation of such clocks in a given, weak external gravitational field is shown to be the same as that of an ideal atomic clock. Because the clocks have structure and dynamics determined by gravitational interactions, the full nonlinear machinery of general relativity must be used. This result is important for the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16, where the gravitational red shift of the pulsar's frequency caused by the companion's gravitational field is an observable effect.
The usual construction of an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> space from asymptotic data on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em><sup>+</sup> uses only the radiative component of the asymptotic gravitational field and ignores the longitudinal part of the field [2]. While Penrose and Sparling [1] have given the construction of a deformed twistor space encoding the Schwarzschild structure by exponentiating the linearized spin 2 monopole field, one would like to have a direct<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> space construction as a step toward constructing<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> spaces containing all the asymptotic degrees of freedom. The first step of giving a direct<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> space construction for the Schwarzschild asymptotic data is contained in the following. Several interesting new structures arise in this process.
We consider the maximal subgroups of the conformai group (which have in common as a subgroup the group of pure spatial rotations) as isometry groups of conformally flat spacetimes. We identify the corresponding cosmological solutions of Einstein's field equations. For each of them, we investigate the possibility that it could be generated by an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em> (2) Yang-Mills field built, via the Corrigan-Fairlie-'t Hooft-Wilczek ansatz, from a scalar field identical with the square root of the conformal factor defining the space-time metric tensor. In particular, the Einstein cosmological model can be generated in this manner, but in the framework of strong gravity only, a micro-Einstein universe being then viewed as a possible model for a hadron.

We demonstrate that the equivalence principle is violated by radiative corrections to the gravitational and inertial masses at finite temperature. We argue that this result can be attributed to the Lorentz noninvariance of the finite temperature vacuum.
The effect of quantum fluctuations of gravity on the measurement of proper distances is considered. It is shown that, when the length scales are of the order of Planck length, the concept of a unique distance between points ceases to exist. It is also shown that the quantum expectation value of the proper length is bounded from below by Planck length in any space-time.
It is shown that fairly general assumptions about the relevant physical and mathematical quantities in the study of nonstatic and spherically symmetric perfect fluid configurations usually single out the Friedmann-Lemaître solutions as the only physically plausible ones. In addition three new classes of exact solutions having shear and acceleration are presented, as well as a generalization of Wesson's stiff fluid solution.
It is shown explicitly that a new interior Schwarzschild solution satisfies a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a spherically symmetric metric to join smoothly onto the vacuum field at a nonnull boundary surface. Moreover, the conditions do not prevent the radius of a spherical distribution from assuming values arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild radius.
The evolution of a Schwarzschild black hole in an expanding Friedman universe is described using the same coordinate patch for both geometries. Comoving and extended Kruskal coordinates are considered and compared for the cases<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=1. The conformal structure and some global topological aspects of the Schwarzschild-Friedman system are examined with the help of diagrams in comoving and extended Kruskal coordinates.
Let<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> be a properly immersed timelike hypersurface of Minkowski space and assume that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> has a strictly positive second fundamental form. If each point of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is of diagonal type and dim<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> ⩾ 3, then the Ricci curvature of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is strictly positive on all (nonzero) nonspacelike vectors. Thus<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> satisfies both the generic and strong energy conditions and a singularity theorem for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> may be established.
The solutions of the momentum constraints on the Einstein-Rosen manifold with two bridges, representing two black holes, are analyzed. These solutions are in the form of an infinite series. Their higher order terms are shown to fall off as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−6</sup>. These terms add multipole moments and gravitational radiation to the initial data and do not contribute to the linear and (spin) angular momenta of the black holes.
Calculations are made of the ionization process of hydrogen atom or hydrogenlike ion by gravitons in both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases. Also the process of graviton deuteron fission is examined.
The Robertson-Walker (RW) metrics, of dimensionality four and signature −2, are generalized to metrics of dimensionality (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1) and of arbitrary signature,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> (&gt; 1) being an arbitrary integer. In canonical coordinates (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t, x</em><sup>1</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>2</sup>, ...,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup>) these generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) metrics are functions of the coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>. The following statements are proved to be equivalent: The GRW metrics are (a) expressible in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>-independent form, (b) of constant curvature, (c) Einstein spaces. Furthermore, there are six, and only six, classes of GRW metrics satisfying these three statements. The coordinate transformations which transform these metrics to their<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>-independent form are given explicitly. Two of these classes of GRW metrics reduce, in their<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>-independent form, to the same flat (generalized Minkowski) metrics, three reduce to the same<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>-independent metrics which are generalizations of the de Sitter space-time metric, and the last class to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>-independent metrics which are generalizations of the anti-de Sitter space-time metric.
We study conformal transformations in four-dimensional manifolds. In particular, we present a new set of two necessary and sufficient conditions for a space to be conformal to an Einstein space. The first condition defines the class of spaces conformal to C spaces, whereas the last one (the vanishing of the Bach tensor) gives the particular subclass of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> spaces which are conformally related to Einstein spaces.
We study the wave equation for the Schwarzschild metric. Wave operators are constructed which yield solutions with given asymptotic behavior either at infinity or on the horizon. We prove asymptotic completeness for these wave operators.
We study a stiff fluid Bianchi type-I cosmological model in a scalar-tensor theory proposed by Schmidt et al (1981), where the gravitational constant depends on the strength of the scalar field. Near the singularity the matter density goes to infinity at a faster rate than the amount of shear, which itself becomes infinitely large at this limit. Exact solutions in some special cases are obtained. It is found that at least in these cases there cannot be any lower bound to the spatial volume and the singularity is unavoidable.
It is proved that the stationary semicylindrically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell solutions given in Reference 1 also allow of an interpretation as charge without mass fields. The system of equations is simplified and a previously unknown solution is given.
We study, in the flat space-time limit approximation, the thermodynamical fluctuations of a massive rotating uncharged black hole. Energy and angular momentum correlations as well as other correlations are computed and interpreted.
We consider the initial singularity in the universe as isotropic and with a strength the same as that of the singularity in the density function. We consider the effect of this initial singularity on a particle falling into it in the future at a high speed. This gives a precise understanding of the fate of particles falling into the final singularity in the future of a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>=+1 Friedmann-Le Maitre-Robertson-Walker universe.

We investigate the general behavior of spatially homogeneous cosmological models at large times. Using existing techniques from stability theory we discover that some known exact solutions are asymptotically stable despite possessing special properties. Some consequences of these results are then discussed.
I show that in linearized general relativity it is impossible to construct a detector by the use of which the quantum state of the linearized gravitational field could be reliably determined. This is because there is no material satisfying the positive energy condition which can serve as a good conductor or absorber of gravitational radiation over a finite range of frequencies. If this property is true of the full theory then one can conclude that a certain proportion of both the energy and information carried by a gravitational wave is irreversibly lost, and that there is a corresponding<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic entropy</em> associated with any distribution of gravitational radiation.
We define a “gravitational field strength” in theories of the Einstein-Cartan type admitting a Killing vector. This field strength is a second rank, antisymmetric, divergence-free tensor, whose (“Komar”) integral over a closed 2-surface gives a physically meaningful quantity. We find conditions on the Lagrange density of the theory which ensure the existence of such a tensor, and show that they are satisfied for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2-supergravity and for a special case of the bosonic sector of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=4-supergravity. We discuss a possible application of the generalized Komar integral in the theory of stationary black holes. We also consider the “field strength problem” in Kaluza-Klein theory, where the application to black holes is particularly interesting.
We show that it is possible in principle to build a box which will hold gravitational radiation for a time long enough to thermalize it. The box is a thin spherical shell of charged matter with a large red shift at the surface of the shell. The radiation is kept in the box by the gravitational potential of the shell and is thermalized by the conversion between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We calculate the time for escape of the radiation and show that it is longer than the conversion time.
This paper continues the examination of real metrics and their properties from the viewpoint of complex relativity as initiated by McIntosh and Hickman [1]. Tetrads of real metrics can be formally complexified by complex coordinate transformations and tetrad rotations and their properties investigated from the viewpoint of complex relativity. First, complex bivectors are examined and classified, partly by using the fundamental quadric surface of a metric in projective complex 3-space Pℂ<sup>3</sup>-an elegant but not well-known method of investigating the null structure of a metric. A generalization of the Mariot-Robinson theorem from real relativity is then given and related to various canonical forms of complex bivectors. The second part of the paper discusses four classes of complex metrics. Real metrics of the first class are ones with a null congruence whose wave surfaces have equal curvature. The second class, a subcase of the first one, is the main one; it contains integrable double Kerr-Schild metrics. Different, but equivalent, definitions of such metrics are given from various viewpoints. Two other subcasses are also discussed. The nonexpanding typs-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum metric is considered and it is shown how complex transformations may be made to write it (and subcases) in double (or single) Kerr-Schild form.
For<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> a null vector and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> a vector perpendicular to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, define the null sectional curvature, with respect to TV, of the plane<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> Λ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em><sub>N</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> Λ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>) = 〈<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R(N,A)A,N</em>〉<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∼</em>&lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A∼</em>.Then Robertson-Walker metrics can be locally characterized as those for which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em><sub>n</sub> at each point is a constant for all the null plans at that point (in each null direction,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> must be appropriately chosen). A global characterization of Robertson-Walker spaces is achieved by adding completeness and causality hypotheses.
A number of recent theorems by Królak and Newman purport to prove cosmic censorship by showing that “strong curvature” singularities must be hidden behind horizons. I prove that Newman's “null, strong curvature” condition, which he imposes on certain classes of null geodesics to restrict curvature growth in the space-time, does not hold in many physically realistic space-times: it is not satisfied by any null geodesic in the relevant class in any open Friedmann cosmological model, nor does it hold for any null geodesic in the relevant class in maximal Schwarzschild space. More generally, I argue that the singularity predicted by the Penrose singularity theorem is unlikely to be of the type eliminated by Newman. Thus the Newman theorems are probably without physical significance. The Królak theorems, although based on a physically significant definition of strong curvature singularity, are mathematically invalid, and his approach cannot be used to obtain a cosmic censorship theorem.
It is shown that the nonlocally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type-V vacuum solution recently discussed by Nayak is identical, after trivial transformations, with the solution found some years ago by Joseph. In addition some calculations and remarks concerning the integration of the null geodesic equations are given.
By assuming that we can associate a proper frame to a particle in a field and using relativistic considerations, a generalization of Apsel's prediction that electromagnetic potentials can alter the lifetime of a charged particle is obtained. It is shown, by a new procedure, that these same assumptions lead to the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for the particle. This result seems to disclose a deep connection between kinematical and dynamical aspects of motion.
It is reported on an investigation of cosmologies which constitute explicit, rotating, and expanding solutions of Einstein's field equations, with spacelike, timelike, or null-like homogeneous hypersurfaces of Bianchi type IX, and the source of which is a non-thermalized perfect fluid.
A consistent set of equations of motion for classical charged particles with spin and magnetic dipole moment in a Riemann-Cartan space-time is generated from a constrained Lagrangian formalism. The equations avoid the spurious free helicoidal solutions and at the same time conserve the canonical condition of normalization of the 4-velocity. The 4-velocity and the mechanical moment are parallel in this theory, where the condition of orthogonality between spin and 4-velocity is treated as a nonholonomic constraint. A generalized BMT precession equation is obtained as one of the results of the formalism.
The time-space components of the macroscopic stress-energy tensor of a medium in general relativity (derived in a previous paper) are examined for the momentum density and energy flux of the microscopic gravitational fields. Agreement with both the Newtonian approximation and Chandrasekhar's post-Newtoninan approximation is noted.
A pregeometry of space is considered, in which the only structure imposed on individual points is a uniform probability of adjacency between any two arbitrarily chosen points. This probability is not specified (but only assumed small) and neither is the total number of points specified (but is assumed large). It is shown that the most likely distribution of points has similarities with a closed three-dimensional space of constant positive curvature, in particular, the number of points at a given distance from an arbitrary origin is proportional to sine-squared of the distance from that origin.
Models for a homogeneous, anisotropic, empty, closed universe at a particular moment of time are constructed from sets of empty tetrahedra. It is shown using Regge calculus that only two such models have a moment of time symmetry.
The problem of constructing the Hilbert space of physical states for a free scalar quantum field propagating on a cosmological background is considered. The concept of energy-momentum for such a field is discussed and it is noted that, according to current renormalization theory, for a state ¦M〉 to have finite energy density its associated anticommutator function<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\left\langle {M\left| {\widehat\phi \left( x \right)\widehat\phi \left( {x'} \right) + \widehat\phi \left( {x'} \right)\widehat\phi \left( x \right)} \right|M} \right\rangle \)</span> must be of a particular form first discussed by Hadamard. This restriction is shown to lead to a constraint on the construction of the Hilbert space of physical states. This constraint is used to reject a recently proposed scheme for the construction of this space which was based on a principle of energy minimization.
The so-called scalar-tetradic theories<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> generalize Møller's theory of gravitation. In this work, some results previously obtained in Møller's theory are extended to the theories<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>. When the parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em><sup>*</sup>. of the theory<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> are not too small (or large), the losses of energy and angular momentum of a nongravitationally bound system are proved to be the same as in general relativity. The basic equations of cosmology are derived and some topics are treated. In particular, any density of energy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em><sub>0</sub> (10<sup>−29</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup> ≳<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em><sub>0</sub> ≳ 10<sup>−31</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup>) appears to be compatible with the observational values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>0</sub> (Hubble constant) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>o (deceleration parameter) in the theory A; thus, no intergalactic energy assumption is necessary.
We give an easy way of falsifying the Reichenbach-Grümbaum conventionalist interpretation of the definition of simultaneity of distant events.
The electric and magnetic parts of the linearized Weyl tensor, when the stress-energy tensor is that of a perfect fluid and the background is of Robertson-Walker type, are known to satisfy wave equations that differ by the presence of a source term for the electric part. It is shown here that all of the allowed solutions of the inhomogeneous equation can be obtained by applying a differential operator to the solutions of the homogeneous equation; consequently, electric-type and magnetic-type gravitational waves have the same propagation properties. The results of a complete integration of the appropriately linearized Newman-Penrose equations are given.

The general-relativistic field equations are examined from the point of view of a local inertial observer and a quasilocal definition of energy-momentum is thereby obtained. This definition relates to the Bel-Robinson tensor and the approach is shown to be consistent with the result obtained from the definition of energy given by Hawking.
The most general gauge-invariant Lagrange density (concomitant of the metric tensor together with the gauge potentials of a gauge and its first derivatives) for which the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are precisely Yang-Mills equations is obtained. It is more general than the Lagrangian which is commonly used, but it still has essentially the same energy momentum tensor.
The field equations of general relativity are solved to post-Newtonian order for a rotating frame of reference. A new method of approximation is used based on a 3+1 decomposition of the equations. The results are expressed explicitly in terms of the gravitational potentials. The space-time is asymptotically flat but not locally flat. The space-time metric contains gravitational terms, inertial terms, and coupled gravitational-inertial terms. The inertial terms in the equation of motion are in agreement with terms obtained by other authors using kinematic methods. The metric and equation of motion reduce to those for an inertial frame of reference under a simple coordinate transformation. The total energy of a particle is given. For the restricted three-body problem this represents the relativistic extension of Jacobi's integral to post-Newtonian order.
Solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for static charged dust are discussed. Contrary to what has been asserted earlier it is found that cylindrically symmetric and plane symmetric solutions with the following properties, exist: (a) They are regular in the interior region; (b) the mass density is positive and vanishes at the boundary; (c) the metric, its first derivate, and the electrical field strength are continuous at the boundary; (d) the solutions are mirror symmetric in the plane symmetric case.
The literature on Einstein-Maxwell fields with high symmetry (including some work by the present author) abounds in errors and unwitting rediscoveries. In the present paper certain static axisymmetric, stationary cylindrically symmetric and nonstatic spatially homogeneous space-times which were previously investigated in a series of papers by Raychaudhuri, Datta, Bera, and De [1–11] are considered. In most cases the general solution of the problems tackled is now known, and is repeated here. The earlier papers are analyzed; while errors (some already pointed out by Carminati and McIntosh [12]) and duplications are found, it is believed that the papers discussed contain the first occurrences of three of the solutions. The calculations in this paper have been verified using the computer algebra system SHEEP.
It is shown that the NUT-like dust solution given recently by Lukács et al. (1983) is the dust solution first given by Ellis (1967).
A new analytic relativistic model has been obtained for superdense stars by solving the Einstein field equations for the spherically symmetric and static case. The model stands all the tests of physical reality. The density,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>, remains positive under all conditions and decreases smoothly from the center to the surface of the structure. The pressure,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>, the ratio<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P/ρ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dP/dρ</em> decrease with decreasing density. For all the finite values of pressure, the configurations are stable under radial perturbation. For<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dP/dρ</em>⩽ 1, the maximum mass of neutron star model is 4.17⊙, and the surface and central red shifts are 0.63 and 1.60, respectively. For an infinite central pressure, the surface red shift is 1.61. The structures are bound and the binding coefficients increase with the increasing mass.
The post-Newtonian approximation of the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble or ECSK theory is developed. It is used to obtain a drastic reduction on the density of the source needed to detect the spin. It is also proved that if we know the structure of the source, up to order ¯v, the spin can be detected, and if we know it up to order ¯v<sup>2</sup> the theory can be verified.
Using a theory for the individualization of points of a Riemannian space and introduction or corresponding comoving reference systems for the gravitational field in classical general relativity expressions are obtained for the field energy density as a four-dimensional scalar and a field energy-momentum tensor of rank 2 (not pseudoscalar and pseudotensor, respectively). The results relate to all types of vacuum Riemannian space in agreement with the classifications of A. Z. Petrov and R. Penrose.
Rainer Weiss and collaborators have from first principles derived the response of a free mass interferometer (or 2-arm gravitational wave antenna) to plane polarized gravitational waves [1]. We here obtain equivalent formulas (generalized slightly to allow for arbitrary elliptical polarization) by a simple differencing of the “3-pulse” Doppler response functions of two 1-arm antennas [2]. A “4-pulse” response function is found, with quite complicated angular dependences for arbitrary incident polarization. The differencing method can as readily be used to write exact response functions (“3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1 pulse”!) for antennas having multiple passes, or having more arms.
In the framework of classical field theory, we try to explain why the effective cosmological constant is so small. The basis of the attempt is a Higgs field that shall determine the global structure of the universe. Einstein's theory of gravitation does not allow one to realize the idea. But we are successful if we start from some variant of the scalar-tensor theory of gravitation, choosing for the parameters that enter the Lagrangean of the Higgs field the Compton length of a proton and Eddington's number as self-coupling constant.
A new physical concept about globally regular solutions is suggested. The globally regular solutions corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole and the Reissner-Nordström black hole are examined.
After reviewing problems which appear in the theory of teleparallelism (tetrad theory) based on a Lagrangian quadratic in the torsion, the possibility of adding higher-order terms is discussed. For a “test Lagrangian,”<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3)-symmetric vacuum solutions and spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions are found. The latter contain nonsingular cosmological models.
A simple proof of a generalization of the theorem of Israel concerning the uniqueness of the Reissner-Nordström black holes is presented. The present method is also applied to show, in the bosonic sector of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=4-supergravity, the uniqueness of a static black hole solution found by Gibbons.
From a Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>= (1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>)(-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>)<sup>1/2</sup>[<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>/2+l<sup>2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αR</em><sub>ik</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>ik</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">βR</em><sup>2</sup>)] one obtains fourth-order field equations for the metrical tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ik</sub>. Inserting a 3-flat Robertson-Walker line element, the set of their vacuum solutions will be enumerated completely. The qualitative behavior, and especially the influence of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>-terms (which is possibly necessary for the renormalization of quantum gravity) in certain stages of evolution follow from a phase plane analysis. Depending on the sign of coupling, one obtains either exponentially increasing or oscillating solutions at late times as well as special solutions without an initial singularity.
Using a multipole expansion, we determine formally the massive vector field generated by a point source held fixed in the Schwarzschild space-time. We prove that its limit, when the mass of the Proca field goes to zero, does not tend to the corresponding massless vector field. In this limit we evaluate the expression of the self-force acting on the particle. The result is in accordance with that of Vilenkin, without the assumption that the point source is at a large distance from the horizon, that we extend to the case of a Reissner-Nordström space-time. We also investigate a further case: a point source within a spherical shell of matter for which the Proca field tends to the corresponding massless vector field.
The gravitational perturbation of the excited states of the Klein-Gordon particle moving in a closed box is calculated. The result obtained is used to estimate the magnitude of the gravitational perturbation of energy levels of meson states.


Using the Newman-Penrose formalism and Penrose's conformai rescaling a method is presented for finding systematically solutions of (or, at least, reduced equations for) the general field equations. These solutions are necessarily (locally) asymptotically flat and are represented in a coordinate system based on a geodesic, twist-free, expanding null congruence. All redundant equations are disposed of and the freely specifiable data are clearly exhibited. Although the few equations that remain to be solved are, in general, intractable, well-known theorems guarantee the existence and uniqueness of solutions. The method applies to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℋ</em> spaces and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℋ ℋ</em> spaces as well as to real space-times.
Covariant volume forms are defined in an intrinsic way on a general submanifold of a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>∞</sup> manifold carrying a nondegenerate metric of unspecified signature. The case of covariant volume forms induced on hypersurfaces, null and nonnull, is examined in detail. The results obtained are applied to the various submanifolds of the one-particle phase space of relativistic kinetic theory. Finally a proof of Liouville's theorem is given and its consequences on the Liouville vector are discussed.
We consider solutions of the Einstein field equations for which the Weyl tensor is of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>, and whose source is a perfect fluid with equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=p(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>), where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> are the energy density and pressure of the fluid, respectively. We also impose two additional restrictions which are satisfied by most of the known solutions, namely, that the fluid 4-velocity<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">u</strong> lies in the 2-space spanned by the two repeated principal null directions of the Weyl tensor, and that the Weyl tensor has zero magnetic part relative to<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">u</strong>. Our main result is that for this class of solutions, the equation of state satisfies either<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dp/dw</em>=0 or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dp/dw</em>= 1, or else the solution admits three or more Killing vector fields.
It is shown that there exists a class of nongauge local symmetry in gravity. It is the combination of the known gauge symmetries and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em><sub>off shell</sub> transformation.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em><sub>off shell</sub> is the transformation which vanishes on shell.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em><sub>off shell</sub> invariance imposes some restriction on model Lagrangians besides gauge symmetry, though it does not reduce the physical degrees of freedom.
Astronomical evidence has been inadequately invoked to support projective relativity. The spiral structure cannot be explained just by the existence of spiral orbits, and the use of Oort's constant to support the theory is also a missunderstanding. Besides, some mathematical inaccuracies make the application invalid.
We study the effect of an infinitesimal coordinate transformation on the Lagrangian and on the metric functional of a system of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> point masses. We show how to compute the Lagrangians of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> point masses at the second postNewtonian approximation of general relativity in different coordinate systems. The Lagrangians are shown to depend on the accelerations except in a special class of coordinates. This class includes the coordinates associated with the canonical formalism of Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner, but excludes most other coordinate systems used in the literature (notably the harmonic one).


It is shown that the solution of the field equations for a static spherically symmetric scalar field has a scalar polynomial singularity and no event horizon. The solution does not develop from nonsingular data on any Cauchy surface. The possible existence of a universal scalar field, the conformal diagram and geodesies of the solution, and the energy and momentum of the field present are discussed.
In the year 1958 Møller derived an energy-momentum complex to attain the localizability of the energy in gravitational fields. However, three years later after extensive investigations he himself raised an objection to his expression showing that the corresponding energy-momentum vector of a closed physical system does not transform like a free 4-vector with respect to a Lorentz transformation. An inquiry into the objection of Møller is carried through at full length. Surprisingly it turns out that the equation on which he based his objection originates from a misinterpretation. Moreover, the argument given by him to explain the alleged failure of his expression proves to be incomplete. Complementing the argument, the objection of Møller is no longer tenable.
This paper is the first of a two-article series in which the connections between the gauge group, degeneration, and degrees of freedom in the ECSK theory coupled to an arbitrary tensor field are discussed. In this paper a multisymplectic formulation of the ECSK theory is presented and the symplectic 2-form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>, which plays a leading role in our considerations, is found.
It is shown that in the ECSK theory (coupled to an arbitrary tensor matter field) the degeneration distribution of the symplectic 2-form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> is closely connected with the action of the gauge group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> in the space of solutions to the field equations.
The field equations following from a Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>(1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>)(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>)<sup>1/2</sup>[(1/2)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>(α<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">lk</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">lk</em> </sup>+β<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup>)] will be considered for Bianchi type-I homogeneous models. Thereby the special case,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>+3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em>=0, is considered qualitatively for axially symmetric anisotropic metrics. Generically, the solutions have both past and future singularities, but it will be proven by topological arguments that the two-dimensional space of solutions possesses a one-parameter subspace of solutions with a behavior similar to the Kasner solution.
We present the essential principles of torsion-detection physics and evaluate several conceivable types of experiments and observations for actually detecting torsion fields, reemphasizing also the evident impossibility of successfully searching for its manifestations among cosmological relics. In particular, a polarized body, with net intrinsic (fundamental-particle) spin, is essential for detecting a torsion field. One which possesses only orbital angular momentum—rotation—or an unpolarized intrinsic spin density will not feel torsion. The fundamental problem in searching for such fields is the extremely small basic unit of the coupling or interaction energy between the torsion field and spin,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ɛ≈(8πG′/c</em><sup>2</sup>)(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℏ</em><sup>2</sup>/4). The best way of maximizing the total interaction energy is to increase the spin density of the source<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em><sub>s</sub>, and, at the same time the “spin number”<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>D</sub> of the detector.
We explain the general fact that Friedmann models in Kaluza-Klein cosmologies, in which ordinary space-time is supplemented by internal factor spaces, are equivalent to the motion of tensorial-mass particle in a scalar field. We find exact solutions for an important class of three-component matter in the case of one internal space of dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. The three components in question are the curvature of the internal space, the Zeldovich matter, and dust of the protoradiation type. The method includes one-component solutions for all the different models of compactification discussed so far.
We present the general solution to Einstein-Maxwell equations representing plane-symmetric metrics associated with electromagnetic fields that are not fully plane-symmetric. There are two classes in the general solution, the first approaches Taub's static metric or Kasner's spatially homogeneous one as the electromagnetic field goes to zero, while the second approaches the fiat metric.

When Lagrangians are restricted to subspaces of the phase space satisfying certain symmetry conditions, they do not always yield the correct Einstein equations. An example was found by Hawking in the Lagrangian for spatially homogeneous universes. First we show that this problem is not limited to general relativity. Then we “visualize” certain terms which do not appear in Lagrangians on symmetry-restricted phase spaces but which nevertheless contribute to the Euler-Lagrange derivatives. We apply our general formula to the Schwarzschild metric, the Friedmann universes, and spatially homogeneous universes.
A procedure is proposed for construction of the gravitational multipoles. The full metric is given in the case of a mass possessing a quadrupole moment.
Equilibrium configurations of self-gravitating massless thermal radiation inside spherical boxes of radius<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> = -3/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sub>2</sub>) are constructed numerically for a range of central densities. For each box radius considered (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R/b</em> = 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ∞), there is a unique configuration with maximal total mass and entropy, and another (at a lower central density) with maximum asymptotic red-shifted temperature. With the box removed to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>=∞, the maximum total mass and entropy of self-gravitating thermal radiation are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>max</sub>≈ 0.4598b≈0.7964(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>)<sup>−1/2</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>max</sub>≈1.3560<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em><sup>1/4</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sup>3/2</sup>≈ 3.
We discuss the prospect of detecting a gravitational wave background by means of a simultaneous Doppler tracking of two spacecraft. We find that the cross spectrum of the Doppler shifts of the two spacecraft is a filtered expression of the energy density spectrum of the background. The filter function, which is expressed as a series in terms of Legendre polynomials, is obtained by an integration over the rotation group, assuming the background to be isotropic. We examine the main noise sources and point out the advantages of a measurement with two spacecraft.
A method is presented for evaluating post-Newtonian orbital corrections to the orbital-period decrease of a relativistic binary, by using previous results on the gravitational-radiation luminosity of a bounded source and the binary's relative motion. The method is based on an energy-balance equation, whose validity to post-Newtonian accuracy is not proved here, but, in view of recent theoretical results on the classical energy-balance equation, seems to be quite reasonable, and, in view of the available observational data, is practically correct. In the case of the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 the proposed relative orbital correction amounts to ∼10<sup>−6</sup> of the current observational uncertainty, thus greatly favoring the predictions of the classical quadrupole formula.
The general solution of Einstein's equations governing the behavior of a nonclosed spherical gravitational source exchanging the mass-energy with its environment is investigated and an exterior solution concerning the emission and accretion in some special cases is found. Also the transfer of mass-energy inside the horizon is briefly discussed.
We use the exterior calculus and some decomposition techniques within this formalism in order to make the in general very complicated structure of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub>-field equations of gravity more transparent. As a result, some of the equations take on a rather simple form, which can even be given in several equivalent versions according to various requirements. Furthermore, we study models in diverse dimensions and give classes of solutions under certain assumptions.
We discuss a set of static metrics with cylindrical symmetry describing the interior and exterior space-time of a model of cosmic strings considered recently in cosmology. The interior metric depends on one arbitrary function and the exterior on one constant. We find the relation between this constant and the linear mass density of the cosmic string. A cosmic string can be also treated as a line source in the framework of the distribution-valued curvature formalism which allows us to obtain again the same relation.
The periodicity in the distribution of quasar red shifts is interpreted assuming that the cosmological space is a topologically compactified manifold like the three-dimensional torus. The present size of such compact space is estimated as the order of 600 Mpc.
Some new exact models for an expanding or a contracting “gaseous” sphere (i.e., the density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϱ</em> is to vanish at the outer boundary together with the pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>) are given. The physical properties of the models are investigated, and it is found that both the pressure and the density are positive inside the outer boundary of the sphere, and their respective gradients are negative. The density is increasing for contracting spheres, and it is decreasing for expanding spheres. It is also shown that this is the case for the pressure at any moment for the layers close to the boundary of the spheres. For these layers it is further shown that the adiabatic speed of sound is less than the speed of light, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is positive. The rate of change of the circumference as measured by an observer riding on the boundary of the sphere is increasing for expanding spheres and it is decreasing for collapsing spheres. We also find that the “physical radius” is an increasing function of comoving radial coordinate. The mass function is further shown to be positive.
Within the framework of the Poincaré gauge field theory of gravity, the general gravitational Lagrangian coupled to the electromagnetic field is investigated. We treat the case of a static, spherically symmetric field with space reflection invariance. The exact solutions presented will be generated by a double-duality ansatz for the curvature. The Reissner-Nordström metric is singled out within a class of Lagrangians admitting an asymptotically flat metric.
The generalization of the ordinary hypothesis of Riemannian geodesics for test bodies motion to the hypothesis of Finslerian geodesies gives rise to observable consequences which can explicitly be described in the case of the static gravitational field. The Finslerian corrections prove to be those in the velocity of motion and lead, in particular, to centennial changes in the eccentricities of the planetary orbits. The residual change in the eccentricity of the Mercurian orbit unexplainable by the Riemannian post-Newtonian corrections is used to estimate the order of a characteristic Finslerian parameter.
The main result in this note states and proves that the space topology for Lorentz manifolds is 0-semimetrizable. This is in a certain sense the “spacelike” version of an analogous result for the Hawking-King-McCarthy path topology, which was published in [5]. But the proofs are completely different. The space topology is the finest topology on a Lorentz manifold, which induces the manifold topology on every spacelike hypersurface. Its geometric significance comes from the fact, that its full homeomorphismgroup is the group of all conformal diffeomorphisms. 0-semimetrics are very natural generalizations of metrics and have interesting interpretations as “statistical metrics” and as “metrics with an elementary length.
A self-consistent<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1)-gauge model in gravitational field is investigated. The exact solutions of two types of corresponding field equations are obtained. These solutions can be interpreted as magnetic monopoles. The first solution is regular for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> ≠ 0 and provides an everywhere regular geometry, the second one has a physical singularity. In order to guarantee the stability of the monopoles we introduce the notion of a gravitational topological charge using de Rham's cohomology theory. This topological charge describes the sizes and the inner structure of the monopole.
We present a complete analysis of the higher-dimensional Brans-Dicke cosmologies in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d+D</em> dimensions. The solutions given are perfect fluid generalizations of the vacuum solutions due to Chodos-Detweiler and Freund.
An argument supporting the Bekenstein interpretation of black hole entropy is presented.
A distribution of virtual black holes in the vacuum will induce modifications in the density of states for small perturbations of gravitational and matter fields. If the virtual black holes fill the volume of a typical spacelike surface then perturbation theory becomes more convergent and may even be finite, depending on how fast the number of virtual black holes increases as their size decreases. For distributions of virtual black holes which are scale invariant the effective dimension of space-time is lowered to a noninteger value less than 4, leading to an interpretation in terms of fractal geometry. In this case general relativity is renormalizable in the 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> expansion without higher derivative terms. As the Hamiltonian is not modified the theory is stable.
The quantum state of the universe is described by Hartle and Hawking's ground state which is defined by a path integral over all compact metrics. The most probable classical evolution of the universe can be considered to come from some gravitational instanton by a quantum tunneling. These arguments have been generalized to the case of Kaluza-Klein models. It is found that in d= 11 simple supergravity, with a minisuperspace ansatz, all instantons must have a four dimensional sector. It suggests that this is the main reason why space-time is four-dimensional.
The bundle structures required by volume-preserving and related projective properties are developed and discussed in the context of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>(4) gauge theories which may be taken as the proper framework for Poincaré gauge theories. The results of this paper include methods for extending both tensors and connections to a principal fiber bundle having<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>1(4,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)x<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>1(4,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) as its structure group. This bundle structure is shown to be a natural arena for the generalized (±) covariant differentiation utilized by Einstein for his extended gravitational theories involving nonsymmetric connections. In particular, it is shown that this generalized (±) covariant differentiation is actually a special case of ordinary covariant differentiation with respect to a connection on the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>1(4,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) x<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>1(4,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) bundle. These results are discussed in relation to certain properties of generalized gravitational theories based on a nonsymmetric connection which include the metric affine theories of Hehl et al. and the general requirement that it should be possible to formulate well-defined local conservation laws. In terms of the extended bundle structure considered in this paper, it is found that physically distinct particle number type conservation expressions could exist for certain given types of matter currents.
In a microscopical theory of gravity the coupling of internal gauge degrees of freedom to those of space-time are studied. A magnetic-monopole-type solution for the coupled<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) Yang-Mills-Higgs system in a space-time with curvature and torsion is derived. The coupling constant of the Lorentz gauge bosons can be related directly to the (constant) Higgs field and to the “cosmological constant” which is induced by the quadratic curvature terms in the Lagrangian. This reveals a new interpretation of the parameters entering the general Lagrangian density of the Poincaré gauge field theory (PG).
Two accretion modes (disclike and Bondi type), based on a discontinuous change in location of the sound horizon, exist generally for accretion onto a Kerr black hole, except for the case of a corotating accretion flow onto a very rapidly rotating hole, in which only Bondi-type mode is possible.

Ten-dimensional superstring theories have been proposed as candidates for a unified description of all the forces of nature. These theories reduce to Einstein gravity coupled to Yang-Mills interactions at energy scales small compared to the string tension. The phenomenologically promising superstring theory, the heterotic string, is investigated at the high temperatures and short distances relevant in the early universe. The massive string modes alone constitute an unstable thermodynamic system with negative specific heat. The conditions for equilibrium between the massive string modes and the massless modes (radiation) are derived. The large energy fluctuations of the system require the use of the microcanonical ensemble. There is a maximum temperature which exceeds the temperature at which the canonical partition function becomes divergent. Above a critical volume there is a phase transition during which the massive string modes must evaporate. The possibilities of spontaneous compactification, large entropy production, and a solution of the horizon and flatness problems are discussed.
We review the theoretical arguments and experimental evidence (both direct and indirect) for the conventional view that the gravitational acceleration of antimatter must be the same as that of matter. We find there is no compelling support for such a belief. Therefore, we propose to measure the gravitational acceleration of antiprotons using a beam extracted from the low-energy antiproton ring (LEAR) at CERN.
We study a class of four-dimensional real Lorentzian manifolds generated by a global operator (satisfying a cubic equation). We characterize empty, Einstein, conformally flat spaces and construct mathematical models of two physical space-times. Locally, the solutions presented have been identified with known solutions. Kruskal space-time is generated by using the warped product technique [11].
A study of the nontilted diagonal Bianchi type-V perfect fluid models is undertaken in the nonlocally rotationally symmetric case. It is shown that in such a model, the singularity is necessarily velocity dominated and the upper bound for the ratio of the shear to the expansion is 1/√3. A class of such exact models is also presented; the structure of the singularity and the effect of the anisotropy on the scale are discussed. Lastly, an attempt is made to solve exactly the equations of motion for the coordinates of the null geodesics.
The interior solutions of (the tetrad versions of) Einstein's field equations with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em> </sub> having Segré characteristic [111, 1] (which has all four eigenvalues distinct), are investigated. For this purpose a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mixed method</em>, which combines Synge's<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> method and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> method, is introduced. Some of the tetrad equations are solved for the metric functions while the remaining equations are used to define the corresponding components of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em> </sub>. As necessary conditions of the consistency of the mixed method the conservation equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em> </sup>∥<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> </sub>=0 are explicitly verified. Several simplifications and analysis of some differential inequalities show the existence of a new class of solutions which, in addition to having Segré characteristic [111, 1], also satisfy the strong energy conditions of Hawking and Ellis.

Einstein's vacuum field equations are integrated in complex relativity in a major subcase of the class whose Weyl tensor is of the type N⊗N, i.e., when the left and right Weyl spinors Ψ and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\tilde \Psi \)</span> are each of type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N.</em> The subcase is the complex equivalent of the real nontwisting case. Five separate families of solutions are found. Three of these are complexified versions of the two families of plane-fronted waves and the Robinson-Trautman real type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> metrics and two are complex solutions which do not have any real slices of Lorentz signature. Before the equations are integrated, the relevant general theory and equations are developed in a tetrad frame which is well suited to the discussion of these and a wider class of complex solutions and is called a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">left quarter flat</em> frame. The relationship between this frame and the coordinates used and some other frames and coordinates, including the complexified version of the frame often used for real type-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> metrics, is discussed.
Asymptotically Minkowskian stationary axisymmetric solutions of the five-dimensional Einstein equations are generated from particular classes of stationary axisymmetric solutions of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations. First, the five-dimensional electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions are generated from the four-dimensional electrostatic solutions and a harmonic scalar field. Then, a new class of five-dimensional nonstatic solutions are generated from the four-dimensional class ℰ=+1. As an example, a three-parameter family of regular asymptotically flat rotating solutions is constructed. These solutions can be interpreted, after dimensional reduction to four dimensions, as extended elementary particles with mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic dipole moment.
We study the dynamical evolution of a seven-dimensional, homogeneous, cosmological model. Anisotropy is prevailed all over the spatial dimensions with the topology S<sup>3</sup> × S<sup>3</sup>, and leads to repetitious (nonchaotic) oscillations of the scale factors. The universe evolves from an initial Kasner phase to a final one, from which the dimensional reduction results. We pay attention to the effect of radiation-energy density and discuss the isotropization of ordinary dimensions through the stabilization of extra dimensions at the Kaluza-Klein radius.
A number of solutions for material shell sources of stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields are presented. Explicit solutions are found for shells lying on equipotential hypersurfaces (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tt</em> </sub> = const) and generating static “monopole” fields in prolate and oblate spheroidal coordinates (Zipoy-Voorhees fields). Numerical solutions are found for shells lying on hypersurfaces of constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em> </sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕϕ</em> </sub> and generating Kerr- and Tomimatsu-Sato (δ = 2) fields. The shells have minimum areas allowed by the energy conditions of Hawking and Ellis.
As the red shift shows no sign of oscillatory behavior in an expanding universe we postulate that the energy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub> of a scalar field does not oscillate in such a universe. In the massive case, expanding the differential equation for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub> in mass powers, we find that the nonoscillatory solution coincides with the adiabatic solution up to the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>6</sup> order. We also demonstrate that this solution is unique for all the evolution of the universe with cosmological interest. Using the nonoscillatory solution as the one that defines the good vacuum state, we compute the particle and energy creation for a simple model of expanding universe. Both quantities turn out to be finite.
Rational first integrals of the equation determining the geodesies of a given Riemannian space are investigated. It is shown that integrability conditions can be obtained for the existence of such integrals, the conditions being analogous to those associated with linear first integrals but, unfortunately, of a vastly more complicated form.

The assumptions that enter into the formulation of the gravitational wave problem in the limit of high frequency are discussed. It is shown that depending on the relation between the amplitude parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> and the frequency parameter ε the concept of “back-reaction” can have different physical interpretations. We also show that as a direct consequence of these assumptions high-frequency gravitational waves do not disperse in a vacuum. Finally, we make some conjectures about a coordinate-free characterization of high frequency for some cases and also about the use of the invariants of the Weyl tensor for the problem of finding a background space-time given a vacuum space-time containing high-frequency gravitational radiation.
The leading radiation reaction in quasistatic, axially symmetric systems is calculated by matched asymptotic expansions. Earlier results on inductive transfer of near-zone “energy” are combined via matching with a wave-zone expansion in the Regge-Wheeler gauge. Two independent measures of the damping are computed: (1) the change of the 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>coefficient in a Weyl-Levi-Cività type of multipole expansion in the near zone and (2) the change in Bondi energy at future null infinity. When an averaging process is justified, such as in (nearly) periodic systems, both quantities yield a generalized version of the usual quadrupole formula, provided the radiation is outgoing at future null infinity. It is also shown that terms nonanalytic in the slow-motion parameter ɛ make a time-even contribution to the near-zone monopole coefficient. The principal advantage of this calculation over previous work is that the sources are permitted to have strong gravitational fields. Moreover, no specific model for the sources is assumed.
The ADM Hamiltonian for a many-particle system is calculated up to the postlinear approximation, i.e., to the approximation that both the equations of motion for the particles and the equations of motion for the gravitational field in case of no-incoming radiation correctly result up to the postlinear approximation. The relation of this Hamiltonian to the ADM Hamiltonian obtained by a post-Newtonian approximation scheme which was applied up to the first radiation-reaction and radiation levels is discussed. From here the standard formulas for the mechanical angular momentum and energy losses as well as the radiated energy and angular momentum are deduced. Background logarithmic and logarithmic radiative terms are shown to be not present at our approximation if the condition of no-incoming radiation is fulfilled.
Specializing Penrose and Floyd's result<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab;c</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[ab;c]</em> </sub> to the Kerr metric, we explicitly construct the skew symmetric tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> and Carter's quadratic integral of geodesic motion.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> is then shown to be closely related to the orbital angular momentum encountered in Newtonian mechanics. Furthermore, F<sub>ab</sub> can be decomposed additively into<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> has the character of angular momentum, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> exists only for a nonzero rotation parameter,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, of the Kerr metric. It turns out that the equation of precession<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\dot L_a\)</span>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sub> has a nontrivial solution only for the case of a slowly rotating Kerr metric valid to first order in rotation parameter. In this case, Carter's integral can be interpreted as the squared length of the precessing angular momentum vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sub>. The equation of precession is solved, and a vector Ω<sup>a</sup> describing angular velocity of precession is derived.
The ultralocal representation of the canonically quantized gravitational field is used to obtain the evolution of coherent states in the immediate neighborhood of the singularity. It is shown that smearing functions play the role of classical fields since they correspond to cosmological solutions around the singularity. A special class of ultralocal coherent states is shown to contain the essential aspects of the dynamics of the system when we choose a simple representation for the field operators of the theory. When the ultralocality condition is broken a conjecture will be made about the quantum evolution of coherent states in the classical limit.
Along with certain properties of the region where distinguishingness is violated, it is proved that the violation of distinguishingness and reflectingness cannot occur individually.
We give a simple characterization of locally rotationally symmetric space-times in terms of the existence of a canonical null tetrad or canonical orthonormal tetrad. The result is applied to space-times which satisfy the Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid or electromagnetic field as source.
The theory of direct interparticle gravitational interaction is constructed, based on an action principle of the Fokker type, including many-particle interactions. The action is defined in a background space-time implying the requirement of a possibility to represent the equations of motion of a test particle in the form of geodesic equations in an effective Riemannian metric in any order of the gravitational constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. It is pointed out that this metric satisfies identically the Einstein equations on each step of the iteration procedure. The background metric must satisfy the condition<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathop R\limits^ \circ _{\alpha \beta } = 0\)</span>. In the first approximation the absorber theory of gravitational radiation is proved.
The Newman-Penrose nonlinear asymptotic field equations are separated in terms of spin weight spherical harmonics (s.w.s.h.). As an example, the results are used to study the radiation effects on a two-body system. The presence of radiation is manifest through the nonlinear terms in the asymptotic equations. If these terms are assumed to be small, the asymptotic equations can be formally solved by an iteration procedure. For the above example the first step of the iteration procedure is implemented to an accuracy that includes the effects of radiation up to octopole order. The results illustrate the usual internal decay of the orbit as well as an acceleration of the system's center of mass. In favorable cases, the two-body source can reach significant velocities due to the radiation reaction.
By placing a force field in the vertical arms of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner interferometer, an additional phase shift, of order the mean potential for this force over<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mc</em> <sup>2</sup> times the COW phase shift, can be obtained, which comes about because of the different velocity dependences of the gravitational and the extra forces.
We develop a general unified theory of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism in a gravitational field on Friedman-Schöuten space-time (FSS). In this formalism (i) local equations of a charged fluid in an electromagnetic field are the same as in classical mechanics, (ii) local equations for a moving charged fluid are the same as in electromagnetism, (iii) the path of a charged particle under gravity and electromagnetism is a geodesic of the four-dimensional FSS, and (iv) the strong equivalence principle and a nonzero torsion coexist without conflict.
A class of algebraically special non-null electrovac solutions is presented, in which the repeated principal null congruence is shear free, twist free, and geodesic, and is not aligned with a principal null direction of the electromagnetic field. This class includes all previously known solutions of this type as special cases. It can also be considered as a generalization of the Robinson-Trautman family of solutions.
A new generation technique is elaborated in the case of static spherically symmetric distribution of charged fluid. The above technique deals only with a charged perfect fluid verifying a barytropic equation of state, i.e.,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P=(γ−1)ρ</em>. Many new exact solutions have then been generated from those of Pant and Sah, Banerjee and Santos, Humi and Mansour. Their physical properties are then studied in some detail.


This paper shows that general relativity and ordinary continuum models of matter imply the presence of Cartan torsion. The key concept is that torsion can be viewed as translational holonomy per unit area, in the limit of very small areas. Translational holonomy is introduced as the nonclosure of the “development” of a space-time loop into a flat space-time. The translational holonomy around a charged rotating black hole is calculated. If a large collection of small rotating objects is approximated by continuous spinning matter, the resulting torsion and spin have the same relation as in Einstein-Cartan theory, except that the torsion traces remain zero for the simple model of spinning matter used here. Finally, this construction adds torsion to the list of nonpropagating fields which can be viewed as continuum density of holonomy around localized space-time boundaries, or around throats which are connected to further local topological structures.
A spatially homogeneous and locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type-II cosmological model under the influence of both shear and bulk viscosity has been studied. Exact solutions are obtained with a barotropic equation of state (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=ɛρ</em>) and considering the linear relationships between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>, θ<sup>2</sup>, and σ<sup>2</sup>, which represent the fluid density, the expansion, and the shear scalars, respectively. Special cases with vanishing bulk viscosity coefficients and with the perfect fluid in the absence of viscosity have also been studied. The formal appearance of the solutions is the same for both the viscous as well as the perfect fluids. The difference is only in choosing a constant parameter which appears in the solutions. In the cases of either a fluid with bulk viscosity alone or a perfect fluid, the barotropic equation of state is no longer an additional assumption to be imposed; rather it follows directly from the field equations.
The scalar-tetradic Theory<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> has been recently formulated. In this paper it is proved that, for a suitable tetrad field and any given value of the coupling constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> of the theory, there is a unique static spherically symmetric solution of the field equations describing the outer field of a standard perfect fluid sphere (such as the sun); the explicit form of this solution in terms of the radial isotropic coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> appears to be different in the three cases: (1)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> &lt;0 or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> &gt; 2, (2) 0 &lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> &lt; 2, and (3)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> =2. On account of the Birkhoff theorem the quoted solution appears to have considerable physical interest.
The equilibrium conditions for the superposition of two Kerr-NUT solutions are revisited. The new derivation of these conditions leads to formulas which include also the hyperextreme case. In the symmetric model of two hyperextreme constituents [3–5,8] the surface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>=0 of infinite red shift is investigated. It turns out that, for large enough distance parameter, the surface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>=0 consists of disconnected parts surrounding each source separately.
The conjecture is proved that stationary vacuum space-times having a conformally flat three-space are axially symmetric. The proof uses the Ernst potential and the complex conjugate potential as independent coordinates. Two field equations: a combination of the Einstein equations and an integrability condition are algebraic in one of the field variables. Their coefficients, computed by employing a REDUCE program, separately vanish unless axial symmetry holds. Solution of the coefficient equations yields the proof of axial symmetry. Certain special classes of metrics must be excluded from the discussion. The axial symmetry of these exceptional classes has been proved in I.
It is shown that stationary vacuum space-times having a conformally flat 3-space are always characterized by a functional relationship between the real and imaginary parts of the Ernst potential. This result is based on a new formulation of Einstein's equation, and it completes the investigation of vacuum space-times with conformally flat spaces.
We show that the logical treatment of spinning perfect fluids occurs in a metrictorsion space-time with or without mass conservation. The consequence is the geometrization of spin; that is, we obtain the Weyssenhoff form relating spin and the trace-free torsion without any ad hoc assumption.

Some new properties of geodesies and other curves lying in the spatial sections<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = const. of the Curzon solution are derived. These are shown to allow one to build up a new coordinate system in which the singularity appears unambiguously as a ring. A new region of spacelike infinity is also revealed on the “other side” of this ring, which can be approached by spatial geodesies threading through the ring.
A new coordinate system is presented for the Curzon metric such that a class of incomplete geodesics are extendible both in the past and the future into regions of flat space. All other incomplete geodesics terminate at the (infinite curvature) singularity, which appears as a ring with finite radius and is naked. The Curzon solution emerges in this picture as a peculiar kind of sandwich wave. This and other physical interpretations such as a possible collapse scenario are discussed.
It is shown that only de Sitter space and Minkowski space can be expressed in more than one of the standard forms for Robertson-Walker space-times.
The new class of interior Schwarzschild solutions found by Florides is generalized to the charged case. A particular solution within this class is found, which represents an electromagnetic mass-model of a neutral spherically symmetric system. The pressure is isotropic, decreasing monotonously with increasing radius and vanishes at the surface of the matter distribution. The solution is regular everywhere inside a radius<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, and is joined continuously to the exterior Schwarzschild solution at this radius.
A<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">grand superspace</em> is proposed as the phase space for gauge field theories with a fixed structure group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> over a fixed space-time manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. This superspace incorporates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> principal fiber bundles with these data. This phase space is the space of isomorphism classes of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> connections on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all G</em>-principal fiber bundles over<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> (fixed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>). The justification for choosing this grand superspace for the phase space is that the space-time and the structure group are determinants of the physical theory, but the principal fiber bundle with the given<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is not. Grand superspace is studied in terms of a natural universal principal fiber bundle over<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, canonically associated with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> alone, and with a natural universal connection on this bundle. This bundle and its connection are universal in the sense that all connections on all<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>-principal fiber bundles (any<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>) over<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> can be recovered from this universal bundle and its universal connection by a canonical construction. When<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is Abelian, grand superspace is shown to be an Abelian group. Various subspaces of grand superspace consisting of the isomorphism classes of flat connections and of Yang-Mills connections are also discussed.
Alvarez-Gaumé and Witten have shown that energy-momentum conservation must be violated in certain parity-violating quantum field theories involving gravity. In two dimensions this effect can be studied without the aid of Feynman diagrams or calculations in momentum space. The arguments parallel those for the conformal (trace) anomaly; as in that case, there are two kinds of arguments, one based on the conservation equations themselves with some very general assumptions, and the other based on explicit calculations and renormalization in a model theory with a linear field equation. The basic point is that if matter is created at all by the gravitational field, it must appear in both left-moving and right-moving modes if the conservation law is to hold always.
Einstein theory in three space-time dimensions is studied in the stationary, rotationally symmetric regime. Explicit interior solutions for various types of matter sources are found and their properties discussed.
We study the analytic behavior of a class, the so-called infrared sector, of globally regular vacuum Maxwell fields in the neighborhood of the boundary of compactified Minkowski space, i.e., in the neighborhood of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em><sup>±</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em><sup>0</sup>, and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(S^ \pm \)</span>. It is shown that generally they are regular everywhere except at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em><sup>0</sup>.
The nonstatic analogues of the Kohler-Chao perfect fluid solution have been derived starting with a spherically symmetric flat<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sub>5</sub>. It is also established that all the Petrov type D perfect fluid solutions of imbedding class one do not possess a pressure-free surface at a finite radius and therefore cannot be fitted to the external Schwarzschild's model.
When a space-time, containing an irrotational perfect fluid with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w + p ≠</em> 0, is conformally Ricci-flat, three possibilities arise: (a) When the gradient of the conformal scalar field is aligned with the fluid velocity, the solution is conformally flat; (b) when the gradient is orthogonal to the fluid velocity, solutions are either shearfree, nonexpanding and (pseudo-) spherically or plane-symmetric, or they are conformally related to a particular new vacuum solution admitting a three-dimensional group of motions of Bianchi type VI<sub>o</sub> on a timelike hypersurface; (c) in the general case solutions are (pseudo) spherically or plane-symmetric and have nonvanishing expansion.
Starting from the generally covariant version of the Pauli-Fierz mass term, it is stressed that the tensor fields representing spin-2 particles, eigenstates of strong and gravitational interactions, are linear combinations of one massive and one massless state. This implies that any hadronic reaction, in which massive tensor particles are produced, can be regarded, at least in principle, also as an effective source of gravitons which may become very important in the early stages of the universe; conversely, any process in which gravitational radiation of sufficiently high energy is emitted, should be a source of strongly interacting tensor particles which decay into photons and neutrinos. These two effects could be used for producing and detecting gravitational waves.
All the Freund-Rubin type solutions of the 11-dimensional supergravity with a simply connected quotient space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/H</em> as the compact 7-dimensional manifold are found. Their geometries depend only on the imbedding of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H⊂G</em> and the Riemannian structure of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/H.</em> In particular, SU<sub>3</sub>×SU<sub>2</sub>×U<sub>1</sub>/SU<sub>2</sub>×U<sub>1</sub>×U<sub>1</sub>, Einstein solutions are discussed in detail.
We consider vector-tensor minimally coupled Lagrangians, i.e., scalar densities of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ = g</em><sup>1/2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ψ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ψ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i,j</em> </sub>). We prove that the gauge invariance of any of the sets of Euler-Lagrange expressions implies the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian itself for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> even, and an “almost” gauge invariance for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> odd. We also find those ℒ for which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em>) = 0 or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>) = 0, generalizing well-known results by Lovelock and a result by the authors.
Starting with the hypothesis that space-time is locally embedded in a (4+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>)-dimensiorial flat space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4+n</sub>, a geometric Kaluza-Klein theory is derived with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(10) gauge symmetry and an additional spin-2 field represented by the second fundamental form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>. This quadratic form imposes a natural boundary on the complementary subspace orthogonal to the space-time, regarded as the internal space. The Gauss-Coddazi-Ricci equations are combined to produce low-energy field equations where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> enters as a source field. High-energy dynamics are described by a continuum of space-time perturbations in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4+ n</sub> induced by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>, satisfying Einstein-Yang-Mills equations. The space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4+n</sub> is regarded as a particular space representing the ground state of a more general theory yet to be constructed.
A simple approach for finding the exact solution of the matter dust distribution in the Brans-Dicke cosmology has been attempted. The condition for obtaining a complete exact solution is presented.
A new class of static spin-3/2 excitations on the Majumdar-Papapetrou backgrounds of multi-black hole space-times is exhibited. The Rarita-Schwinger field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ψ</em> shows line singularities which give rise to magnetic-type charges. Analogies to the Dirac-monopole solutions are discussed.
Gravitational waves and lenses were among the earliest predictions of general relativity. I demonstrate here how both these phenomena can, in conjunction with newly discovered astrophysical objects, be used to test fundamental aspects of early universe cosmology, including (a) scenarios for galaxy formation, and (b) nonadiabatic expansion before and after nucleosynthesis.
Using a multipolar expansion we determine the electrostatic potential generated by a point source held fixed in the Schwarzschild metric matched successively with two interior metrics, which describes, respectively, two forms of material distributions. The expression of the potential obtained is reformulated by means of the Copson-Linet potential, valid for the Schwarzschild black hole situation. The self-force acting on the source is then determined. We establish that its expression depends on the material sources of the gravitational field. The transition to the black hole situation is then performed.
The asymptotic behavior of a solution of vacuum Einstein equations describing the propagation of a double “soliton wave” on a Bianchi type-II background is investigated numerically.
Using nonscattering potentials of Chang and Janis, a large class of spherically symmetric space-times is constructed on which all multipole solutions to the minimally coupled scalar wave equation are expressible in terms of characteristic data functions in essentially as simple a fashion as for flat space-time. The space-times are transparent to multipole waves in the same sense that flat space-time is. Both conformally flat and not conformally flat space-times are obtained. Some examples are discussed which show that the variety of transparent space-times is large even within the class of Robertson-Walker spaces.
We show that there exists a close relationship between inner geometry of a null hypersurface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub> and the Newman-Penrose (NP) spin coefficient formalism. Projecting the null complex<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">NP</strong> tetrad onto<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub> we get two triads of basis vectors in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub>. Inner geometry of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub> is based on the assumption that these vectors are parallelly transported along the surface; this gives rise to the teleparallel connection as a metric nonsymmetric affine connection. The gauge freedom for the choice of the basis triads is given by the isotropy subgroup of the local Lorentz group leaving invariant the direction of the null generators of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub>, and teleparallelism is determined by the equivalence class of the basis triads with respect to the global gauge group. Nine of the twelve NP coefficients are identified as the triad components of the torsion and the second fundamental form of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub>. The resulting generalized Gauss-Codazzi equations are identical to 9 of the NP equations, i.e., to the half of the Ricci identities. This result gives a geometrical meaning to the entire formalism. Finally we present a general proof of Penrose's theorem that the shear of the null generators of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub> is the only initial null datum for a gravitational field on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em><sub>3</sub>.
A complete set of harmonic coordinates for the Kerr metric is obtained starting from the Kerr metric written in the Boyer-Linquist coordinates.
The multi-grid method, which has made a considerable impact on both theoretical and applied numerical analysis in the past decade, is reviewed within the context of the solution of boundary value problems in 3 + 1 numerical relativity. The basic principles of operation of a multi-grid algorithm are discussed and, with the aid of numerical experiments on exactly soluble model problems, the method is compared to more traditional techniques such as SOR. The results of application of the method to a set of axisymmetric problems for black hole initial data, previously determined by relaxation techniques, are presented.
We show that the scalar field in scalar-tensor theories such as the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory has an interpretation as a potential for the torsion in a Riemannian manifold. The relation is similar to that of the metric to the connection.
It is commonly held that the Riemannian geometry adopted as the theoretical framework within which observations and experiments, concerning the ‘correct’ theory of gravity, are analyzed is the most general ‘viable’ geometry consistent with observed phenomena. This viewpoint is further strengthened by the belief that the projective and the conformal structures of the space-time together with an additional assumption concerning the constancy of the norm of vectors under parallel transport would uniquely determine its underlying geometry to be Riemannian. We show here that a more general geometrical framework due to Finsler can be made compatible with these structures and still remain non-Riemannian. The potential importance of this result in connection with developing and testing alternative theories of gravity is briefly discussed.
Conformastationary solutions of the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations, depending on one or two harmonic potentials, are constructed. The solutions depending on one potential fall in three distinct classes. Solutions of two of these classes may be combined to yield a class of solutions depending on two potentials, which correspond to the Israel-Wilson-Perjès solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell theory. The asymptotically flat solutions of this class describe systems of rotating electric or magnetic monopoles.
A particular solution to the Einstein equations is presented for an isotropic, spatially homogeneous and spatially flat space-time in the case that the matter field is that of a simple scalar λ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em><sup>4</sup> theory. The solution possesses unusual properties.


The covariant definition of gravitational field energy given by Lynden-Bell and Katz is expressed in terms of Israel's theory of surface layers in general relativity. In this way an expression, valid for arbitrary radial coordinates, of the gravitational field energy in a static, spherically symmetric space-time, is deduced. This expression is applied to the Schwarschild and Reissner-Nordström space-times, and leads here to the same results as those given by Einstein's pseudotensor expression in isotropic coordinates.
The general solution of the vacuum field equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ik</em> </sub> = 0 with a null Killing field and an additional space-like axial symmetry is investigated. It depends on one free profile function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">χ(z±x</em><sup>4</sup>). After some topological manipulations one obtains a new solution which for a special choice of the profile function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">χ</em>(u) is asymptotically fiat and carries finite and positive energy.
In order to gain insight into normal modes of realistic radiating systems, we study the simple model problem of a finite string and a semi-infinite string coupled by a spring. As expected there is a family of modes which are basically the modes of the finite string slowly damped by the “radiation” of energy to infinity on the semi-infinite string. But we also study another family of modes, found by Dyson in a different model problem, which are strongly damped modes of the semi-infinite string itself. These may be analogous to the modes of black holes, and they are likely to be present in relativistic stars as well. The question of whether the instability in these modes which Dyson found is present in realistic stars remains open.
It is shown that the gravitational energy generation vector is conformally invariant. The necessary and sufficient condition for the conformai invariance of the gravitational field equations is found. The conformal transformations of two simple nongravitational energy tensors are considered. It is shown that the conformal factor for metrics conformal to the background is the solution of a simple differential equation.
Using the Gauss-Codazzi equations, the behavior of a singular hypersurface, which divides the universe into two Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time regions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sup>+</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sup>−</sup>, is investigated. The equation of motion for a spherical bubble in the expanding universe is presented and the physical meaning of the equation is clarified. The equations of state for fluids in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sup>±</sup> and on the boundary shell, which should be determined by microscopic physics, are arbitrary in the present geometrical approach. The derived equations are quite similar to those for a shell in a vacuum and can be applied to the case that one of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em><sup>±</sup> or both are Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time too.
The Plebanski metric is analyzed by means of the Newman-Penrose formalism. The components of the Weyl and Ricci tensors and the spin coefficients are calculated. These results are applied to obtain the equations of gravitational perturbations around the Plebanski metric.
We obtain the radial Dirac equations for the Plebanski metric and transform these equations into one-dimensional wave equations. Finally we conclude with the result that the electron and the neutrino fields are not superradiant.
Starting from the Klein-Gordon equation, the single-particle approximation for a reiativistic scalar particle in the presence of external electromagnetic and gravitational fields is performed. The nonrelativistic limit is obtained by a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation on a Schrödinger-type equation. The results are then compared with those obtained in classical mechanics.
We find the general form of a spin-tensor concomitant of the spin-tensor field. We prove that if there are no spinorial indices, then it is an ordinary concomitant of the metric tensor. We also prove the spinorial version of Weyl's theorem concerning the uniqueness of the scalar curvature.


We develop a gauge theory of gravity on the basis of the principal fiber bundle over the four-dimensional space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> with the covering group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P¯</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">0</em> </sub> of the proper orthochronous Poincaré group. The field components<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(e^k _\mu \)</span> are constructed with the connection coefficients<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(A^k _\mu \)</span>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(A^{kl} _\mu \)</span> and with a Higgs-type field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>. A Lorentz metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> is introduced with<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE5">\(e^k _\mu \)</span>, which are then identified with the components of duals of the Vierbein fields. Associated with ψ there is a spinor structure on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M.</em> For Lagrangian density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>, which is a function of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE6">\(A^k _\mu \)</span>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE7">\(A^{kl} _\mu \)</span>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>, matter field φ, and of<span class="EmphasisTypeUnderline ">their first</span> derivatives, we give the conditions imposed by the requirement of the<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE8">\(\overline {Poincar\acute{e}} \)</span> gauge invariance. The Lagrangian density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> is restricted to be of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tot</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ, T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">klm</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">klmn</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Δ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ, φ</em>), in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">klm</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">klmn</em> </sup> are the field strengths of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE9">\(e^k _\mu \)</span>,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE10">\(A^{kl} _\mu \)</span>, respectively. Identities and conservation laws following from the<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE11">\(\overline {Poincar\acute{e}} \)</span> gauge invariance are given. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the energy momentum conservation law follows from the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">internal</em> translational invariance. The field equation of ψ is automatically satisfied, if those of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE12">\(A^k _\mu \)</span> and of φ are both satisfied. The possible existence of matter fields with “intrinsic” energy momentum is pointed out. When φ is a field with vanishing “intrinsic” energy momentum, the present theory practically agrees with the conventional “Poincaré gauge” theory of gravity, except for the seemingly trivial terms in the expression of the spin-angular momentum density. A condition leading to a Riemann-Cartan space-time is given. The field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> holds a key position in the formulation.
We have found a static electrically charged solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in a (2+1)-dimensional space-time. Studies of general relativity in lower dimensional space-times provide many new insights and a simplified arena for doing quantum mechanics. In (2+1)-dimensional space-time, solutions to the vacuum field equations are locally flat (point masses are conical sigularities), but when electromagnetic fields are present<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sup>≠O and the solutions are curved. For a static charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> we find<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathop E\limits^ \to = Q\hat r/r\)</span> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>= −(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kQ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sup>/2π)In(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup> + (2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π/kQ</em><sup>2</sup>[ln(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>)]<sup>−1</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dr</em><sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dφ</em><sup>2</sup> where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub> is a constant. There is a horizon at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub> like the inner horizon of the Reisner-Nordström solution. We have produced a Kruskal extension of this metric which shows two static regions (I and III) with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> &lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub> and two dynamical regions (II and IV) with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>&gt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub>. A spacelike slice across regions I and III shows a football-shaped universe with charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> at one end and −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> at the other. Slices in the dynamical regions (II and IV) show a cylindrical universe that is expanding in region II and contracting in region IV. Electromagnetic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in lower dimensional space-times can be used to provide new insights into Kaluza-Klein theories. In terms of the Kaluza-Klein theory, for example, electromagnetic radiation in a (2+1)-dimensional space-time is really gravitational radiation in the associated (3+1)-dimensional Kaluza-Klein space-time. According to Kaluza Klein theory the absence of gravitational radiation in (2+1)-dimensional space-time implies (correctly) the absence of electromagnetic radiation in (1+1)-dimensional space-time.
Using the notion of torsion potentials, the duality between antisymmetric tensor fields and scalar fields is discussed. First-order actions with these fields, the connection and the metric as independent variables are presented.
We consider a generalized vacuum soliton solution of Einstein's equations with three parameters. Depending on the values of the parameters it is the matching of the Kasner metric with a Wainwright, Ince and Marshman solution, the inhomogeneous version of some Bianchi III stiff matter metrics, and inhomogeneous (and homogeneous) space-times with the cosmological singularity only.
We generalize our previous work, on the gravitational two-body post-Newtonian Lagrangian with spin and parametrized post-Newtonian parameters γ and β, by adding<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accelerationdependent spin terms</em> corresponding to an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">arbitrary spin supplementary condition</em>. For the purpose of constructing the corresponding Hamiltonian we make use of our recently developed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">method of the double zero</em>. Using this method, we remove the acceleration-dependent spin terms from the Lagrangian and, in the process, create new non-accelerationdependent terms. Use of this new Lagrangian enables us to construct the Hamiltonian corresponding to the arbitrary spin supplementary condition. Energy constants of the motion are also discussed.
Cosmological solutions are obtained for a homogeneous, spatially isotropic five-dimensional (5D) Kaluza-Klein-type metric with variable rest mass. The dynamical behavior of the model is studied and a comparison made with the corresponding solution in Einstein's 4D theory. Some important Cosmological parameters are also calculated for this model.
We consider nonstatic spherically symmetric fluid solutions to the Einstein equations which, in the comoving frame, have metric coefficients that are separable functions of their arguments and that have an origin. Subject to the vanishing of the heat flux, we show that all such solutions with shear and non-vanishing shear viscosity have a scalar polynomial singularity at the origin if the fluid satisfies both the weak and strong energy conditions. When combined with previous results [1] we conclude that for the metric forms under consideration, the only fluid solutions to the Einstein equations with vanishing heat flux which satisfy the energy conditions and are free of singularities at the origin are the Robertson-Walker solutions.

The physical interpretation of the parallel transport of a vector is analyzed in three classical geometric unified field theories: the theory of physical space and the theories of Weyl and Infeld. In physical space it is found to be a Fermi-Walker transport in the presence of electromagnetic interactions.
We define an everywhere invariant space of metrics<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> to be one for which the set of diffeomorphisms, which leave<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> invariant, contains all the isometries of the individual metrics in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U.</em> We also generalize Killing's equation to a new equation, the invariance equation, which has as solutions those vector fields which leave<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> invariant. By combining these ideas we give a new method for finding the isometries of a given metric.
A proof is given that a conformally Ricci-flat Einstein-Maxwell field is null if and only if the conformai scalar field has a null gradient. The solutions belong then necessarily to the family of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em> waves.
Over the last 25 years the equivalence principle, in its strong form (see the text), has been rejected when the electromagnetic phenomena are taken into account, on the basis that a charge in a gravitational field experiences a self-interaction force, vanishing in an inertial field. As a consequence, the equivalence principle reduces to an essentially formal principle, with loss of physical content. Since the previous conclusion is not supported by a pertinent analysis of the order of the physical effects of the self-force, such an analysis is tried in this paper for a charge at rest or beginning a free fall in a Schwarzschild space-time. Disagreeing with the literature, the authors conclude that, in the validity domain of classical electrodynamics, no observable violation of the strong equivalence principle occurs because of the electrostatic self-force.
It is shown that as Riemannian space may be taken to give rise to a Poincaré gauge theory of gravitation, the superspace where the coordinates are given by (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>, θ), θ being a spinorial variable gives rise to an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL(2</em>, C)-gauge theory and corresponds to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>= 1 supergravity. It leads to a conserved current and the conserved quantity here corresponds to isospin, where the latter is taken to be generated from conformal reflection. Thus, supergravity plays a predominant role in the microlocal space-time.
The most general Einstein-Rosen solutions obtainable by the inverse scattering transform, using the Levi-Cività metric as seed are analyzed. They can be classified as a family of evolving metrics without a clear physical interpretation and a family representing gravitational waves absorbed and radiated by a massive cylinder. The physical interpretation is based on a perturbative analysis, which shows that the solition waves have a peculiar superluminal effect, on the evaluation of the optical scalars and on Thorne's C energy.
In this note, a spherically symmetric charged perfect fluid executing shear-free motion has been investigated under the assumption of validity of an equation of state. Mashoon and Partovi [4] have studied this problem and have established several theorems giving the properties of such fluid distributions. We find that there is one more solution which is new. It is characterized by three parameters, one of which is the charge parameter. In the limit of vanishing charge the metric goes over to the Wyman metric [2]. It has been shown that the solution does not match with the Reissner-Nordström solution at a boundary and hence it is not suitable to represent a bounded system. We have also discussed the possibility of this solution representing the physical universe. We have found that the solution after a proper choice of constants may satisfy the physical requirements<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϱ</em>⩾3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dϱ/dp⩾</em> 1 but will violate the condition σ/θ≪1 where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p, ϱ</em>, and σ represent, respectively, the pressure, matter density, and charge density of the fluid. Therefore, the charged Wyman solution is unsuitable to represent the physical universe. Thus we conclude that for a charged perfect fluid distribution executing shear-free motion the field equations do not admit any physically meaningful solution if we assume the validity of an equation of state.
It is shown that, as a consequence of the no-return theorem of Tipler, a generic non-spacelike convergent compact space-time cannot admit a closed embedded edgeless spacelike hypersurface. Such a space-time cannot therefore be spatially isotropic and so cannot provide a satisfactory model of the universe.
The Bianchi types of the three-parameter group of curvature collineations admitted by a previously discussed family of type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> Robinson-Trautman empty space-times are obtained.

It is shown that the SL(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>)-gauge theory of gravitation may be considered to correspond to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 1 supergravity and the conserved current gives rise to the Einstein-Cartan action. The torsion term here appears due to the spinorial variable<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em>, which is associated with the “internal helicity” giving rise to the isospin algebra from the conformal reflection group. In this sense, the internal symmetry of hadrons is found to take a dominant role in gravitational phenomena in the microlocal space-time region where the Einstein-Cartan action becomes significant.
The particle content of the most general quadratic field Lagrangian for Poincaré gauge field theories is examined and restrictions on the coupling constants for absence of ghosts and tachyons are derived. Our final field Lagrangian contains three coupling constants, the usual gravitational constant in front of an Einsteinian part and two other constants governing pure torsion terms.
The isometry groups admitted by plane-fronted gravitational waves with parallel rays are determined without use of any field equations. New groups with 5, 6, and 7 parameters arise which cannot occur for (nontrivial) exact solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations. For all 17 possible cases the functional form of the free function in the metric is given. We apply the classification to Einstein-Maxwell fields and also determine, in Riemann-Cartan geometry, the form of the torsion tensor by assuming the vanishing of its Lie derivative with respect to the generators of the isometry groups.
We show that the entropy of a system constituted by a massive Schwarzschild black hole in stable thermal equilibrium with black body radiation is superadditive in Landsberg's sense. Furthermore, we comment on some consequences arising from the negative character of the heat capacity of that system.
The paper presents some exact solutions of Bianchi types I and III and Kantowski-Sachs cosmological models consisting of a dissipative fluid along with an axial magnetic field. A barytropic equation of state (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=ɛρ</em>), together with a pair of linear relations between the matter density (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>), the shear scalar (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>), and the expansion scalar (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em>) have been assumed for simplicity. The solutions are basically of two different types, one for the Bianchi I and the other for III and Kantowski-Sachs type. The presence of the magnetic field, however, does not change the fundamental nature of the initial singularity.
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the chaotic behavior that can arise on a type-IX cosmological model using methods from dynamic systems theory and symbolic dynamics. Specifically, instead of the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifschitz model, we use the iterates of a monotonously increasing map of the circle with a discontinuity, and for the Hamiltonean dynamics of Misner's Mixmaster model we introduce the iterates of a noninvertible map. An equivalence between these two models can easily be brought upon by translating them in symbolic-dynamical terms. The resulting symbolic orbits can be inserted in an ordered tree structure set, and so we can present an effective counting and referentation of all period orbits.
In this paper the theory of integrable double Kerr-Schild (IDKS) spaces is examined. The vacuum field equations are shown to reduce to the single equation of Plebański and Robinson [20]. These metrics are given essentially in terms of one potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H.</em> First-order perturbations of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> lead to metric (gravitational) perturbations of vacuum algebraically degenerate spaces in a direct manner and give results in agreement with those of Cohen and Kegeles [6, 7, 8], Stewart [9], Teukolsky [5], Torres del Castillo [12, 13], and others. Higher-order perturbations of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> are also obtained with the view that, in the limit, these solutions should yield (new) exact vacuum solutions. The success of this construction lies in the (complex) geometric structure of IDKS spaces. This structure induces a natural splitting of the field equations which allows a potentialization of the perturbation (as well as the vacuum metric itself). It also allows massless spin 1/2 and 1 fields to be examined on the IDKS background in a similar manner.


Complex Lorentz transformations and complex conformal rescalings with independent conformal factors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> and<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\tilde \theta \)</span> are investigated in terms of elements of the group GL(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>) ⊗ G<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\({\tilde L}\)</span>(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>). It is shown how a general element of this group decomposes into a “standard” conformal rescaling (with<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\tilde \theta \)</span> =θ), a “pure spin transformation,” complex null rotations, and a complex boost-rotation. Of particular interest are the pure spin transformations that leave invariant the metric but transform the permutation spinors. It is these transformations that, when<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\tilde \theta \)</span>≡<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em>, are responsible for seemingly complicating the transformation law of the derivative operator and of spinors dependent thereon. It has been suggested that to avoid this complication one should allow the rescaled metric to have torsion. It is argued here that simplicity can be achieved even when the torsion-free condition is imposed.
The way a spacelike surface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> sits in a 4-dimensional space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> may be measured by the average null curvature function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em><sub>H</sub> and the shape function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em><sub>H</sub> of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H.</em> Relations between the shape function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em><sub>H</sub> of a spaceiike surface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> and curvature of a 4-dimensional space-time obeying the Einstein equation are investigated. Some relations between the shape functions of compact spacelike surfaces and infinite curvature are obtained and discussed. Assuming some curvature conditions, some results concerning the evolution of closed trapped surfaces from a restricted type of marginally trapped surfaces diffeomorphic to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>2</sup> are obtained.
A cosmological solution is obtained in a 5D “space-time-mass” cosmological model by applying a homogeneous and isotropic metric, whose tensors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i, j</em> =0–4) are functions of both time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, to the field equations in vacuum. It shows that in this theory<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub>of the fifth coordinate is contracted not only by special functional form of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> as in the Kaluza-Klein theory but also by that of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. This procedure realizes the universe which evolves into a conventional 4D radiation-dominated era from a 5D vacuum era.
Theoretical evidence for the validity of the formula<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mc</em><sup>2</sup> for gravitational energy in general relativity is reviewed. For isolated bodies the formula applies to both the inertial mass and the mass as a source of gravity. The formula also holds for the case of the mass density (as a source of gravity) of an inhomogeneous medium with small-scale gravitational interactions.
We study a theory for gravity in which the linear connections are assumed to be arbitrary, except that they are restricted to satisfy the metric condition ∇<sub>μ</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sup>λν</sup>=0. A scalar field is added to the theory, and a conformally invariant action integral, linear in the curvature tensor, is defined. The linear connections emerging from the variational principle contain torsion that is related to a propagating spin-1 vector field, identified as the electromagnetic gauge potential. We obtain a set of conformally invariant equations for the metric field, and conclude that Einstein's equations arise from a particular choice of gauge. Finally, spin-1/2 fields are introduced by means of the vierbein formalism, and the qualitative features of the theory are maintained.
The long-term behavior of Bianchi-type VIII models with three different types of stress-energy tensors are examined and compared. The vacuum model, a matter-filled model, and a model with an electromagnetic field are considered. In each case the existence of chaotic behavior and transitions to chaotic behavior are discussed.
Some general results concerning the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor of space-times whose infinitesimal holonomy group belongs to a given conjugacy class of the Lorentz group ℒ<span class="Stack"> <sub>+</sub> <sup>↑</sup> </span> are established using the null tetrad notation. Those conjugacy classes, corresponding to proper subgroups of ℒ<span class="Stack"> <sub>+</sub> <sup>↑</sup> </span> which contain the infinitesimal holonomy groups of Einstein-Maxwell space-times, are determined, and explicit examples of such space-times are given for each conjugacy class.


We point out that the massive modes of closed superstring theories may play a crucial role in the last stages of black hole evaporation. If the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy describes the true degeneracy of a black hole — implying loss of quantum coherence and the unitary evolution of quantum states-it becomes entropically favorable for an evaporating black hole to make a transition to a state of massive string modes. This in turn may decay into massless modes of the string (radiation) avoiding the naked singularity exposed by black hole evaporation in the semiclassical picture. Alternatively, quantum coherence may be maintained if the entropy of an evaporating black hole is much larger than that given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In that case, however, the transition to massive string modes is unlikely. String theories might thus resolve the difficulty of the naked singularity, but it appears likely that they will still involve loss of quantum coherence.
It is demonstrated that a closed form, time-dependent, expression for the axisymmetric Bondi metric may be obtained through a straightforward integration of Einstein's equations. The solution is shown to be a special case of Petrov Type I solutions having shearing geodesic rays (Newman-Tamburino). The evolution equation is expanded in powers of 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> and it is found that the expansions can be useful in identifying other potential solutions.
Using the dimensional reduction characterized<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>6</sub> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4</sub>×S<sup>2</sup> as an example, it is demonstrated that higher-dimensional Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity reduces to EC gravity with a cosmological term in four dimensions. A new higher-dimensional theory of gravity is proposed that results in EC gravity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">without</em> cosmological term in four dimensions.
Using the positive mass theorem, we show that the connectivity assumption of the black hole boundary is not necessary for proving the spherical symmetry of asymptotically Euclidean static vacuum space-time; thus there exist no asymptotically Euclidean static vacuum space-times with multiple black holes.
The problem of finding spherically symmetric self-similar solutions of Einstein's field equations with a barotropic perfect fluid, which can be joined through a shock wave to some cosmological models, is considered. It is found that such solutions comprise an expanding shell of matter surrounding a horizon with an interior singularity.
In a recent paper David Garfinkle and Robert Wald argue that it is possible to build a “box” which will confine and thermalize gravitational radiation. Using the results of their calculations I will show that the Garfinkle-Wald (GW) box will fail to isolate and thermalize gravitational radiation in a universe with external gravitational radiation. The absence of a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">local</em> equilibrium distribution of gravitational radiation in this model is further evidence that an operational interpretation of a quantum theory of gravity based on General Relativity and traditional matter couplings does not exist.
We give the general spherically symmetric perfect fluid or dust solution with flat three-spaces orthogonal to the four-velocity. The case of dust corresponds to a subset of the Tolman solution. The shear-free case corresponds to the Friedmann line element.
An asymptotic approximation scheme based on a sequence of solutions is applied to a simple model problem of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a scalar field. We evaluate explicitly the evolution of the field off the initial hypersurface and discuss an appropriate choice of the initial data for the field in order for a sequence of solutions to have a Newtonian limit. The study may help to understand the more complicated situation in general relativity. We also discuss an alternative sequence of solutions that may be useful in studying instabilities that occur for large values of the coupling constant.
The computer algebra system REDUCE has recently been enriched by a package on exterior calculus. Here we apply the EXCALC package to the calculation of quantities within the Poincaré gauge theory of gravity, general relativity being included in this scheme as a spcial case. Thereby we simplify and streamline earlier results found by means of tensor-analytical REDUCE calculations.
We develop a scenario in which feeble intermediate range forces emerge as an effect resulting from the compactification (à la Kaluza-Klein) of multidimensional theories. These feeble forces compete with gravity and in general permit different bodies to fall to earth with different accelerations. We show that these feeble forces are mediated by vectors (V) and/or scalars (S), whose dimensionless coupling constants are typically of order g<sub>v</sub> ≈ g<sub>s</sub> ≈ 10<sup>−10</sup> Under certain plausible assumptions the ranges of these feeble forces are expected to be of order 1 m to 1 km. It is conjectured that the general strategy will prove applicable to realistic multidimensional theories such as the 10-dimensional superstring theories. We speculate that deviations from the standard gravitational force-similar to the ones reported recently as a “fifth force”-may be interpreted as evidence for higher dimensions.
The Eötvös, Dicke, and Braginski experiments do not rule out the recent suggestion that the weak equivalence principle (WEP) might be violated at intermediate ranges (10<sup>−1</sup> m ≲<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> ≲ 10<sup>4</sup> m). I briefly discuss the problems inherent in Eötvös-type apparatus in searches for WEP-violating forces (“hyperforces”) between laboratory masses and suggest an alternative detector free of such problems. The proposed detector is driven by a “hyperforce” torque at the rotational frequency. If the detector is tuned to this frequency, the signal, enhanced by resonance, may be detected synchronously. I derive the response equations for the detector and discuss how spurious responses due to gravity torques may be suppressed.
Isotropic homogeneous universes that do not necessarily obey the energy conditions during their entire evolution are investigated. Pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> is assumed to be a function of the energy density ɛ and the expansion rate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>. The phase variable description is adopted and some general interconnections between the energy conditions and the structure of the (ɛ,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>)-phase plane are derived.
The paper gives a list of all vacuum metrics of Petrov type D, which are of embedding class 2.
The Oppenheimer-Snyder model of a spherically symmetric collapse in free fall is generalized to the case in which the star possesses a small rotation. The exterior geometry is chosen to be the Kerr metric in synchronous coordinates, discarding terms of the order (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a/r</em>)<sup>2</sup>. The interior geometry is constructed by adding to the exact metric of the nonrotating case an off-diagonal first-order term in the parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. This term is determined in part by requiring the validity of the junction conditions at the star's surface and, also, by demanding the conserved angular momentum of the source be equal to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ma</em>, in agreement with the value measured by a distant observer. The resulting stress-energy tensor describes a homogeneous, pressureless, ideal fluid (dust) nonuniformly rotating relative to the synchronous frame, which is no longer comoving with the stellar matter. The dynamics of collapse is qualitatively the same as in the spherically symmetric case. Again the star's surface crosses the event horizon when the mass density is finite everywhere, and space-time has not developed any singularity as viewed by freely falling observers at rest in the synchronous frame.
A simple statement and derivation of the quadrupole radiation formula for selfgravitating systems is presented. The primary physical ingredient is the existence of a Newtonian limit for general relativity based upon a family of outgoing null cones, supplemented by a weak asymptotic flatness condition. This eliminates extraneous incoming gravitational waves that would otherwise obscure the physical meaning of the quadrupole formula.
Models of spherical distributions of charged matter are presented which are static even when their circumference is less than 4π<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>.
The higher-dimensional space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4</sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>1</sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>3</sub> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4</sub> = Minkowski space) is assumed. The symmetry group of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>3</sub> is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em><sub>4</sub> ≃<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>2</sub>×SU<sub>2</sub> “Gravitational waves” produce a symmetry breaking so that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em><sub>3</sub>, rotations in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4</sub> are linked with one of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>2</sub>. Certain components of the metrical tensor of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>4</sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>1</sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>3</sub>, appear then as spinor fields.

The issue of whether the present observational evidence that the mean mass density of the universe is less than the critical density (i.e., μ&lt;1) implies an infinite future expansion of the universe is discussed. Although in conventional cosmological scenarios μ&lt;1 necessarily leads to a universe that will grow infinitely old, this conclusion can be avoided in ways which are reasonably natural. One of these is to assume the existence of a small negative cosmological constant. Another way is to postulate the existence of unstable fields with a long time scale for the onset of the instability. An example is a scalar field with a negative squared mass and ¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>¦≲10<sup>−32</sup>eV. Other examples include fields for which the instability is generated by quantum corrections in curved space-time. All of these are capable of halting the expansion of an open universe and forcing it to recollapse into a “big crunch.
The notions of phase transitions and causality, combined with the standard cosmological model, lead to the appearance of topological defects in the early universe. The most familiar types of defects are solitons, strings, and domain walls. Another type can exist when the spatial universe is compact. When these appear the whole universe takes on a winding number, and the consequences are quite amusing; for example, it is possible that a closed universe can mimic open or flat universes. Another possibility is that the vacuum has a nonabelian magnetic field strength at all points in the universe.
In recent years evidence has been accumulating that shows that in the early universe matter was in the dense plasma state, possibly associated with a strong primordial magnetic field. It has also been shown that the effect of particle creation at this epoch is equivalent in macroscopic theory to the effect of viscosity, of which shear viscosity was much more important and which may have removed some anisotropy present initially. The aim of this paper is to study the Cauchy problem for a perfectly conducting viscous magnetofluid assuming the pressure and coefficients of viscosity to be functions of the density alone. We also study the consistency conditions satisfied by four unknown quantities on the initial Cauchy hypersurface and show that hydrodynamic and Alfvén waves cannot be differentiated, unlike what occurs in a perfect magnetofluid.
It is proven that the plane-symmetric metrics associated with the plane-symmetric nonnull electromagnetic fields given by Letelier and Tabensky [2], together with the plane-symmetric metrics associated with the semi-plane-symmetric null electromagnetic fields, given by Li and Liang [3], exhaust the planesymmetric metrics yielded by electromagnetic fields. A “dual interpretation” to the latter metrics, explaining them as being associated with null electromagnetic fields with source, is also given.
The stability by Lyapunov of the circular motion of spinning test bodies in a Lense-Thirring field has been investigated. For Papapetrou's equations the generalized supplementary conditions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">oi</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">o</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kS</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ij</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=const.,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i, j</em> = 1, 2, 3 have been chosen. Four of the first integrals of motion have been indicated. The existence, stability, and instability regions have been found. It is shown that the positions of stability and instability ranges depend considerably upon the type of supplementary conditions.
We discuss an extended version of the Belinsky-Zakharov method, applied on the self-dual<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(n) gauge fields, which is based on a scattering matrix<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> with an arbitrary number of poles of arbitrary order. Conditions for the symmetry of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ab</sub> are derived and particular examples on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(3) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(5) are calculated.
Solutions of Laplace's equation at spatial infinity can be related to solutions of Maxwell's equations in space-time. In this paper it is shown that half of these spi-harmonic solutions correspond to electromagnetic fields with singularities on the light cone.
We study the thermal properties and the thermodynamical equilibrium fluctuations of a gas of massive heterotic string excitations at Planck energy scales. The behavior of this system parallels in several ways that of massive Schwarzschild black holes. We briefly comment on its possible influence on primeval entropy generation.
A new exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equations describing the spacetime following the collision of two plane impulsive gravitational waves, each supporting a plane gravitational wave, is obtained. The solution has been extended prior to the instant of collision and the main features of the resulting space-time have been analyzed, using the Newman-Penrose formalism. It is shown that the result of the collision is the development of a singularity of the spacetime due to the simultaneous focussing of the two plane waves.
The inverse scattering method is used to obtain a class of solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations describing the space-time following the collision of two gravitational plane waves. The general features of these solutions are analyzed in terms of the behavior of the Weyl scalars, and some degenerate cases are discussed.


In a recent article, De Ritis and Guccioni claimed to give an easy way of falsifying the conventionalist interpretation of the definition of simultaneity of distant events within an inertial system. For a particular closed light path, they derived a necessary condition and claimed that it could be violated by a nonstandard choice of the definition of simultaneity. It is pointed out here that (as shown by many authors) the possibility of a nonstandard definition is implicitly contained in a generally covariant formulation of the special theory of relativity, and it is shown that conditions such as the one they derived are satisfied automatically. The most general position-independent definition of simultaneity is given, and an example of a position- as well as direction-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dependent</em> definition is exhibited in an Appendix. A number of objections against the possibility of a nonstandard definition of simultaneity raised by various authors are discussed and are found to lack any physical or mathematical justification.
This paper recalls the mathematical conditions to which the connecting parameters of any finite set of synchronized isochronous clocks are subject and presents the general solution of the light-signal round-trip equations. It concludes with remarks on nonstandard synchrony of infinite sets of clocks.
Alternative gravitational theories” based on Lagrangian densities that depend in a nonlinear way on the Ricci tensor of a metric are considered. It is shown that, provided certain weak regularity conditions are met, any such theory is equivalent, from the Hamiltonian point of view, to the standard Einstein theory for a new metric (which, roughly speaking, coincides with the momentum canonically conjugated to the original metric), interacting with external matterfields whose nature depends on the original Lagrangian density.
The application of the generalized Bäcklund transformation to the projective field theory equations for stationary axisymmetric vacuum fields leads us to an explicit formula for the electric, magnetic, rotational, gravitational, and scalar potentials of new exact solutions generated from an arbitrary seed solution.
By accepting the validity of certain conjectures in classical general relativity and kinetic theory, it is argued that, in a sense, the spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models are unique. This is accomplished in two steps. First, there is reason to believe that kinetic theory requires perfect fluids to be shear-free. Second, it seems that general relativity constrains expanding shear-free fluids to be irrotational. The uniqueness of the FRW models then follows, since it has already been established that they are the only space-times which represent an expanding shear-free irrotational perfect fluid that are physically reasonable on a global scale.
We give the general solution of Liouville's equation in Robertson-Walker space-times, and use this to find exact inhomogeneous Einstein-Liouville solutions, using the covariant harmonic method of Ellis, Matravers and Treciokas [1]. The average four-velocity of the gas is tilted, and the gas has nonzero acceleration, shear, energy flux, and anisotropic stress.
A recent reanalysis of the original Eotvos experiment suggests the existence of a repulsive intermdiate-range deviation from Newtonian gravity with coupling strength on the order of ∼7.2×10<sup>−3</sup> and a range on the order of 200 m. If such a force exists it would induce a test mass in the interior of a laboratory-scale spherical mass shell in the earth's orbit to undergo linear harmonic oscillation about the shell center. If the non-Newtonian force couples to baryon number, two such test masses of different composition would oscillate at different frequencies. The fractional change in oscillation frequency is more than one million times the fractional change in acceleration incurred by the same test masses in an Eötvös experiment at the earth's surface.
A formula in terms of the exponential map is derived, which reveals for any observer in an arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian space-time the apparent diameter (i.e., the angular diameter) of any distant object. The formula shows immediately the existence of the effect of apparent distortion of the objects. It is proved that this distortion is absent if and only if the space-time is conformally flat.
A model of self-interacting scalar and gravitational fields is constructed, in which the vacuum state with spontaneously broken symmetry arises as a solution of the field equations. The gravitational Lagrangian containing curvature-squared contributions is treated in the first-order formalism. The problems of cosmological singularities and conformal anomalies are discussed. In the case of vanishing Weyl tensor and constant scalar curvature, the curvature-squared contributions may be interpreted as being generated by the vacuum polarization, also in first-order formalism.
Here it is shown how the vacuum energy may dominate the energy density of the very early universe even when the Higg's field in the Coleman-Weinberg potential is confined near the origin at extremely high temperature and the inflationary scenario may start. Also it is shown that supersymmetry breaking may be responsible for this phenomenon. Thus it provides another support for the hypothesis of primordial inflation proposed by Ellis et al.
We complete the PNA program for the ECSK theory. We find the general post-Newtonian equations of motion for the source. The different components of the complete affine connection, the torsion, and the energy-momentum tensor, as well as the conservation theorems of the theory, are developed for the case of an ideal fluid with spin in order to find the post-Newtonian trajectories of test particles exterior to the sources distribution. The main results are compared with the corresponding ones of general relativity.
A procedure is presented for dealing with “fast” radiating systems. It employs a method of matching a numerical solution in the source region to an analytic solution in the outer region. As a test of its effectiveness it is applied to a simple radiating system composed of a nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field. The effects of radiation damping on the oscillator are readily calculated and agree with the exact analytic predictions that one can derive. The accuracy of the “monopole formula” is checked and shown to fail in the fast-motion regime. It is also shown that the asymptotic damping of the system is independent of the initial conditions as long as the total energy is positive and constant. An instability of the system is also discussed.
The basic cosmological equations of the scalar-tetradic theory A were recently obtained. Here, the general matter-dominated solution of these equations (which involve the arbitrary dimensionless constants<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em>) is derived and studied in the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=0. One of the cosmological models obtained in this way appears to be free of singularities (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em>&lt;0) whereas another singular model (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em>&gt;8/3) becomes compatible with small energy densities (10<sup>−31</sup> gcm<sup>−3</sup>). More study about the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>#0, as well as about other equations of state and other scalar-tetradic theories, could lead to new interesting results.
A geometrical unified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation is developed in a Weyl space-time. The integrability conditions of the field equations cast the laws of classical perfect fluids under electromagnetic interactions. The purely gravitational limit of the theory is Einstein's General Relativity and the purely electromagnetic case coincides with the predictions of Maxwell's theory.
This work provides an analysis of all possible solutions to the Einstein equations for a class of spatially homogeneous vacuum cosmological models with (Robertson-Walker) × (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-sphere) and (Robertson-Walker) × (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-sphere)×(torus) symmetries. Using qualitative theory of dynamical systems we show that classical evolution of the models can lead to contraction of the extra dimensions.
A symbolic algebra package is presented for performing computations in the Newman-Penrose formalism. We illustrate the power of the package by using it to carry out a complex calculation that arises in the integration of the Petrov type-D vacuum field equations.
A method is proposed of finding approximately the equilibrium configurations of nonrotating neutron stars without choosing any particular field equation for the metric. The method consists in choosing interpolation functions for the metric coefficients inside the star and matching them to that of the external metric at the body surface. In particular, the maximum mass a neutron star may have against gravitational collapse is studied, and a good agreement is found when compared with general relativistic results.
Space-time is provided with an underlying SL(2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>) spin space with complex noncommutative spinor coordinates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup> which satisfy<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(x^{\dot AB} = \tfrac{1}{2}\{ C^{\dot A} ,C^B \} \)</span>. It is shown that the orbital angular momentum operator has a realization in this space as a derivative operator which can take on half-integral spin values, and the graded Lie algebra which describes the structure of the spin space is discussed. The spin-space translations mix fermi and bose fields and produce space-time translations which are not nil-potent. A hermitean metric with a line element which is invariant under such local<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>-dependent translations is introduced.

Mallett has generalized the Vaidya metric as well as the deSitter metric to obtain what he called the “Vaidya-Schwarzschild-deSitter metric” and has obtained the condition under which this metric represents a pure radiation field. The present note obtains the complete first integral of that equation as well as well as some particular solutions.
We show how to calculate pseudotensor-based conserved quantities for isolated systems in general relativity, in a way which allows an arbitrary asymptotic behavior of the coordinate system used. Our method is a generalization of that given by Persides [1], and allows the asymptotic evaluation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum in any coordinate system. We carry out the calculation for the Schutz-Sorkin gravitational Noether operator, which is a pseudotensorial operator on vector fields that reduces to the familiar pseudotensors for particular choices of the fields.
The equilibrium conditions for charges and currents, apparent in exact solutions of the field equations, lead one to regard the Hermitian theory of relativity as the theory of a field endowed with two sources: electromagnetic and color four-currents.
The reversible evolution of a charged rotating ergoregion, due to the injection into it of particles with mass-energy and angular momentum, is studied systematically. As in the uncharged case, a bulge always forms on the outer boundary of the ergoregion due to the latter's angular momentum. The behavior of the bulge's position, relative to the black hole's rotation axis and equatorial plane, is studied, on the basis of the cosmic censorship hypothesis, during the ergoregion's reversible evolution. The range of the permitted values of the ergoregion's linear dimensions along the rotation axis and perpendicular to it is specified. Finally the differences with the evolution of an uncharged ergoregion are pointed out and discussed.
The construction of some real solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations from certain half flat holomorphic metrics is described.
The Weyl neutrino equation is integrated in flat space-time assuming that the energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino field vanishes. It is shown that the flux vector of the neutrino field is tangent to a twist-free and shear-free congruence of null geodesics, which is a special Robinson congruence and constitutes a geometrical representation of a null twistor. It is also shown that, conversely, given such a congruence, a ghost neutrino field can be constructed.
Catastrophe theory methods are employed to obtain a new classification of those world models which can be presented in the form of gradient dynamical systems. Generic sets and structural stability of models in the potential space are strictly defined. It is shown that if a cosmological model is required to be Friedman and generic, it must be flat.
It is proved that a Lagrangian field theory based on a linear connection in space-time is equivalent to Einstein's general relativity interacting with additional matter fields.
An exact solution of the field equations of general relativity is obtained for a static, spherically symmetric distribution of charge and mass. Their physical properties are studied in some detail. Our solution includes as special cases the results given previously by Cooperstock and De La Cruz, Mehra and Bohra, Santos, and Shi-Chang.
For an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs model we study the extreme wormhole solutions. We use an iterative method based on expansion in the radial distance<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> from the boundary of the hole. Here we present the nontrivial solutions of the first-order equations. They give useful information about existing extremal wormholes. Especially we note that although the zero-order solution which we use is abelian, this is not the case for all solutions of first-order equations. The method employed in solving these equations is to expand all first-order fields in the appropriate generalized harmonics. We find a non-abelian solution if the value of the Higgs scalar at the horizon is equal to the Planck mass and if the magnetic charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> and the electric charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> of the hole satisfy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>=1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>.
We present a cosmological scenario with unstable neutrinos which decay into a light neutrino and a relativistic boson. Theoretical and observational constraints severely narrow the values of mass and of lifetime of neutrinos. However, within this range, we can construct models with (i)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em> = 1, (ii) age of the universe ≳ 13 billion years (b.y.) and (iii)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>0</sub> −0.5. The dynamical modeling shows that (a) the initial condensates of primordial<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em><sub>L</sub> are disrupted by the decay, lowering their masses to acceptable values ~10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, (b) the relativistic boson contributes nearly 0.25 to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em>, and (c) there emerge two prominent scales in dark matter distribution, one with a mass ~10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> distributed over ∼200 kpc around galaxies and another component with density ∼10<sup>−27</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup> distributed over ∼ 1 Mpc. The model agrees with observations at all scales.
This paper gives a detailed account of the sectional curvature function in general relativity from both the mathematical and the physical viewpoint. Some recent results are rederived by more systematic methods and some new results are obtained. Symmetries of the sectional curvature are also considered, as is the topological structure of the space of sectional curvature functions of all Lorentz metrics on a given four-dimensional manifold.
Quantum uncertainties prevent simultaneous measurement of the expansion factor S(t) and its time derivative<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\dot S\left( t \right)\)</span>. Consequently the “Hubble size”<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\left( {{{\dot S} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\dot S} S}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} S}} \right)^{ - 1} \)</span> has an inherent uncertainty in the quantum state that describes the semiclassical evolution of the universe. We show that the quantum uncertainty in the Hubble size of the universe is amplified to unacceptably large values in any inflationary process.
The recent work of Grøn [1] concerning charged analogues of Florides' class of solutions is discussed and generalized. The properties of this kind of model are investigated. In particular it is shown that the ratio<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m/r</em> as well as the acceleration of gravity are maximum inside the body rather than at the boundary. Some exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations illustrating these properties are presented. The solutions are matched continuously to the exterior Schwarzschild solution and they represent electromagnetic mass models of neutral systems. All physical quantities are finite inside the distributions. The energy density is positive and decreases monotonically from its maximum value at the center to zero at the boundary.
It is shown that (asymptotically multi-NUT) gravitational magnetic monopoles, which can be described by an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sub> principal Hopf-bundle structure at conformal null infinity (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sub> is a cyclic subgroup of order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z).</em> provide a gravitational analogue of the Dirac quantization rule, which involves the total magnetic (dual) mass of the space-time-a measurement of the first Chern class of the bundle-and the mass of a test particle located in the rest frame defined at infinity by the Bondi (or dual Bondi) 4-momentum. It is shown that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>2</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>1</sub> preserves the asymptotic structure. A definition of the angular momentum operator which extends that available for test electric charges in the field of a (Maxwellian) Yang-Wu magnetic monopole is presented. The commutation relations are dictated by the quantization rule. Various physical consequences are mentioned. Since<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>2</sub> is a double covering of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em><sub>3</sub>, gravitational magnetic monopoles provide a topological explanation for the existence of particles with half-integer spin. Abelian (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>1</sub>), non-Abelian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em><sub>1</sub> asymptotic degrees of freedom of the gravitational field could be related to suitable nontrivial cohomology classes; Penrose's nonlinear graviton modes could emerge as self (antiself) adjoint (Yang-Mills) gauge connections.
The Weyl formalism for static, axially symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations is employed to examine solutions of Einstein's equations with toroidal topology. We investigate a particular family of solutions that contain the Schwarzschild, Curzon, Bach-Weyl, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> metric (also known as the Zipoy-Voorhees metric) as special cases.
We report on a program, written in the computer algebra system SHEEP, for verifying the components of Killing tensors and conformal Killing tensors. We give some examples, including the components of the Killing tensor admitted by the Kerr metric. We also note that the explicit form of all conformal Killing tensors for a subclass of the Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> solutions is known.
We consider an asymptotically flat space-time generated by a perfect fluid source of compact spatial support. Using the de Donder gauge conditions, the Einstein equations are reduced to a new form of Poisson-type equations. A formal iterative scheme is set up to solve these equations by expanding the components of the metric tensor in powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−1</sup>. The coefficient of each power of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−1</sup> depends on the asymptotically retarded time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x, y, z</em> and satisfies a Poisson-type equation. Assuming asymptotic flatness the solution is carried out in the first orders. The results are explicit expressions of the metric up to order<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−4</sup> in terms of the source functions. These expressions hold over all space-time. A further expansion in powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−1</sup> gives the first terms of the metric that contribute to gravitational radiation.
We consider an asymptotically flat and empty space-time generated by a bounded source of perfect fluid. The vanishing of the conformal Weyl tensor on<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">I</span><sup>+</sup> and of the Ricci tensor near<span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">I</span><sup>+</sup> are used to simplify the expression obtained in the previous paper for the coefficient of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−</sup> of the metric tensor after an expansion in powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−1</sup>. The result is a very simple expression for the dominant term of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>αβ,0</sub> in the radiation zone in terms of the quadrupole moment of the source. Using this expression and an invariant definition of the total energy, we calculate in the framework of full general relativity the radiated energy per unit time and prove that the first term is identical with the quadrupole radiation as given by the linearized version of general relativity.
Spherically symmetric solutions with a conformal Killing vector in the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r, t</em>) surface allow the null geodesics to be found with relative ease. Knowledge of the null geodesics is essential to calculating the optical properties of a solution via the optical scalar equations. Solutions of this type may be useful for the treatment of the optical properties of an inhomogeneous universe. We first address the question of whether the large class of spherically symmetric solutions found by McVittie possess conformal symmetry. We also investigate the potential for using conformal Killing vectors to aid in the solution of Einstein's Field Equations.
We introduce a suggestive model where certain quantities in Friedmann models are treated like their thermodynamic counterparts; temperature entropy, Gibbs energy, and so on. Within this model, changes in the symmetry of the universe are interpreted as first- or second-order phase transitions. The thermodynamics we introduce give us a new way of determining the geometry of the universe. By choosing a specific local equation of state (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>=αρ), we show that with respect to the thermodynamics we have introduced, it is always more advantageous for the universe to be in a Bianchi V (open) symmetric state.
The conformal transformations of the background metric are considered and the transformed expressions of the gravitational energy and of the gravitational field equations are obtained. The conditions of conservation of the nongravitational energy are formulated with respect to the transformed metric. Then the background and the physical metrics are both subjected to transformations and the relationship between the corresponding conformal factors analyzed, particularly in the case of conserved nongravitational energy.
A method of constructing a family of regular rotating disks as sources of the Kerr metric is discussed. The algebraic type of the energy-momentum tensor is analyzed, and it is found that none of the disks satisfies the dominant energy condition and, in some cases, even the weak energy condition is violated. Therefore, if the constructed family includes the totality of sources for the Kerr metric with a disk-like topology, then any physically satisfactory source will not have a disk structure.
The quantum and classical descriptions of an electro-magnetic field are connected by the correspondence principle. We consider the electromagntic field as a source for gravity and compare the metrics due to a classical and quantized electromagnetic field. The quantization of the source demands the quantization of gravity. We also show that (i) the conformal degree of the freedom is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> an unphysical mode, and (ii) quantum gravitational effects can exist even when the light cones do not fluctuate.
The Einstein-Maxwell Field equations characterizing a nontitled Bianchi type V perfect fluid model with source-free electromagnetic field are solved exactly in the nonlocally rotationally symmetric case. It is found that these equations admit one and only one exact solution, expressible, however, in terms of two arbitrary functions.
It is pointed out that the field equations in one of Barber's two “self-creation” cosmologies are not only in disagreement with experiment, but are actually inconsistent, in general. The construction of consistent general relativistic field equations involving field variables, such as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϕ</em>, without invoking Lagrangian techniques, requires careful checking that sufficient functional freedom has been provided so as to produce a consistent set of equations.
The electromagnetic wave equation in the Plebanski space-time has been reduced to a one-dimensional wave equation with real short-range potential. We then find that the superradiance phenomenon occurs.
Within the framework of general relativity a dynamics of homogeneous anistropic axially symmetric model of the Bianchi type I is considered for the case when sources of gravitational field are ultrarelativistic matter, homogeneous magnetic field, and fluxes of free particles. Qualitative analysis of the field equations on a phase plane is given. All solutions of a considered type for large values of proper time asymptotically approach the flat Friedmann model while the value of energy density of free particles approaches the double value of magnetic field energy density. Near a singular state the solution exhibits oscillating behavior with successive interchange of Kasner singularities of “pancake”-like and “filament”-like types. It is also shown that in the absence of matter a solution retains its character.
We examine quasi-regular singularities that take the form of invariant two-dimensional null planes in Minkowski space-time, thus extending earlier studies of “conical” singularities based on timelike and spacelike planes. The result is described in terms of a deficit parameter. We also examine the form of the Riemann curvature tensor at the singularity.
The properties of the manifold of a Lie group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, fibered by the cosets of a sub-group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>, are exploited to obtain a geometrical description of gauge theories in space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/H</em>. Gauge potentials and matter fields are pullbacks of equivariant fields on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>. Our concept of a connection is more restricted than that in the similar scheme of Ne'eman and Regge, so that its degrees of freedom are just those of a set of gauge potentials for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/H</em>, with no redundant components. The “translational” gauge potentials give rise in a natural way to a nonsingular tetrad on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/H</em>. The underlying group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> to be gauged is the group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> of left translations on the manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and is associated with a “trivial” connection, namely the Maurer-Cartan form. Gauge transformations are all those diffeomorphisms on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> that preserve the fiber-bundle structure.
We present a complete analysis of the set of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions generated by a vector field coupled nonminimally to gravity. As a consequence of this analysis we can interpret our universe as (classical) fluctuations in the infinite past of unstable Minkowskian space-time.
Recently, Gutsunaev and Manko [6] presented a procedure for obtaining new static axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations from a known one. We show that this procedure is based on the property that the derivatives of a harmonic function are harmonic. The special case of a metric with mass and quadrupole moment is investigated and compared with the Erez-Rosen metric.
We show that certain causality conditions, such as causality, (future-, past-) distinguishing, strong causality, and stable causality have the common feature that there exists a map from the space-time manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> to the power set<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P(M</em>) which is injective if and only if the right causality condition holds on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>.
The status of a classical space-time singularity, when quantum effects are taken into account, has remained a matter of intense interest ever since the epochmaking paper of DeWitt [1] on quantum gravity. We examine here the evolution of quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the singularity arising out of the classical collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud. As opposed to the pathintegral method used to quantize the conformal degree of freedom (see, e.g., [3] or [4]), we use here the traditional operator approach to the quantum theory which is much more direct and appealing while achieving an additional generalization that the wave function of the system is assumed to have a completely general form. It is shown that the quantum uncertainty diverges in the limit of approach to the classically singular epoch and that nonsingular, nonclassical states can occur with finite probability.
Direct calculation proves that the total energy-momentum vector derived from the Møller energy-momentum complex from 1958 does not transform like a free 4-vector with respect to the Lorentz transformation. This conforms with the conclusion formulated by Møller himself, but it contradicts the result of the critical analysis of Kovacs. Defects in Kovacs argumentation are found.
It is demonstrated that the gravitational field of a loop of cosmic string can<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">repel</em> particles. This leads to a very interesting pattern of accretion of matter around a cosmic loop.
A mathematical characterization of standard clocks (i.e., clocks measuring proper time) is presented, which yields an experimental method to test whether or not a given clock is a standard clock. The only tools needed are light rays and freely falling particles. For this reason our method fits very well in the framework of the axiomatic approach to space-time theory given by Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild [1], where just light rays and freely falling particles are used as primitive concepts. As the underlying space-time model we use a Weyl manifold (instead of a Lorentz manifold, which is the usual model of general relativity); this generalization is motivated by [1].
We prove that if a solution of the Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source and γ law equation of state [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>−1)μ] admits an Isotropic singularity, then necessarily the fluid flow is irrotational. This shows the essential equivalence of the seemingly distinct concepts of quasi-isotropic singularities and Friedrnann-like singularities of Lifshitz and Khalatnikov and Eardley, Liang and Sachs, respectively.
The problem of two black holes in a box separated by a partition is considered. Each black hole is in thermal equilibrium with its appropriate black-body radiation. The separating partition is removed and the possible final states of the combined system are investigated. Limits on the amount of gravitational wave energy that can be produced are calculated.
We show that the causal structure determines a volume measurability up to sets of zero measure. In space-time manifolds this causal measurability, apart from sets of zero measure, agrees with the a priori four-dimensional Lebesgue measurability, provided the strong causality condition holds.
The equations are developed for spacecraft Doppler detection of periodic gravitational waves from a single binary star source. Graphical examples are included to indicate the great variety of Doppler signals which can be generated by these systems.
A coupling of high (half-integer) spin fields to gravity is discussed in terms of symmetric tensor-valued spinors for which restrictive integrability constraints are avoided. The theory is generated from a spin-invariant action which provides a means of computing the associated stress tensor. Explicit no-ghost solutions are presented and a covariance of the system under a local conformai isometry group of space-time is pointed out.
I define the quality factor of arbitrary metrics to be used as a measure of their approximation to a solution of Einstein's vacuum equations.
It is shown that vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations, which are of Petrov-type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, cannot be conformally transformed into nonvacuum perfect fluid space-times.
A real version of the Newman-Penrose formalism is developed for (2+1)-dimensional space-times. The complete algebraic classification of the (Ricci) curvature is given. The field equations of Deser, Jackiw, and Templeton, expressing balance between the Einstein and Bach tensors, are reformulated in triad terms. Two exact solutions are obtained, one characterized by a null geodesic eigencongruence of the Ricci tensor, and a second for which all the polynomial curvature invariants are constant.
Massa and Pagani [1] have given a neat refutal to the conjecture [2] that the Riemann tensor is derivable from a tensor potential. Their method consists of assuming such a relationship does exist and examining the resulting integrability conditions; they show that the existence of such a potential will impose nontrivial restrictions on the Riemann tensor and so conclude that, in general, such a potential cannot exist. Although Massa and Pagani posed the problem and interpreted the conclusion in ordinary tensor notation the actual derivation of the crucial constraint equation was carried out in the language of tensor-valued differential forms, and is quite involved. In this note it is shown that the crucial equation can be obtained quite naturally and easily in ordinary tensor notation.



At present, coalescing binary systems containing neutron stars or black holes are thought to be the most likely sources of gravitational waves to be detected by long baseline interferometers being currently designed. In this essay we calculate the characteristics of the signal from a coalescing binary to the first post-Newtonian order. We show that at coalescence the eccentricity of the orbit, tidal effects, and magnetic interactions can be neglected. We also consider the effects of the expansion of the universe on the signal. We show that observations of gravitational waves from coalescing binaries by a network of detectors will provide a wealth of astrophysical information, e.g., determination of the Hubble constant, new rungs on the cosmic distance ladder, estimates of the masses of components of the binary systems, information about the mass distribution in the universe, highly accurate tests of general relativity, and constraints on neutron-star equations of state. Further development of laser interferometers may enable determination of the deceleration parameter, provide new information about evolution of the universe, and even enable observation of such effects as gravitational lensing.
We point out that the celebrated Hawking effect of quantum instability of black holes seems to be a purely semiclassical but nonperturbative effect in string theory. Studying quantum dynamics of strings in the gravitational background of black holes we find classical instability due to emission of massless string excitations. The topology of a black hole seems to play a fundamental role in developing the string theory classical instability due to the effect of sigma model instantons. We argue that string theory allows for a qualitative description of black holes with very small masses and it predicts topological solitons with quantized spectrum of masses. These solitons would not decay into string massless excitations but could be pair-created and may annihilate also. Semiclassical mass quantization of topological solitons in string theory is based on the argument showing the existence of nontrivial zeros of the beta function of the renormalization group.
We investigate chaotic behavior in the class of homogeneous multidimensional cosmological models. We argue that insofar as spatial dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=3 is in general distinguished, the dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=10 is a critical one from the point of view of chaotic behavior near the singularity. A spatial dimension of 9 is the highest in which chaotic behavior can take place, a spatial dimension of 10 is the lowest in which chaotic behavior cannot occur near the singularity. We show that this conclusion about critical dimensions in cosmology is valid if we consider terms in energy-momentum tensor originating from low- and high-temperature quantum effects and from a supersymmetric field in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>=11 version of supergravity.
It is shown that a static solution of the Einstein equations inside an infinite plate of an ideal liquid with continuous metric coefficients and their first derivatives cannot have a plane of mirror symmetry. As a consequence, the boundaries of the plate are joined with qualitatively different vacuum solutions on both sides of the plate.
In this paper, a new class of spherically symmetric interior solution with cosmological constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> is obtained, to which Florides' solution is extended. As a special case, the metric in uniform proper density is discussed. The Robson junction condition is also extended to the case with nonvanishing<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em>, which is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a spherically symmetric metric to join smoothly onto the vacuum metric at a nonnull boundary surface. The new solution satisfies the extended Robson condition.
It is pointed out that the cosmologies based on Lyra's manifold, with constant gauge-vector which have been studied in the literature, will either include a creation field and be equal to Hoyle's creation field cosmology, or contain a special vacuum fluid which together with the gauge-vector term may be considered as a cosmological term. In the latter case the solutions are equal to the general relativistic cosmologies with a cosmological term.
We obtain the general solution of Liouville's equation in Robertson-Walker space-times, based on Killing vector constants of the motion and a new time-dependent first integral. For photons the solution is generated by conformai Killing vectors.
We find all solutions of Liouville's equation in Robertson-Walker space-times that are either spatially homogeneous or isotropic or both. Some of these solutions depend on constants of motion that are not generated by Killing vectors. We indicate how these solutions may be used to find Einstein-Liouville solutions.
The motion of test particles in polar orbit about the source of the Kerr field of gravity is studied, using Carter's first integrals for timelike geodesies in the Kerr space-time. Expressions giving the angular coordinates of such particles as functions of the radial one are derived, both for the case of a rotating black hole as well as for that of a naked singularity.
We present some algorithms to find the explicit form of the Lanczos potential in an arbitrary geometry.
We consider a radiation-filled universe which possesses the product symmetry: (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-dimensional space of constant curvature) × (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> sphere). The solutions of all the types, within this class, to the classical field equations are given. In the case of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-dimensional space of zero or negative curvature constant, the solutions exhibit a tendency to approach asymptotically the Kasner-like state in which the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-dimensional subspace expands while the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> sphere shrinks to the final singularity. Our conclusions based on the phase-diagram method are in agreement with the results concerning the ℝ<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sup> × S<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> universe calculated by Sahdev with the help of numerical methods.






Superstring theories provide an appropriate framework for studying the time variation of fundamental coupling constants. The present time variation of coupling constants in Superstring theories with currently favorable internal backgrounds critically depends on the shape of the potential for the size of internal space. If the potential is almost flat, as in perturbation theory to all orders, the present value of ¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ġ/G</em>¦ for Newton's gravitational constant is calculable and estimated to be 1×10<sup>−11±1</sup>yr<sup>−1</sup>, which is just at the edge of the present observational bound for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ġ/G</em>. If the potential has a minimum with finite curvature due to unknown nonperturbative effects,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ġ/G</em> will become unobservably small. The improvement of the measurement of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ġ/G</em> of 1 or 2 orders of magnitude would discriminate between the two situations. Problems with the time variation of other coupling constants are also discussed.
We show that a self-similar general relativistic spherical collapse of a perfect fluid with an adiabatic equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=(γ−1)ϱ and low enough γ values, results in a naked singularity. The singularity is tangent to an event horizon which surrounds a massive singularity and the redshift along a null geodesic from the singularity to an external observer is infinite. We believe that this is the most serious counter example to cosmic censorship obtained so far.
The Einstein field equations have been solved for cylindrically symmetric spacetimes with perfect fluid source. Out of three models derived, one is static and the other two are nonstatic. Certain physical and geometrical properties of the models have been examined.
A new class of plane-symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid source and an equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=γϱ</em> (γ=const.) is presented. It contains the static vacuum solution, a special Kasner solution and the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime as subclasses. The only class for which the matter distribution is truly inhomogeneous (class D in the sequel) represents matter concentrated around a planar orbit of the symmetry group in an expanding universe.
The gravitational field along the symmetry axis of the Kerr spacetime is examined. The equations of parallel transport along this axis are solved for the timelike geodesics case, and the corresponding tidal tensor is constructed.
A critical review of known results about the permanence conditions for the null character of the solutions to the (vacuum) Maxwell equations, is presented. Concomitants of the electromagnetic field and the metric tensor are constructed, which give the principal directions of the field in covariant form. The known permanence conditions are generalized in order to include<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> the (local) null fields; the above concomitants allow these conditions to be explicitly formulated in terms of the electromagnetic field.
The existence of solutions of the Robinson-Trautman equation is established. If solutions exist global in time, they describe spacetimes with negative ADM mass and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>∞</sup> scri<sup>±</sup>.
We find that vacuum string solutions cannot be embedded in an FRW model in the spirit of the swiss cheese model for inhomogeneities. Since all standard lensing calculations rely implicitly on the Swiss Cheese model, this result indicates that the previous lensing results for the vacuum string may be in error.
We have no experimental evidence for the validity of the inverse square law for gravitation at distances significantly larger than the diameter of the solar system. This raises the very real possibility that the “missing mass” (“dark matter”) may not exist. Instead, the inverse square law may be breaking down at distances of the order of tens of kiloparsecs. I discuss this possibility within the framework of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories of gravity. It appears to be relatively easy to account for up to approximately 10% of the galactic halo dark matter via SVT theories of gravity. With some fine-tuning of parameters, it is conceivable that all of the dark matter can be accounted for in this way.
We are proposing a ground-based experiment to detect the Lense-Thirring drag due to the rotating earth by an off-line comparison between an astrometric measurement of the Earth rotation and an inertial measurement of the angular velocity of the laboratory. It is shown that the former, by means of routine observations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, has already reached the accuracy needed to perform a 3 % experiment on a time span of ∼1 yr. We propose to perform the latter by a dynamical detector of local rotation of novel conception, the Gyromagnetic Electron Gyroscope. Its principle of operation is briefly discussed together with its response to rotationlike gravitational fields.
We consider Kaluza-Klein theory based on the fiber bundle. We obtain the modified Kaluza-Klein metric as an invariant line element of a bundle. Its reduced action includes a higher derivative action in gravitation as well as a term linear in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R.


The gravitational wave equation in the Plebanski spacetime has been reduced to a one-dimensional wave equation with a real short-range potential. We then find that the superradiance phenomenon occurs.
The irrotational Bianchi V cosmological model under the influence of both shear and bulk viscosity, together with heat flux, has been studied. Exact solutions for the model are obtained with three assumptions of which the first two relate the matter density, shear scalar, and expansion scalar and the third is a barotropic equation of state, connecting the matter density and thermodynamic pressure. The properties of the solutions are studied and the temperature distribution is also given explicitly. It has been observed that along with the viscosity, heat flux further adds to the rate of entropy increase.
Let (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H, h</em>) be a Riemannian manifold and let<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>∶<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>→(0,∞) be a smooth function. The Lorentzian warped product (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a,b</em>)<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> </sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>, -∞⩽a&lt;b⩽∞, with metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=(−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup>)⊕<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> is called a standard static spacetime. We investigate conditions on the warping function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> which guarantee that a standard static spacetime (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a,b</em>)<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> </sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> satisfies certain of the energy conditions from general relativity. Also, if (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H, h</em>) is a complete, finite volume Riemannian manifold with nonpositive Ricci curvature and the gradient of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> never vanishes on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>, then (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a, b</em>)<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> </sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> cannot satisfy the null convergence condition.
The Reissner-Nordström repulsion is shown to be a consequence of Poincaré stresses in a static, charged object. The strong energy condition implies that the Reissner-Nordström repulsions do not stop a neutral test particle, falling freely from rest at infinity in the fields of a charged body, before it hits the surface of the body. However, if the particle falls from rest at a sufficiently small height above the surface of the body, it will not reach the surface due to the Reissner-Nordström repulsion.
It is fairly well-known that nonstationary spacetimes exist which are filled with a nonrotating and nonexpanding perfect fluid, provided the fluid does not admit an equation of state. It is less well-known that the same is true when an equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">does</em> exist. Even when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> possible invariants of a perfect fluid solution depend on a single spatial coordinate only, the corresponding solutions need not be stationary.
A classical, Poincaré invariant dynamical system is developed which contains, besides the natural metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub>, an “induced” metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub> that is generated by a real scalar dynamical field. It is shown that scalar fields whose dynamics are governed by the induced metric can be consistently introduced. Also, point particles which follow timelike quasi-geodesic trajectories can be introduced. The reaction forces acting on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μv</em> </sub> due to the presence of these fields and particles are computed. A discussion of causality and geometrical confinement is given.
The potential role of boost-rotation symmetric vacuum spacetimes as test beds for numerical studies of gravitational radiation is discussed. For application to null cone evolution codes, these spacetimes are analyzed in terms of their data on the preferred null cone left invariant by the symmetry group. On this cone, an explicit solution of the Bondi hypersurface and evolution equations is found. This solution has a smooth vertex, a smooth interior, and, except for polar singularities, admits a well-defined<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℐ</em><sup>+</sup>.
The results of two different approaches to the late-time behavior of primordial gravitational radiation are compared. Using asymptotic expansion in time of the tetrad components of the Riemann tensor one finds that initially chaotic behavior transfers itself into a radiative gravitational field of Petrov type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>→∞. On the other hand, to accomplish the physical picture, we study the high-frequency behavior of the field variables in the same formalism. We show that the background spacetime is of general Petrov type I, and then calculate the tetrad components of the stress-energy tensor induced by the “disappeared” radiation with the help of Newman-Penrose equations.
Berman presented elsewhere a law of variation for Hubble's parameter that yields constant deceleration parameter models of the universe. By analyzing Einstein, Pryce-Hoyle and Brans-Dicke cosmologies, we derive here the necessary relations in each model, considering a perfect fluid.

With the use of the equations of motion of massless fields moving in a curved Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, we show, in some simple cases, that the energy-momentum tensor of a maximally 3-space symmetric distribution of the fields (i.e., an incoherent averaging over a complete set of modes of the field propagating in a Robertson-Walker background) has the standard perfect fluid form. As far as we know such an explicit demonstration, as well as the establishment of the compatibility of the equations of motion of the gravitational field with such an incoherently averaged source in the standard cosmology, has not previously been presented in the literature. Our results are found to hold for any value of the spatial curvature of the universe.
With the help of dynamical system methods the stability of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R×S</em><sup>3</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>D</sup> solutions (where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>D</sup> are maximally symmetric spaces) with the static microspace and the energy-momentum tensor determined by unifying theories is investigated. The general stability criterion is given and the significance of certain particular cosmological solutions is discussed.
A simple derivation of the probability distributions for the emission of bosons and fermions from a black hole is given. The derivation is based upon the generalized treatment of barrier penetration introduced by Damour and Ruffini. The intuitive amplitude method of Feynman is employed to establish the intimate connection between the statistics of the particles and their spectral distributions.
A gravitational potential difference between the two components of a split fermion or boson beam in a particle interferometer modulates the cross-correlation in particle fluctuations and the variance in difference counts of the two output beams received at two detectors. The gravitational potential difference also modulates the conditional probability that a fermion will be received at a single detector given that one has been registered at an earlier time. The proposed effects are particle analogues of the optical Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiments; they represent a new kind of intrinsically nonrelativistic gravitationally induced quantum interference different in concept and in observational procedure from that of the Colella-Werner-Overhauser experiment. The effects should be observable with field-emission electron beams and slow neutron beams.
In the framework of the simple (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1) supergravity, a definition of a spacetime symmetry is discussed. It is shown to have a smooth relativistic limit. As an application, the problem of the plane wave in supergravity is studied.
Einstein's field equations are solved with a two-parameter family of classical strings as the source for the gravitational field. The solutions have Kantowski-Sachs symmetry. The singularities of the solutions and the kinematical properties of the string world sheets are discussed.
The implications of Bianchi identities pertaining to the spacetime of relativistic ferrofluid with infinite conductivity and variable magnetic permeability are investigated. Some kinematical and dynamical corollaries emerging out of a preferred geometrical symmetry called an isometry with respect to the flow vector and the magnetic field vector are developed.
The spacetimes corresponding to a weak version of the cosmological principle are considered. It appears that, starting from very different criteria, they were already obtained by Stephani and studied by Krasinski and Barnes. The only barotropic universes of this class are the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ones. Among the others, some admit a general thermodynamic scheme; it is shown that, as for barotropic fluids, such a scheme also imposes additional symmetries.
The geometrical aspect of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1 dilatation supergravity is here studied from the point of view of the internal structure of matter. It is shown that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1 supergravity may be taken to have arisen from the internal helicity of hadrons and gives rise to a torsion term in the gravitational action. This formalism is found to be in conformity with the chiral formalism of superfield developed by other authors.
It is shown that the isentropic perfect fluid subclass of Buchdahl's exact solution for a gaseous relativistic star is unstable.
A family of axisymmetric asymptotically flat solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations is presented. In a particular case we obtain a magnetostatic solution which reduces to the well-known Schwarzschild metric in the absence of a magnetic field and describes the exterior gravitational field of a massive magnetic dipole moment.
In an Einstein-Yang-Mills field theory the field equations can be obtained by applying a variational principle to a Langrangian minimally coupled to a Lagrangian concomitant of a curvature form and the metric tensor. As a step in the discussion of the uniqueness of these equations, we find the general form of such a Lagrangian.
A family of spherically symmetrical spacetimes that are transparent to minimally coupled scalar multipole waves is investigated. The concept of transparency is reformulated in terms of the established concept of “progressing waves.” The set of spherically symmetric spacetimes and the family of wave equations for which the transparency condition can be shown to hold is generalized.
We consider the rate at which energy can be extracted from a charged black hole using the “mining” process developed by Unruh and Wald. It is shown that for a Reissner-Nordström black hole the mining rate depends on the mass of the hole (unlike in the Schwarzschild case) and goes to zero as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>BH</sup> → 0. We also argue that it is impossible to achieve<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub>BH</sub>=0 in a finite time by mining.
The covariant derivative of a single massive fermion field on a Riemannian manifold is defined. The standard method of defining free bosonic Lagrangians from the fermion covariant derivative does not give the usual Lagrangian density for the free gravitational field. We express the fermion Lagrangian mass term as a “frame field” term added to the covariant derivative; this “extended covariant derivative” defines a gravitational Lagrangian density proportional to the usual scalar curvature<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, plus a term quadratic in the curvature components. The quadratic term is expected to be negligible at distances much greater than the fermion Compton wavelength, and is of a general form widely studied in recent years. The frame field term used to derive this gravitational Lagrangian is essentially the same as that used previously to derive the electroweak interaction boson mass matrix without using the Higgs-Kibble mechanism.
A numerical Regge spacetime is constructed by way of a new formulation of the Regge calculus [1,2,3]. The results obtained are compared with the known exact results [4]. It will be shown that the approximations suggested in [3] are, in this instance, very accurate.
The cosmological effects of thermal masses of particles (masses induced via interactions at nonzero temperature) as well as ordinary masses are studied. These effects are shown to be negligible for photons. For electrons, however, they modify the dependence of the universe's radius<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and the time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> on temperature.
The extent to which a symmetric, metric connection on spacetime determines the metric is given, and some applications to affine collineations are discussed.
Exact solutions representing mixed plane-electromagnetic and planegravitational waves in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories are obtained. Two extreme cases, corresponding to the plane waves of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory and the dilation waves, respectively, are discussed. In addition, it is found that the five-dimensional harmonic condition is reduced to the usual four-dimensional harmonic condition plus the Lorentz condition.

The null cut locus of a spacelike submanifold of codimension 2 in a space-time is defined. In globally hyperbolic space-times, it is shown that the future (past) null cut locus<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>n</sub> <sup>+</sup> </span>(H) [c<span class="Stack"> <sub>n</sub> <sup>-</sup> </span>(H)] of a compact, acausal, spacelike submanifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> of codimension 2 is a closed subset of the space-time, and each point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x∈ c</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>n</sub> <sup>+</sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(H)</em> is either a focal point of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> along some future-directed null geodesic meeting<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> orthogonally or there exist at least two null geodesics from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, realizing the distance between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> or both. Also, it can be shown that the assumptions of the Penrose's singularity theorem for open globally hyperbolic space-times may be weakened to the space-times which are conformal to an open subset of an open globally hyperbolic space-time.
A general class of solutions of Einstein's equations for the interior of a rigidly rotating axisymmetric perfect fluid is presented, which depends on an arbitrary function. To get solutions explicitly one has to calculate two integrals involving the arbitrary function. The equipressure surfaces of all solutions of the class are spheres or planes. A family of solutions, which depend on four arbitrary real constants, is calculated explicitly. The solution of the family, which is obtained if we assign a specific value to one of its parameters, and which was found before, is futher generalized with the addition of one more parameter.
Quantum effects at the beginning of the universe suggest the variability of the cosmical constant and the effective gravitational constant. These variations may be incorporated into the theory of gravity in a natural way by proposing a longrange complex scalar field similar to the massless Higgs scalar field. On this basis a broken-symmetry theory of gravity has been proposed. The WKB expansion of the complex scalar field helps us to relate the effective gravitational constant to the usual gravitational constant. The proposed theory of gravity has been applied to a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to study the quantum effects near the beginning of the universe.
We show that the field equations of a scalar-gauge theory in general relativity can admit vortex-type solutions describing<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> parallel vortex lines that we interpret as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> infinite straight cosmic strings remaining in equilibrium.
We study the heat capacity of a spherically symmetric distribution of black body radiation when the effects of its own gravitational field are taken into account.
The determination of multiplicities of the roots of quartic equations with (in general) nonconstant coefficients is studied in the context of the Petrov classification of the Weyl conformal curvature tensor. A history of existing algorithms for this determination is given. An alternative algorithm is described and a qualitative comparison to the above-mentioned algorithms given. Following some notes on the actual computer implementation, a quantitative comparison is made between three of the algorithms, using the symbolic computer language Maple. The algorithm is also implemented in the symbolic language MuSimp.
We discuss the conservation laws in general spacetime with torsion and nonmetricity by use of the Noether theorem. We give a general Lagrangian density, which can be reduced to the one given by Rauch and Nieh (1981). The general covariant energy-momentum conservation law is obtained with respect to the general displacement transformation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup>μ'</sup> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup>μ</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sub> <sup>μ</sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup>, which is a special case of general conservation laws. It is shown that in such a case, the existence of superpotentials is assured. The results are the natural extension of references [1,2].



We present an analysis of the geometric structure of nonstationary multisoliton vacuum metrics obtained from a general background using the inverse scattering method of Belinsky and Zakharov. In the case of real pole trajectories, in general the algorithm leads, for an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-soliton metric, to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1 disjoint coordinate patches. We show, by an explicit construction, that each coordinate patch can be smoothly extended to a separate spacetime manifold. As a result we find that there are no shock fronts associated with the pole trajectories and that, contrasting with the situation for pairs of complex pole, there are no structures that can be easily identified with the region of interaction of a given number of solitons.
The general and unified solution for spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies containing a perfect fluid [equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=(γ−1)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>] is determined in terms of hypergeometric functions. A set of four infinitely denumerable sequences of solutions consistent with the energy conditions are shown to exist in terms of elementary functions. A generation mechanism yields the construction of all the solutions in each sequence. Using the conformal form of the metric and putting the field equations in the form of that describing the classical motion of a particle subject to a linear force, the general solution is then determined in parametric form. Closed models are analogous to harmonic oscillators, and their lifetimes are determined as an explicit function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>, both for conformal and cosmological times.
A general class of solutions is obtained for a homogeneous, spatially isotropic five-dimensional (5D) Kaluza-Klein theory with variable rest mass. These solutions generalize in the algebraic and physical sense the previously found solutions in the literature. The 4D spacetime sections of the solutions reduce to the Minkowski metric, K=0 Robertson-Walker metric with the equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=np</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=pressure,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=constant sound speed,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>=energy density), and to the Robertson-Walker spacetime with “steady-state” metric. Some of the solutions, in different limits, show compactification of the fifth dimension. Some extensions of the model are discussed.
Already known results with respect to the existence of a vector potential for the Maxwell field tensor and a tensor potential for Weyl's conformal curvature tensor in four-dimensional spacetimes are generalized. It is shown that there exists a spinor potential of type (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>−1,1) for any totally symmetric spinor field of rank<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. From this theorem we deduce a series of corollaries, for example, that every antisymmetric tensor of second rank admits a linear representation in terms of the first derivatives of two vector fields. Further, some investigations are made on the existence of potentials for arbitrary symmetric spinors of type (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n, m</em>).
In the framework of the ECSK [Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble] theory of cosmology, a scalar field nonminimally coupled to the gravitational field is considered. For a Robertson-Walker open universe (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0) in the radiation era, the field equations admit a singularity-free solution for the scale factor. In theory, the torsion is generated through nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the gravitation field. The nonsingular nature of the cosmological model automatically solves the flatness problem. Further absence of event horizon and particle horizon explains the high degree of isotropy, especially of 2.7-K background radiation.
The problem of two Schwarzschild black holes, one much smaller than the other, is investigated by an approximate analytic method. The critical separation between the black holes at which their event horizons join is found for two cases, (a) time-symmetric initial data, and (b) the small black hole falls from rest at infinity.
In this paper, we try to establish the quantum cosmology based on the Brans-Dicke gravitational theory. The most remarkable property of it is that the scale factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a(t)</em> has a lower limit, where the cosmological wave function approaches zero.
The demonstration of the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild interior metric within conformally flat axisymmetric stationary spacetimes is revised. A complete proof containing the three possible branches of interior fluid solutions is given.
By means of the Landau-Lifshitz theory for nonequilibrium thermodynamical fluctuations we calculate the correlations in the rate of dissipative fluxes of a gas of heterotic superstrings. We briefly comment on the cosmological consequences.
It is shown that a portion of de Sitter space can be expressed in the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em><sup>2</sup>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(t)dr</em><sup>2</sup>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em><sup>2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>)(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dθ</em><sup>2</sup>+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">sin</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θdφ</em><sup>2</sup>). It follows that it is a Kantowski-Sachs spacetime, according to the usual definition. This disproves the statement sometimes seen in the literature that all Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes are anisotropic.
I begin with a Weyl axially symmetric, static metric representing a spherical particle in equilibrium under the attraction of a semi-infinite rod (s.i.r.) of line density 1/2 and another, pseudo-uniform, gravitational field. A coordinate transformation is then used to remove the s.i.r., enlarge the spacetime, and make the solution time-dependent. The result represents two spherical particles (which do not interact because each is outside the null cone of the other) moving in a certain gravitational wave field. It is shown that the particles move on geodesies of the background wave field. The sources of the wave field are briefly investigated.
The conformal quantization method of Narlikar and Padmanabhan is reformulated with a view to take into account the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exact propagator</em> and to provide explicit<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">numerical estimates</em> of various predictions for dust cosmologies. It is found that in spite of the divergence of quantum fluctuations at the big-bang epoch it is possible to construct wave packets which remain sharp from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=10<sup>−70</sup>s, say, up to the present epoch provided the present state is finely tuned to the classical one. Also, if the transition probability from the Minkowski to the FRW metric is calculated using Gaussian wave functions (with zero mean) then the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>2/3</sup> models with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 0, ± 1 cannot be distinguished, i.e., a fine tuning to the flat (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0) model does not seem to result if the conformal factor depends on time only.
A new class of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations with the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect fluid is given. The class of solutions is invariantly characterized by means of the following properties: (i) The energy-momentum tensor describes a perfect fluid. (ii) There are two commuting Killing vectors ξ and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> which form an abelian group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>2</sub> of motion. (iii) There is a timelike Killing vector parallel to the four-velocity of the fluid (rigid rotation of the fluid). (iv) The four-vector of the angular velocity of the fluid is a gradient<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em><sup>i</sup>=−(1/4<sub>c</sub>)ɛ<sup>irkl</sup>U<sub>l</sub> (U<sub>r:k</sub>−U<sub>k:r</sub>)=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">χ′</em><sup>i</sup>. The last assumption is the reason that all solutions of this class can be found by solving an ordinary differential equation of the second order.
One of the problems in dealing with double (and single) Kerr-Schild metrics is that there is a good deal of combined coordinate and tetrad freedom in writing any particular metric of this type in a standard form, and this freedom is not yet properly understood. This paper investigates part of this problem by examining the freedom in choosing the background flat metric for the standard form of a vacuum IDKS (integrable double Kerr-Schild) metric and by looking at the freedom in choosing the potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>, which determines IDKS flat metrics in this standard form. Examples are given of different forms of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> which generate flat space. A slight generalization of the vacuum IDKS metric is also given in which the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">surface equations</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">curvature scalar</em> are zero (i.e.,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub>00</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub>01</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub>11</sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em>=0 in Newman-Penrose language) but the other<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">central equations</em> and the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">residual equations</em> are nonzero.
A study of 4-dimensional volume preserving covariant changes of the metric leads directly to string theory in 26 dimensions. In any conformally invariant theory of such metric distortions, a new principle of relativity is shown to imply that the maximum number of independent components of the distortion tensor is 26. Within the simplest such theory allowing metric compatible spaces as trivial solutions, we show that this maximum is realized by a solution equivalent to the 26-dimensional bosonic string.
String theory [4] predicts that the universe has 10 or 26 dimensions. A salient problem is how the Einstein field equation should be written in terms of these revivified Kaluza-Klein cosmologies. The answer is by now well-known, yet nobody seems to have rewritten the seminal computation in [6] where an unnecessarily involved Euler-Lagrange variational method is employed and, curiously enough, no allusion to the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem is made. We provide a more straightforward argument, which has been inspired by Hilbert's original derivation of the Einstein field equation [5].
A study is made of homothetic motions with fixed points in spacetime. Some general properties of such spacetimes are established, and a characterization of generalized plane wave spacetimes is proved. A general discussion of homothetic motions in Einstein's theory is given.
It has been conjectured that, in general relativity, shear-free perfect fluids which obey any reasonable barotropic equation of state are necessarily either non-expanding or nonrotating. We prove that this is valid in the restricted case when the fluid's expansion and energy density are assumed to be functionally dependent. In a cosmological context, this condition of functional dependence is of interest, because it is closely related to a recently proposed criterion of observational (spatial) homogeneity, which has been enunciated in the Postulate of Uniform Thermal Histories (indeed, the two are equivalent when the fluid's expansion is nonzero). Our result on shear-free fluids may be readily specialized to the case of hypersurface-homogeneous spacetimes, and in particular to that of spatially homogeneous cosmological models. We briefly examine all subcases in which the fluid's expansion is nonzero and focus attention on the one-parameter family of solutions which are not hypersurface-homogeneous.
Considering the axially symmetric Einstein-Rosen metric, the problem of massive scalar field interactions in the presence of perfect fluid distribution has been studied, and it has been observed that there cannot exist any solution for the coupled massive scalar field and perfect fluid distribution for the metric. The problem reduces to the finding of interactions between zero-mass scalar field and stiff fluid.
Working within the scheme of the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble Theory (ECSK) we find the trajectory of the photon up to its third order with respect to the velocity of slow motion sources. For the general case, discrepancies from the predictions of General Relativity (GR) are found. We apply the results to a model of polarized spin and find that in this particular case ECSK and GR theories coincide. We also perform a multipole expansion of the gravitational potentials in order to find the motion of photons far away from localized sources.
The problem of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> identical black holes in a box separated by partitions is considered. Each black hole is in thermal equilibrium with black-body radiation. The separating partitions are removed and the possible final states of the combined system are investigated. Limits on the amount of gravitational wave energy that can be produced are calculated, and it is shown that for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> large enough, as large a fraction of the initial energy as is desired may be extracted as gravitational waves.



Halford and Kerr [3] and Halford [4] discuss metrics which arise as solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations and which have an algebraically degenerate Weyl tensor and an expanding repeated principal null direction. A number of the metrics which are explicitly listed appeared to be new. Here all of these explicit metrics are identified, either as well-known metrics or as particular cases of known metrics with arbitrary functions when these functions take various specific forms. Corrections are made to a number of results in these two papers. An overview of the status of homothetic motions in expanding algebraically degenerate vacuum spacetimes is also given.
A Monte Carlo simulation method which yields groundstate wave functions for multielectron atoms is applied to quantized cosmological models. In quantum mechanics, the propagator for the Schrödinger equation reduces to the absolute value squared of the groundstate wave function in the limit of infinite Euclidean time. The wave function of the universe as the solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation may be regarded as the zero energy mode of a Schrödinger equation in coordinate time. The simulation evaluates the path integral formulation of the propagator by constructing a large number of paths and computing their contribution to the path integral using the Metropolis algorithm to drive the paths toward a global minimum in the path energy. The result agrees with a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation which has the characteristics of a nodeless groundstate wave function. Oscillatory behavior cannot be reproduced although the simulation results may be physically reasonable. The primary advantage of the simulations is that they may easily be extended to cosmologies with many degrees of freedom. Examples with one, two, and three degrees of freedom (d.f.) are presented.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of curvature and conformai collineations, when they are not conformal motions, are applied in order to obtain some solutions of Einstein's equations in the presence of spherical symmetric distributions of matter.
The Bel-Robinson tensor is the most used gravitational energy tensor; however, it has the dimensions of energy squared. How to construct tensors with the dimensions of energy by using Lancoz tensors is shown here. The resulting tensors have a large number of arbitrary parameters, frequently have spacelike currents, and frequently do not reduce to familiar pseudo-energy tensors in the weak field limit. Two particular examples of interest are one with well-behaved currents and one which reduces to an energy pseudo-tensor in the weak field limit.
Real-vacuum single Kerr-Schild (ISKS) metrics are discussed and new results proved. It is shown that if the Weyl tensor of such a metric has a twist-free expanding principal null direction, then it belongs to the Schwarzschild family of metrics — there are no Petrov type-II Robinson-Trautman metrics of Kerr-Schild type. If such a metric has twist then it belongs either to the Kerr family or else its Weyl tensor is of Petrov type II. The main part of the paper is concerned with complexified versions of Kerr-Schild metrics. The general real ISKS metric is written in double Kerr-Schild (IDKS) form. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> potentials which generate IDKS metrics are determined for the general vacuum ISKS metric and given explicitly for the Schwarzschild and Kerr families of metrics.
A term bilinear in the derivative of the torsion is added to the Lagrangian of general relativity to produce torsion that propagates. Using standard variational techniques, field equations are derived with the torsion being interpreted as the electromagnetic potential and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor as the electromagnetic field tensor. The equation of motion is derived from the field equations, and the results are compared to the Einstein-Maxwell formulation.
The sign of the Gaussian curvature of the ergosurface of a Kerr-Newman black hole depends on the amounts of the angular momentum and electric charge of the black hole. It is proved that polar cups of negative curvature exist on the ergosurface. In spite of the existence of these regions of negative curvature, a global embedding of the ergosurface on a Euclidean 3-space is always possible contrary to the case of the horizon where the negative curvature cups do not allow such an embedding. The dependence of the ergosurface's shape (prolate or oblate) on the values of the angular momentum and charge of the black hole is also discussed.
Applying laws of the kind previously published by the author for isotropic models, we obtain an anisotropic cosmological model with a Bianchi I metric. The interesting features of this model are its simplicity and the easy way we may define overall Hubble and deceleration parameters.
Shear-free, general-relativistic perfect fluids are investigated in the case where they are either homogeneous or hypersurface-homogeneous (and, in particular, spatially homogeneous). It is assumed that the energy density μ and the presure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> of the fluid are related by a barotropic equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = p(μ), where μ +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p ≠</em> 0. Under such circumstances, it follows that either the fluid's volume expansion rate θ or the fluid's vorticity (i.e., rotation) ω must vanish. In the homogeneous case, this leads to only two possibilities: either ω = θ = 0 (the Einstein static solution), or ω ≠ 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> = 0 (the Gödel solution). In the hypersurface-homogeneous case, the situation is more complicated: either ω = 0, θ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">≠</em> 0 (as exemplified,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">inter alia</em>, by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models), or ω ≠ 0, θ = 0 (which pertains, for example, in general stationary cylindrically symmetric fluids with rigid rotation, or ω = θ = 0 (as occurs for static spherically symmetric solutions). Each possibility is further subdivided in an invariant way, and related to the studies of other authors, thereby unifying and extending these earlier works.

It is shown that on every spacetime there is a finite Borel measure such that open sets have positive measure and the topological boundary of the chronological past/future of every point has measure zero. Using this measure volume, functions are defined. It is shown that they are semicontinuous, and the set of points at which they are discontinuous is a union of nullgeodesics. The following causality conditions are characterized in terms of their properties: chronological, distinguishing, strongly causal, causally continuous, globally hyperbolic.
The aim of this article is to present one more possible derivation of the Einstein's equations of general relativity. The new route is based on old concepts of continuum mechanics, extended to four spacetime dimensions. Our main idea is to consider Einstein's equations as the constitutive relations of the spacetime manifold. Moreover, for us, the spacetime manifold is a nonlinear elastic medium with extrinsic defects (extra-matter). This idea dates back to Cauchy's treatment of elasticity. In Cauchy's words: “the crucial ingredient in solid mechanics is the equation which expresses how the force intensity at any point in a body is related to the change of shape near that point.” We will try to generalize them.
The general solution to the strong coupling limit of the vacuum Einstein field equations is obtained. This limit is related to the theory of symmetric spaces.
The Hamiltonian for general relativity is examined in the strong gravity (SG) limit<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> → ∞. In this limit a perfect fluid moves irrotationally along geodesics. An appropriate SG limit for the scalar field is developed such that the energy density has a limit. The solutions in this limit, which were previously known, are shown to come out simply and directly. A classification of the trace-free part of the momentum is given in the Appendix.
An explicit identification rule is defined for stably causal spacetimes on the set of the ideal points of the spacetime. In addition, the properties of the extended Alexandrov topology are examined.
The definition of a spacetime symmetry, developed in a previous paper in the framework of simple (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1) supergravity, is extended to the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2 theory. As an application, the properties of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2 plane wave are studied. The mathematically related question of defining the Lie derivative of a spinor is also considered.
The field equations of general relativity are symmetrized in a manner similar to Dirac's symmetrization of electromagnetism. This symmetrization allows us to predict the existence of a gravitational, magnetic-like mass which we call dual mass. Time-independent solutions for both rotating and nonrotating sources are constructed for these generalized equations. The gravitational field produced by the dual mass source is compared with the gravitational field that follows from the linearized NUT and Kerr-NUT metrics, and an identification of the NUT parameter with a dual mass monopole is made.
In the framework of Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory, the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory is considered and it is found that a scalar field nonminimally coupled to the gravitational field gives rise to torsion, even though the scalar field has zero spin. The metric equations stay the same if the coupling constant is rescaled, but the equations of motion of a test particle, derived from the conservation equations, differ from those of the usual BD theory without torsion. The gravitational red-shift value differs considerably from the usual prediction of general theory of relativity (GTR), and rules out the possibility of a torsion version of BD theory for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>&lt;6.
An error concerning the group of symmetries of a particle moving in a uniform magnetic field is corrected.
It is well-known that two complete, orthonormal sets of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are related by invertible Bogolubov transformations and that the Bogolubov coefficients therefore satisfy certain identities. We show that the converse is false, namely, that the fact that the Bogolubov coefficients defined by two sets of solutions satisfy these identities does<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> imply that either set can be expanded in terms of the other. Several simple counterexamples are given.

We provide closed form solutions to the Maxwell equations for the modes associated with the propagation of classical electromagnetic radiation in background Robertson-Walker geometries of any allowed spatial curvature. An incoherent averaging over complete sets of these modes in each spatial geometry is then found to yield the familiar perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor required of the standard Friedmann cosmology.
It is shown that the QCD-Lagrangian describing interacting gluons and uncharged quarks can be consistently introduced in a classical field model involving induced geometry. A discussion of quark confinement is given.

A new class of expanding cosmological solutions is derived. The matter content of these models is a mixture of two interacting simple fluids: the first one, homogeneous and isotropic with equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>-1)ρ, the dynamics of which is given by the FRW equation and the second one an inhomogenous dust. The limiting case of two dusts corresponds to the Szekeres' universes of class II. A large subclass of the models evolve to a FRW phase for all physically meaningful values of the polytropic index<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> and the curvature parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k.</em> A gauge condition, under which the metric is invariant, is shown to exist for k≠0. In particular, it explains why the parabolic model is a peculiar solution in the class found by Szekeres.
In order to study the origin of the fundamental constants and Dirac's large number, a cosmological solution in vacuum is presented in a seven-dimensional universe which is defined by adding extra three coordinates (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G/c</em><sup>4</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">hG/c</em><sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> and (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gm/c</em><sup>2</sup>) to the four-dimensional spacetime coordinates. It has common features with Chodos-Detweiler's solution. The parameters appearing in this theory are estimated to meet the conditions required by the cosmological first-order phase transition and Dirac's large number hypothesis.
The continuous evolution of the Mixmaster universe toward the cosmological singularity contains features that differ substantially from its discrete counterpart. We examine here the determination and interpretation of the Liapunov exponent of the continuous orbit. It is briefly mentioned that this is not the only aspect of the Mixmaster dynamics to be affected when we switch from continuous to discrete mode of evolution.
This second article on dual mass investigates the physical evidence for the existence of dual mass. We discuss three possible observations that could be used to bound the amount of dual mass in the solar system: the Eotvos experiment, the relativistic pendulum, and planetary orbits. The Eotvos experiment is used to conclude that the ratio of dual mass to ordinary mass is a constant. Under this assumption the dual mass effects are proportional to a dimensionless parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em> which is proportional to the ratio of dual to ordinary mass. We consider two effects: First we show that a pendulum swinging in the gravitational field of the earth would be subject to a precession of the plane of oscillation; second, we show that dual mass in the solar system creates a lifting of planetary orbits. Observations of a pendulum should yield<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em> to an accuracy of 10<sup>−4</sup> and limits on the detectability of the planetary lifting puts an upper bound on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em> of about 10<sup>−1</sup>.
The equations for the pseudopotential of Harrison's Bäcklund transformations with seed solution an asymptotically flat solution of the Ernst equation are solved. A new series of asymptotically flat solutions of the equations of general relativity is obtained from the determinants of matrices, whose elements are known. The first solution of the series is calculated as a ratio of two sums of monomials. This solution has five arbitrary real constants. For a particular choice of the constants it becomes Kerr's solution.
We present a perfect fluid solution of Einstein's equations, admitting a Killing tensor with Segre characteristics [(11)(11)] and two commuting spacelike Killing fields. The Equation of state has no physical meaning but is the same as that of the Wahlquist solution,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>+3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=constant, which admits the same Killing tensor, as our solution, although the two Killing fields are timelike and spacelike, respectively.
An investigation is made of higher-dimensional (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>⩾5) cosmological solutions with action of scalar and metric fields for which a matter term is added. We restrict our attention to the most symmetric solutions with the structure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>−2</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>2</sup>. We present the variant cosmological solutions for the symmetry breaking pattern<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>→SU(2)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) (type IA, IIA) and pattern<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>→SO(3) (type IB, IIB). In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=6 case type IA is interesting for cosmology, which corresponds to a conformally invariant theory.
It is shown that electrodynamics can be consistently introduced in a classical field model involving induced geometry.
Wesson has proposed a five-dimensional theory of gravity where the fifth dimension is a parametrization of rest mass. In this paper we investigate the spacetime projection of this theory and point out its scalar-vector-tensor nature. A Brans-Dicke theory with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>=0 is shown to appear as a special case of Wesson's theory. It is pointed out that the task of constructing a realistic gravitational theory according to the scheme suggested by Wesson meets with serious difficulties.
The exterior calculus package EXCALC2, developed by Schrüfer, is used to implement Siklos' method on a computer. By an appropriate choice of the 1-form basis of spatially homogeneous cosmological models, making use of the time-dependent automorphisms of the Lie algebra, it is possible to obtain a compact form of Einstein's field equations for general models of this type. The explicit expression of the equations, obtained with the help of EXCALC2, is given here for two nondiagonal five-dimensional spatially homogeneous models, namely G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>8</sub>. These equations constitute an ideal tool for the study of the dynamics of these models: an oscillatory behavior has been found for model G<sub>1</sub>, while model G<sub>8</sub> exhibits a monotonous kasnerian mode of approach to the initial singularity.
The complete classification of the null Stäckel electrovac spacetimes is realized. For these spacetimes it is possible to integrate the geodetic equations by the complete separation of variables in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
Emission and absorption of plane impulsive waves of radiation by a thin shell of dust are studied. At the moment of interaction local conservation laws apply. An impulsive gravitational wave does not participate in the energy balance. Rather, it is associated with a change in isotropy of the source (absorber). Changes in the kinetic energy of the source exactly match the changes in its rest mass.
Attention is drawn to the advantages of representing dynamical behavior in a stationary or static background spacetime in terms of a fixed reference 3-geometry that differs from the usual one by a certain conformal rescaling factor. The resulting Riemannian metric may be appropriately described as the “optical geometry” in recognition of the fact that “line-of-sight” trajectories are faithfully represented within it as geodesic, at least in the strictly static case for which such “lines-of-sight” are unambiguously defined. (In more general stationary examples the geodesies represent what amounts to the result of a cancellation between the Coriolis-type effects that would cause a physical light path to deviate to one side or the other depending on the sense of propagation.) The application to the particular case of the Schwarzschild solution is discussed: In this example the optical 3-geometry has a throat that occurs not on the horizon (as in the directly projected 3-geometry) but at the radius of the circular null geodesic orbit.
Exact solutions for the gravitational wave produced by an impulsive, massless beam of arbitrary energy profile are constructed in any number of spacetime dimensions. Geodesics can be explicitly computed and, for homogeneous, axisymmetric, finite-size beams, they exactly focus at the location of the curvature singularity found in the infinite shell collision.
Arguments are given for using the deDonder instead of the synchronous gauge in describing the propagation of density perturbations in a preexisting gravitational field. Since in the deDonder gauge the corresponding reference frame is fixed on the background, the physical interpretation of results is obvious, while in the synchronous gauge it is at least very difficult to extract the physical consequences from the results. For the propagation of density perturbations, with large spatial extension, a decisive difference is found between the two gauges. While in the synchronous gauge there is a growing mode in the density contrast (at least for adiabatic perturbations on a background matter substratum with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p∼ρ</em> as equation of state), in the deDonder gauge there is not. The calculation in deDonder gauge leads to upper boundaries for the spatial extension of unstable density perturbations, and thus may give a hint for upper boundaries of galaxy masses.
Since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear, it is not strictly correct to obtain average values by integrating over spatial volumes. Yet this is really what is done in the attempt to fit our rather lumpy universe to a standard cosmological model of uniform density. Consequently, the fitting problem, raised last year by Ellis and Stoeger [1], asks how accurate the average values derived from observational cosmology can be, even without measurement uncertainties. Do they really describe the best-fit Robertson-Walker model to our universe? One of the alternatives to averaging they suggested was that of volume matching. We try to provide a first estimate of the error due to averaging by fitting a Robertson-Walker model to an inhomogeneous Tolman model using realistic density profiles. Comparing the results from volume matching and from averaging, we find that errors are of the order of 10% or more.
We show the noneffectiveness of the classical mechanism of the dynamical reduction within the class of arbitrary-dimensional homogeneous cosmological models. The stability of solutions with the static microspace within the class of Bianchi (with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>a</sub> <sup>a</sup> </span>=0) × T<sup>D</sup> models is also discussed.
We present the class of Petrov-type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, shear-free, perfect-fluid solutions of Einstein's field equations in which the fluid satisfies a barotropic equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=p(w)</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w+p</em>≢0. All solutions are stationary and possess a three- parameter, abelian group of local isometries which act simply transitively on timelike hypersurfaces. Furthermore, there exists one Killing vector parallel to the vorticity vector and another parallel to the four-velocity. This class of solutions is identified as part of a larger class present in the literature.
The quality factor of a metric, defined by Bel as a measure of its approximation to a solution of Einstein's equations, is tested with several well-known approximate solutions. Whereas for some metrics such as the linearized plane wave solutions the quality factor leads to some intriguing results, for others such as the Newtonian and post-Newtonian approximations for the one and two body systems, and also the linearized perturbations of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metrics, it seems to lead to very reasonable results.
The gravitational field of a bounded source is studied as a formal series expansion of powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em><sup>−1</sup> without the use of a gauge condition. The conditions imposed on the metric by the asymptotic flatness and some mathematical properties of the field equations at each step of the expansion are proved to be sufficient for the unique determination of those combinations of the metric components that describe the emission of gravitational radiation.
Mallett's generalized form of Vaidya's radiating metric describing a radiating mass in a de Sitter background has been proved to be the most general. Further generalizations by others have turned out to be futile exercises.
I relate the integral constraint vectors (ICVs) of Traschen [1] to covariant constant sections of a connection at a hypersurface. I find the conditions for ten linearly independent ICVs to exist as the vanishing of the curvature of this connection. I interpret these conditions in terms of embeddability of the hypersurface in a space of constant curvature and I relate the ICVs to 3-surface twistors.
The work of Einstein and Straus, in which they matched a spherical Schwarzschild cavity to an external Friedmann universe, has been extended to the case where the metric holding inside the cavity is that of Kerr, with a small rotation parameter. Families of solutions have been obtained for the exterior metric for the three cases of closed, open, and critically open universes. The exterior metrics are rotational perturbations of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metrics and, in all of the cases, the conditions may be adjusted so that perturbations decay to zero as the spatial distance from the Kerr inhomogeneity increases.

The stability of arbitrary geodesic motions in cosmological Einstein, De Sitter and Friedmann models has been investigated. It is shown that these motions are unstable by Lyapunov but according to Lagrange they are stable. The stability conditions in a finite interval of time have been found. The orbital stability has been considered.
It is shown that, under very general assumptions, no static nonsingular solution of the general relativity equations exists for the gravitational field of an uniformly planar matter distribution.
A solution to Einstein's field equations is presented that represents a Petrov type II electromagnetic null field with one Killing vector. This solution generalizes a vacuum solution previously discovered by Hoenselaers. The solution was found by the peculiar method of generalizing a member of this class inadvertently discovered by making a typing error when checking the vacuum solution with the computer algebra system SHEEP.
Clifford-algebra valued differential forms are shown to provide a natural formalism for the description of gravitational fields in vacuum. The field equations and their integrability conditions are combined into a simple pair of Clifford-algebra valued exterior equations. Conserved currents and de Sitter algebras appear in a natural way. The explicit relation with a recent formulation in terms of spinor forms is given.
A topological description of the stable causality condition on a spacetime is given. The structure of the subsets that, for a given point, control the fulfillment of strong and stable causality conditions at that point are studied. Separation properties of the relevant topologies are also analyzed.
It is shown that the necessary and sufficient condition that an algebraically special vacuum solution be of the (generalized) Kerr-Schild form is that it have a preferred Killing vector. The transformation is applied to a known type-III solution to obtain a type-II vacuum solution of Einstein's equations.
The conventional electromagnetism, which includes Maxwell's field equations and the Lorentz force relation, does not provide an explanation of well-known electromagnetic phenomena, such as the Aharonov-Bohm interference effect and the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors. In this paper, it is shown that the Kaluza-Klein five-dimensional theory suggests a simple explanation of these effects on a unified basis.
The study of the problem of defining, in the theory of supergravity, the notion of a spacetime symmetry is continued. The connection with the formalism of superspace is explicitly considered, and the geometrical significance of the definition given in Parts I and II of this series of papers is emphasized.
We examine the process of slowly lowering a charged particle to the event horizon of a static charged black hole and then allowing it to be absorbed by the black hole. This process is examined both using the laws of black-hole thermodynamics and using general relativity. The work done in this process is calculated. In addition, we calculate the change in the mass, charge, and area of the black hole. We find that the area (i.e., entropy) is left unchanged.


The electrical field inside a uniformly charged, slowly accelerated spherical shell is calculated. The result is used to find the inertial translational dragging field inside a slowly accelerated spherical shell of dust particles, according to the linearized gravitational field equations. The relevance of this effect in connection with Mach's principle and the principle of relativity is discussed.
The class of previously found stationary axisymmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations is written in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>-orthogonal coordinates,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> being a space-like coordinate. Matching of a big number of solutions of the class with each other seems to be possible for a proper choice of some parameters. The exterior solutions of the class are matched explicitly with interior solutions. Also, interior solutions are matched explicitly with each other.
Solutions of the Einstein field equations are considered when the metric is of Gödel type and the sources are two fluids either with or without an electromagnetic field. It is shown that there are solutions that are spacetime homogeneous and spacetime inhomogeneous.
The nonordinary mathematical form of the Schwarzschild metric in harmonic coordinates is considered. The ordinary property of energy density for it is demonstrated.
The route from string theory to a ten-dimensional supergravity/super-Yang-Mills field theory is briefly illumined. The process of extracting a classical four-dimensional gravity theory from the ten-dimensional theory is discussed and a simple model containing gravity, electromagnetism, a dilaton field, and a Kalb-Ramond field is proposed. The equations of motion of a test particle in a background of gravity, dilation, and Kalb-Ramond fields are displayed. Some static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are derived, and some astrophysical implications are discussed.
Previous work on a class of exact solutions to the field equations of Einstein's unified field theory has shown that some of these solutions acquire an immediate physical meaning as soon as one allows for external sources, as it occurs in the general theory of relativity. It is evident that a four-current density j<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>, appended to the right-hand side of the field equation<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(g\begin{array}{*{20}c} {is} \\ v \\ \end{array} ,s = 0\)</span>, has a fundamental role: in some solutions, a string built with this current density gives rise to partons, mutually interacting with forces that do not depend on distance, like the ones invoked to explain the confinement of quarks. In other solutions, for which<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(g\begin{array}{*{20}c} {ik} \\ v \\ \end{array} \)</span> obeys Maxwell's equations, j<sup>i</sup> clearly displays electrical behavior. In the present paper it is shown under what conditions the electrical behavior of a charged test particle can be extracted from the field equations and from conservation identities related to the theory, when sources are appended in the way proposed by Borchsenius and Moffat.
It is shown that the Wess-Zumino term of a heterotic superstring in a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 1,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 10 supergravity background can be given in terms of the torsion of the background in both versions (IA and IB) of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 1,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 10 supergravity theory. The gauge degrees of freedom of the background are included according to the ideas of Kaluza and Klein. Explicit expressions for the vielbein, connection, torsion, and curvature of a space with 506 bosonic and 16 fermionic coordinates are given.
Gravitational bags contain a domain wall outside of which they look compact, but inside there is a solution in which, in certain circumstances, the extra dimensions explode. We show that it is energetically possible for a collapse of the domain wall to lead to the creation of a huge universe containing a large quantity of entropy. This can proceed via quantum tunneling through a “wormhole” region.
This paper discusses the evolution of the nontilted, diagonal, nonlocally rotationally symmetric Bianchi Type V models with a matter distribution that allows anisotropic pressure and heat flow. It is found that if the entropy of such models is assumed to be increasing, the anisotropy density necessarily decreases faster than the case with perfect fluid as the source. The factor that accelerates this decrease, in viscosity approximation, is shown to be fully characterizing the effect of viscosity. The initial value equation and the energy conservation equation for such models are derived and discussed in order to find the solution of the Einstein field equations. A new approach is devised to tackle these two equations and used in obtaining an exact solution.
Finite temperature corrections to open string coupling constant and tachyon mass are calculated. We find that temperature contributions do have singularities (this was not the case in field theory). We study the low-temperature limit of the coupling constant and find that, in this limit, it decreases with temperature. We study the corrections to closed strings.
Starting from the geometric BRS differential algebra in superspace, we elucidate a recently given method [1] for deriving the BRS component field algebras of Poincaré supergravity and we extend this formalism to conformai supergravity. For the latter, the general procedure is illustrated in detail by the two-dimensional (1, 0) theory. In conclusion, we explicitly check the consistency of the whole approach and apply it to verify the WZ integrability condition for the (1, 0) superconformai anomaly.
We study field perturbations in a de Sitter background described by static coordinates. Using Wald's method we obtain a pair of equations for the Debye potentials corresponding to these field perturbations. These equations are solved exactly, thus solving the linearized perturbation problem in a de Sitter background.
The nonquantum treatment of the gravitational field equations at spatial infinity yields formal solutions, one-half of which lend themselves readily to a physical interpretation in terms of gravitational fields in space-time, whereas the other half involve unacceptable singularities when extended to approach light-like infinity. The quantization of the field equations at spatial infinity formally is straightforward, the Hamiltonian being purely quadratic in the canonical field variables, but the discard of half of the classical solutions produces serious difficulties in the quantum version, for which a possible remedy is tentatively proposed.
By means of the world-function, an approximate formula for the relative deformation tensor of an elastic continuum in a space-time opf finite curvature is obtained. The coordinate displacements are supposed to be small with respect to the characteristic measure of the geodesic joining an arbitrary point of that continuum and a fixed point of the space-time. The formula contains all the terms up to the third order of approximation with respect to this geodesic measure, which is the basis of the approximation.
We study flat and nonflat static models obeying the Brans-Dicke theory and RW metric, including the case which considers Bertolami's time-dependent cosmological term. We find several solutions where the density remains constant, while the gravitational constant varies with time.
Normally, pure states of coherent light have equal uncertainties for pairs of conjugate variables. In recent years, however, it has become possible to produce and detect light in which fluctuations of one of the quadrature components are suppressed below the corresponding flutuations of a coherent state. Such radiation is said to be in a squeezed state. We explore the possibility that a strong gravitational field can produce a squeezed state of light. Such squeezing does in fact occur, and we derive an expression for the resulting uncertainties in a high frequency or long time limit. These results comprise a new, testable prediction of general relativity.
In any theory of gravity, the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner energy should provide a good notion of energy. One implication is that compactification can change the Hamiltonian; then standard arguments of energetics cannot give a complete description of compactification. It is also inferred that compactification dynamics should be associated with arbitrarily long distances. Physical reasoning suggests that the relevant dynamics involves the interactions of mixed hard and soft virtual momentum components. This suggestion is studied in the context of superstrings using the heuristic of high-energy scattering, initially at a small or fixed momentum transfer. An argument based on the eikonal approximation and partial-wave unitarity indicates the possibility that Hamiltonians which describe gravitational interactions at long distances on spaces of more than four asymptotically flat, uncompactified dimensions are, in some sense, too singular to define consistent theories. The unique status of energy as an effective charge in gravitational theories is emphasized as the common link among these arguments.


An iterative procedure using Whitham's averaged Lagrangian technique and a two-parameter expansion of the metric tensor to investigate nonlinear high-frequency gravitational waves is developed. It is shown that, as a result of the nonlinearity, high-frequency gravitational waves are no longer restricted to propagate along null geodesics as in the linear theory. It is also shown that, to the order of approximation investigated, the theory is gauge invariant.
The dynamical system approach is applied to the study of dynamics of multidimensional cosmological models with topology FRW ×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>D</sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional torus) in the presence of high-temperature quantum effects. The stability methods developed in the paper of Szydłowski (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gen. Rel. Grav.</em>,<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">20</strong>, 221, 1988) are used in the analysis of typical states of the metric in the neighborhood of singularities and for large time values. The problems of dynamical dimensional reduction, structure of singularities, isotropization, etc., are discussed in this context.
The dynamical system method is applied to the dynamics of multidimensional cosmological models with the topology FRLW×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>D</sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional torus). Stability and typical states of the metric are discussed. It is shown that quantum effects in low-temperature approximations, when added to the “monopole configuration electromagnetic fields,” give a correct mechanism for the dynamical reduction if the cosmological constant Λ is nonzero and if the microspace is anisotropic.
It is shown that viscosity induced by a magnetic field excludes certain Bianchi models. In fact, it is proved that a homogeneous, nonrotating universe of Bianchi class A, containing a viscous fluid and a large-scale magnetic field, can be only of Bianchi type I or VI<sub>0</sub>.
Killing vectors give the linear first integrals of the geodesic equations on Riemannian manifolds and spacetimes, while Killing tensors give the quadratic, cubic, and higher-order first integrals. Here it is shown that the Lie algebra of Killing vectors,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>, is extended by Killing tensors into a graded algebra,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Γ</em>. This sheds some light on the comment by Xanthopoulos [1] on the apparent scarcity of irreducible Killing tensors. Examples are presented of the graded algebras<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Γ</em> when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> is abelian and when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> is nonabelian.
This essay investigates the relationships among the metric, the connection, the curvature, and the covariant curvature derivatives in general relativity. The extent to which the connection or the curvature together, possibly with certain curvature derivatives, determines the metric is considered, as well as other related problems. Some topological aspects of the problem are included and some applications to holonomy and symmetry groups are given.
The stability of finite noncircular and infinite motions of nonspinning and spinning test bodies in the Schwarzschild field has been investigated. It is shown that these motions are unstable by Lyapunov relative to variables<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(r,\dot r,\theta ,\dot \theta \)</span>. The conditions of the stability in a finite interval of time for these motions have been found. The time interval of the motion stability has been numerically estimated.
It is proposed that the gravitational field can be described in an invariant way by its “holonomy set” involving paths in Minkowski space and points in the Lorentz group. The differentiable manifold of gravity does not enter as a basic object but is constructed in a manner depending on the field configuration. Thus there is no diffeomorphism symmetry in this description of gravity, nor is the topology of space-time fixed at the outset. It is therefore proposed that the “holonomy description” of gravity provides a much better starting point for the analysis of quantum gravity. Striking similarities with Yang-Mills gauge theories emerge which shed light on the problem of whether gravity is or is not a gauge theory.
A method for obtaining anisotropic, rotationless viscous fluid matter solutions of Bianchi type I and Segré type [1, 111] with the barotropic equation of state is presented. Solutions for which the anisotropy decreases exponentially or with a power law as well as solutions with average Hubble parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> ∼<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>−1</sup> are discussed. Also, a class of solutions with constant anisotropy and Bianchi type VI<sub>h</sub> is found. The dominant energy condition holds and the transport coefficients show the right sign.

Analysis of the topology of the distribution of matter in the universe provides information not found in correlation functions. Quantitative measures of the topology can be used to test the hypothesis that structure in our universe grew by gravitational amplification of Gaussian fluctuations.
We study a shear-free spherically symmetric cosmological model with heat flow and present a general method to generate solutions. Using this solution generating scheme we obtain new classes of solutions to the Einstein equations.
We consider conformally invariant massless spin-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> field equations on a spherically symmetrical space-time. Precisely when these equations are consistent appropriately defined field components are shown to satisfy wave equations related by a generalization of the classical Darboux map.
The degenerate magnetic substates of a field-free atomic system are split in a rotating reference frame. The splitting and ordering of the states should be experimentally demonstrable by means of laser-induced quantum interference spectroscopy of hydrogenic Rydberg states. This would manifest dynamical consequences of a noninertial reference frame on the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">internal structure</em> of a composite quantum system-in contrast to the observed neutron Sagnac effect, which involves the relative phase of essentially point particles. The predicted level splitting is independent of constituent particle masses; a composite quantum system in a rotating reference frame exhibits effects inequivalent to those that would be engendered in an inertial frame by a gravitational field.
In general relativity, conservation of energy and momentum is expressed by an equation of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">∂ℐ</em><sup>μν</sup>/∂x<sup>ν</sup>= 0, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℐ</em><sup>μν</sup>≡√−gT<sup>μν</sup> represents the total energy, momentum, and stress. This equation arises from the divergence formula<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathop{{\int\!\!\!\!\!\int\!\!\!\!\!\int}\mkern-31.2mu \bigodot} {}\)</span> ∐<sup>μν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dV</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> = ∬∬(∐<sup>μν</sup>/∂<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sup>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sup>4</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. Here we show that this formula fails to account properly for the system of basis vectors e<sub>μ</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>). We obtain the (invariant) divergence formula<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\mathop{{\int\!\!\!\!\!\int\!\!\!\!\!\int}\mkern-31.2mu \bigodot} {}\)</span><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">e</strong><sub>μ</sub> ℐ<sup>μν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dV</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> = ∬∬<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">e</strong><sub>μ</sub>(∂ℐ<sup>μν</sup>/∂<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sup> + Γ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">νλ</em> </sub> <sup>μ</sup> </span> ℐ<sup>νλ</sup>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em><sup>4</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. Conservation of energy and momentum is therefore expressed by the covariant equation (∂ℐ<sup>μν</sup>/∂<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sup>) + Γ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">νλ</em> </sub> <sup>μ</sup> </span> ℐ<sup>νλ</sup> = 0. We go on to calculate the variation of the action under uniform displacements in space-time. This calculation yields the covariant equation of conservation, as well as the fully symmetric energy tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℐ</em><sup>μν</sup>. Finally, we discuss the transfer of energy and momentum, within the context of Einstein's theory of gravitation.
Superstrings have been proposed as a quantum-theoretical framework for unifying all the fundamental forces, including gravity. We consider the question of whether there might be more general supersymmetric possibilities, based on higher extended objects such as membranes, jellies, etc. We argue that all the possible extended objects in all possible spacetime dimensions are quantummechanically inconsistent except for the 10-dimensional superstring and the 11-dimensional supermembrane. These are also the only two such theories that contain massless gravitons and, thus, that can describe gravity at low energies. It is remarkable that the range of possibilities can be narrowed down to this extent. Whether these can be further narrowed down to just one consistent theory remains open to further research.
The most general action linear in curvature and quadratic in torsion for a quasi-Riemannian theory with tangent space group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(1,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-1)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO(M)</em> is obtained. Stability of the flat space solution of the field equations is studied, by calculating the massless and massive spectrum of excitations. It is shown that some very stringent conditions must be imposed on the parameters of the action in order to avoid instabilities.
The theory of distributions is applied to almost flat simplicial space-times. Explicit expressions are given for the first-order defects. It is shown explicitly that the Riemann tensor for an almost flat simplicial space-time contains delta-functions on the bones and derivatives of delta-functions on the 3-dimensional faces of the boundary of the space-time. The latter terms have not previously been seen in the Regge calculus. It is shown that the Regge and Hilbert actions have equal values on almost fiat simplicial space-times and that the Einstein equations lead directly to the Regge field equations.
A modified Tolman mass (energy) formula is derived for spherically symmetric, time-independent systems. In the absence of surfaces of discontinuity, the modified formula has, in contradistinction to the original formula, the following desirable properties: (i) it always gives the correct mass of the system as a whole; (ii) it always gives the correct mass of any portion of the system which is surrounded by vacuum; and (iii) it remains invariant under a rescaling of the time coordinate of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> →<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ct, C</em>=constant. In the presence of surfaces of discontinuity the Tolman mass formula is further modified by the addition of the Israel mass associated with each surface. The resulting formula also has the above three properties. A new exact solution of Einstein's equations which is well behaved everywhere and is, in a sense, a generalization of Florides' new interior Schwarzschild solution is also presented.
By using cylindrical soliton solutions, the nonlinear behavior of gravitational waves in vacuum is studied in terms of a rotation of the polarization vector between two independent modes. This effect was emphasized by Piran, Safier, and Stark as a gravitational analogue of the Faraday rotation. The polarization of the soliton wave is calculated, and it is found that the+mode which was dominant near the axis of symmetry is fully converted to the×mode at some interaction region and then the disturbance propagating along a light cone like a gravitational wave pulse contains both polarizations.
It is pointed out that the principle of equivalence has never been tested with matter of the second and third generation of fermions. A test of the principle of equivalence with muons is proposed.
Schmutzer's cosmological model on the basis of his projective unified field theory leads to a system of differential equations equivalent to a set of highly complicated Abel differential equations [1, 2]. This paper is concerned with the properties of this coupled system of differential equations. The main results of this paper are as follows, (i) We have found the explicit general solution of the cosmological equations for the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>=±5/2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ɛ</em>= ±1. (ii) The procedure of solving the general case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> arbitrary<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ɛ</em>=0 is easily within this formalism, (iii) After having found the solution with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> arbitrary,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ɛ</em>=±1, one gets the corresponding solution<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>= -<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ, ɛ</em>=±1. (iv) In general the coupled system of differential equations describing Schmutzer's cosmological model is equivalent to a single generalized Emden differential equation and it is identical to Emden's differential equation for special values of the parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>.
Exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations are obtained for the case of static and spherically symmetric distribution of charged matter. The solutions are obtained through the extension of a method originally used for neutral configurations and are conveniently matched to the Reissner-Nordstrom exterior metric. The physical plausability of the solutions is discussed and it is shown that some of them reduce in appropriate limits to known neutral or charged solutions.
We examine the advantages and disadvantages of fixing the coordinate gauge to be that of the Riemann normal coordinates by applying the Dirac formalism for constrained canonical systems in general relativity.
We propose the theory of quantum gravity with interactions introduced by topological principle. The fundamental property of such a theory is that its energy-momentum tensor is a BRST anticommutator. Physical states are elements of the BRST cohomology group. The model with only topological excitations, introduced recently by Witten, is discussed from the point of view of the induced gravity program. We find that the mass scale is induced dynamically by gravitational instantons. The low-energy effective theory has gravitons, which occur as the collective excitations of geometry, when the metric becomes dynamical. Applications of cobordism theory to quantum gravity are discussed.
Closed string models have recently been constructed in lower than their critical spacetime dimensions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>≤<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em><sub>cr</sub>. An ideal gas of closed strings with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>≥4 undergoes a phase transition at a universal point (Hagedorn temperature). We argue that solitonic configurations on the string world-sheet (vortices) drive the system into a high-temperature phase where the vacuum is dominated by vortex condensates. Flat spacetime is identified with the dipole low-temperature phase of vortex antivortex pairs. This is a “Kosterlitz-Thouless” transition on the string world-sheet. It is suggestive of a “stringy” realization of the inflationary universe paradigm.
In this paper we present a new method for constructing theories of gravitation which exhibit spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. It does not require introducing nongeometric terms (i.e., auxiliary gauge fields or potential terms for the conformal field) into the Lagrangian. It is based on a theory which initially is locally both Lorentz invariant and Weyl gauge invariant in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> dimensions. It is shown that, if the field Lagrangian contains terms quadratic in curvature in addition to the Ricci scalar, then the field equations allow both the dilation field and some connection components to have nonvanishing vacuum values. Both Lorentz and Weyl symmetries are thereby broken simultaneously.
The Marzke-Wheeler clock is based on the back-and-forth passage of a light signal between two observers who remain at rest with respect to one another. It differs from earlier photon clocks by providing a specific method based on the properties of free particles and light signals for establishing the relative rest of the two observers. The present paper provides an alternative and more straightforward method also based on the properties of free particles and light signals for accomplishing this result.
In this work we investigate an approximate solution to Kaluza-Klein's equations for a charged system with spherical symmetry. We find that the 4-dimensional metric does not approximate the Reissner-Nordstrøm metric in the limit<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>→∞. Moreover, we investigate the low-velocity motion of a test particle in the field of our charged object. We find that Kaluza-Klein's corrections to Lorentz's force could be sufficiently large to be measured. This experimental evidence could be used to support (or reject) the five-dimensional relativity in its present form.
A generating technique is presented which converts known LRS Bianchi type I models into new models of the same type. Starting from the general Kasner solutions new classes of models are obtained which add to the rare perfect-fluid solutions not satisfying the equation of state. The physical and kinematical properties of cosmological models are studied.
For the problem of propagation of density waves in a preexisting gravitational field, the advantages of the deDonder gauge over the commonly used synchronous gauge are outlined. In a background matter substratum with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p ρ</em> as equation of state there are in the deDonder gauge only decaying modes of the perturbation density contrast with arbitrary large spatial extension, whereas in synchronous gauge there is one growing mode (calculated for vanishing spatial divergency of the perturbation in the 4-velocity, i.e.,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em>sk(1),j/j≡0). The calculations are extended to the case of finite spatial extensions of the density perturbations. This is done by expanding all perturbations in a power series of the inverse square of the speed of light with the result of getting a recursive set of differential equations in both gauges for the equation of motion of the density perturbations. The lowest orders of this equation are the same in both gauges, but only in the deDonder gauge is the correct Newtonian limit of propagation of density waves in an expanding universe obtained. The correction by the next higher orders in the deDonder gauge are dependent explicitly on the spatial extension of the perturbations; whereas in synchronous gauge this is not the case. For attaining the Newtonian limit this dependence is a necessary condition. At appropriately large spatial extensions, however exact, this dependence in deDonder gauge leads ultimately to a decaying of density contrast modes growing in zeroth order (at least for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=0 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>ρ/3 as equations of state for the background matter substratum). Hence, there are upper boundaries in the spatial extensions of instable growing modes of density contrast.
It is shown that Einstein's equations for multidimensional homogeneous block diagonal cosmology are generic only if the dimension of space-time is 4.
Exact gravitational collapse solutions with shear and radial heat flow are obtained by integrating a field equation. Junction conditions which match the collapse solutions to an exterior Vaidya metric show that, at the boundary, the pressure is proportional to the magnitude of the heat flow vector.
In the presence of symmetries, conserved quantities can be obtained by contracting the stress-energy tensor with a Killing vector. We generalize this result to piecewise Killing vectors by giving sufficient conditions for the construction of an associated conserved quantity. A typical example, namely, two stationary space-times joined together in such a way that the resulting space-time is not stationary, is treated in detail.



We examine the role which higher-derivative gravity interactions may play in black hole evaporation. The thermodynamic properties of black holes in Lovelock gravity are described. In certain cases, the specific heat of a black hole becomes positive at a small mass. This results in an infinite lifetime for the black hole (and also allows it to achieve stable equilibrium with a thermal environment). Thus no conflict with unitary time evolution would arise in such theories.
A new type of cosmological history which includes large-scale entropy production is proposed. These cosmologies are based on a reinterpretation of the matter-energy stress tensor in Einstein's equations. This modifies the usual adiabatic energy conservation laws, thereby leading to a possible irreversible matter creation. This creation corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the gravitational field to the created matter constituents. This new point of view results from the consideration of thermodynamics of open systems in the framework of cosmology. It appears that the usual initial singularity is structurally unstable with respect to irreversible matter creation. The corresponding cosmological history therefore starts from an instability of the vacuum rather than from a singularity. The universe evolves through an inflationary phase. This appears to be an attractor independent of the initial vacuum fluctuation.
The general expression of the second fundamental form for the instrinsic rigidity case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>4</sub> embedded in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sub>5</sub> is obtained. Some examples are investigated.
Junction conditions are studied at the boundary of a sphere consisting of a charged viscous fluid with outgoing heat and radiation flux. The motion is anisotropic and the matching is done with the exterior Reissner-Nordström-Vaidya metric. A general relation in terms of the energy-momentum tensor components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>1</sup> </span> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>4</sub> <sup>1</sup> </span> is satisfied at the boundary hypersurface and this relation gives appropriate physical conditions in different special cases, some of which were obtained previously.
A cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model with electromagnetic field for perfect fluid distributions is obtained. To get a determinate solution, a supplementary condition<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em>=(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BC</em>)<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> between metric potentials is used where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A, B</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> are functions of both<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> is a constant. Some physical and geometrical properties of the model and behavior of electromagnetic field tensors are also discussed.
A new three-parameter class of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations is presented which represents the collision of a pair of gravitational plane waves. Depending on the choice of the parameters, one of the colliding waves has a smooth or unbounded wavefront, or it is a shock, or impulsive, or shock accompanied by an impulsive wave, while the second is any of the above types. A subfamily of the solutions develops no curvature singularity in the interaction region formed by the colliding waves.
In order to provide insight about the physical interpretation of the NUT parameter, we solve the geodesic equations for the NUT metric. We show that the properties of NUT geodesics are similar to the properties of trajectories for charged particles orbiting about a magnetic monopole. In summary, we show that (1) the orbits lie on the surface of a cone, (2) the conserved total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum plus the angular momentum due to the “monopole” field, (3) the monopole field angular momentum is independent of the separation between the source of the gravitational field and the test particle, and (4) the geodesics are “almost” spherically symmetric. The strong similarities between the NUT geodesics and the electromagnetic monopole suggest that the NUT metric is an exact solution for a gravitational magnetic monopole. However, the subtle difference of being only almost spherically symmetric implies that the analogy is not perfect. The almost spherically symmetric nature of the NUT geodesics suggest that the energy of the “Dirac string” makes a contribution to the solution. We also construct exact solutions for special orbits, discuss a twin paradox, and speculate about the Dirac quantization condition for a gravitational magnetic monopole.
The Maison five-to-three dimensional reduction, generalized to the case of five-dimensional general relativity with sources, is applied to the problem of confining the scalar field of the Kaluza-Klein wormhole soliton by a very weak perfect fluid source, without affecting the spatial geometry of this localized solution.




We construct solutions to the Einstein equations and their sources with a high asphericity using kinetic theory. In particular, we consider all the solutions associated with disk like sources of counter rotating collisionless particles, and find that the hoop conjecture is satisfied.
The time evolution of the particle number density and spectrum of massive scalar particles, coupled conformally to a classical Friedman-Robertson-Walker gravitational field is followed numerically. Not only for a pure radiation cosmos, but also for one with an inflationary interlude, the density of particles produced remains constant in time. This results in a constant equivalent “temperature” scale up to the Compton time of the massive particles, and opens the possibility that during a sufficiently long inflation the energy density of the particles produced can exceed that of the radiation background.
An ansatz is developed to obtain interior solutions of the Einstein field equations for anisotropic spheres. This procedure necessitates a choice for the energy-density and the radial pressure. A class of solutions for a uniform energy-density source is presented. These anisotropic spheres match smoothly to the Schwarzschild exterior and are well-behaved in the interior of the sphere.
The applications of spherically symmetric solutions of the massless scalar Einstein equations to cosmic censorship are discussed. A new nonstatic solution to these equations is given. The Vaidya form of Wyman's solution is constructed and is shown to obey reasonable energy conditions.
The time-like geodesics in the spherically symmetric vacuum solution with positive cosmological constant are investigated. The conditions necessary for the existence of bound orbits are found and the motion of particles is related to their position in the conformal diagram.
Given four distinct real null directions, a unique (up to a choice between three alternatives) null frame is defined geometrically. When the assumption is made that the four given null directions are the principal null directions of a Petrov type-I space-time, it is shown that the geometrically defined frame coincides with the Weyl canonical frame.
In a spin space, with noncommutative spinorial coordinates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>which satisfy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em> </sup>=1/2{<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>*<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em></sup>}, we investigate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>-dependent spin coordinate transformations which correspond to a local fermi-bose symmetry. A concept of a spin vector corresponding to these local transformations is established, and spin space is provided with a spinorial vierbein field which determines non-nil-potent line and volume elements which are direct generalizations of the conventional relativistic ones.
By means of exponential laws we show a Bianchi Type I model of the universe where we define overall deceleration and Hubble's parameters that have constant values. We employ a convenient relation for defining the “radius” of the universe. Pressure and density have constant values, too.
The conformal factor and a massless scalar field are quantized on Einstein background spacetime. A singularity-free cosmological model is obtained and discussed.
It is shown that one of the two sets of integrability conditions of the conformal Killing equation, as found by Yano, is redundant.
The conventional interpretation of the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems is that gravitational collapse, signified by the presence of a closed trapped surface, generally leads to the formation of a singularity. Consideration is given here to an alternative interpretation according to which collapse scenarios may give rise, not to singularities, but to chronology violation instead. An example is given of a singularity-free, chronology-violating space-time with a (non-achronal) closed trapped surface. In a large class of singularity-free space-times, the presence of a closed trapped surface, achronal or not, necessitates a violation of chronology. Moreover, all closed trapped surfaces and chronology violations are confined to black holes; weak cosmic censorship must hold in the sense that the region of the space-time visible from infinity is globally hyperbolic.
The first-, the second-, and the third-order null Killing vectors in a gravitational field are explored separately. When an algebraically special Petrov-type free gravitational field is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aligned</em> with a source-free (nonnull/null) electromagnetic field, their common propagation vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>a</sup> is shown to be a third-order null Killing vector field (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> = 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℒ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> ≠ 0). When the two fields are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not aligned</em>, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a third-order null symmetry are obtained in Newman-Penrose formalism.
We consider the connection between the thermal effect of a black hole and the restoration of a broken symmetry. It appears that the second law of thermodynamics could be violated in a special circumstance. It is shown that this does not happen if we impose some constraints on the Higgs field.
It is known that distinct solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations may be related by complex coordinate transformations. In particular, there is the class of simple transformations where two or more coordinates are merely made imaginary as, e.g.,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t → iø</em> and ø →<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">it.</em> There also exist substantially more complicated forms of this type of transformation. In particular, it is possible to show that two distinct members of the family of Kasner metrics are so related. These are the Bianchi I and the Weyl W-2 metrics. It is convenient to refer to solutions so related as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">complex analogues</em>.
This article is a shortened version of a preprint [1]. It contains some new methods to investigate the causal structure of Lorentzian homogeneous manifolds (Sections 2–4; for all unfamiliar definitions and notations dealing with Lorentzian geometry the reader is referred to [2]). In Section 5 these methods are applied to the description of the causal structure of all geodesically complete spaces determined by left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on three-dimensional simply connected solvable Lie groups.
We investigate null and time-like geodesics in the Erez-Rosen space-time, that is, in the exterior gravitational field of a mass with quadrupole moment. By using the weak-field approximation of the Erez-Rosen metric, we find the solution of the equation for equatorial time-like geodesics and determine how they differ from the corresponding Schwarzschild geodesies. For the exact form of the Erez-Rosen metric, we only draw some qualitative conclusions about the influence of the quadrupole moment on the path of test particles and on the motion of photons. We derive the relativistic contribution of the quadrupole moment to the perihelion shift and to the precession of the ascending node.
The arbitrariness in the definition of the canonical frame in a Petrov type-I space-time is examined and shown to imply that the Newman-Penrose formalism is invariant under a 24-element discrete symmetry group. The transformations of the N-P scalars under the operations of the group are obtained, and conditions are formulated which characterize space-times that maintain this symmetry globally.

We propose to give a physical interpretation of the Harrison transformations, so far considered merely as generation techniques of exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, as the mechanism which makes a certain class of electrovacuum test fields (Papapetrou fields) gravitate themselves.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-dimensional generalization of Florides' interior solution with cosmological constant and Kotller's exterior solution are presented here. The case of uniform density configuration is also considered. One can get back the solutions in four-dimensional space-time by putting<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=4 in the solutions presented here.
The classical dynamics of the gravitational field in the Poincaré gauge theory is studied. The most general Lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion is considered. The relevant field equations and their solutions are analyzed in detail, with particular emphasis on the comparison of the Poincaré gauge models with the general relativity theory. We investigate correspondence between the spaces of exact solutions of these theories, both in the presence and absence of material sources, and with or without torsion. Some new exact solutions are obtained without the use of the double duality ansatz. The weak-field approximation is discussed, and gravitational radiation is considered.
Mechanics is considered in a universe containing negative mass. Demanding (i) conservation of momentum, (ii) principle of equivalence, (iii) no runaway motions, (iv) no Schwarzschild black holes, and (v) the inertial and active gravitational masses of a body shall have the same sign, we find that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> mass must be negative. Some properties of such a universe are investigated. We show that a neutral spherical body of arbitrarily small size is possible, and observers external to it can communicate with each other by light rays without horizon problems. There are no cosmological models with a power-law big bang, and there is an abundance of nonsingular models. Like electric charges would attract each other, and unlike ones would repel. This could produce stars and galaxies held together by charge and not gravity. The investigation does not suggest any reason why mass in the real universe should be positive.
The notion of holonomic fluid in relativity is reconsidered. An intrinsic characterization of holonomic fluids, involving only the unit velocity, is given, showing that in spite of its dynamical appearance the notion of holonomic fluid is a kinematical notion. The relations between holonomic and thermodynamic perfect fluids are studied.
We present a mathematically simple and coordinate-free proof, based on the GHP spin-coefficient formalism, that a small stationary perturbation of a Kerr solution results in a new Kerr solution. Thus, under physically reasonable assumptions, we give a new and simple proof that a stationary black hole is given by a Kerr solution.
The ground state for Kaluza-Klein cosmological models with more than one dilaton field is considered. The dimensional reduction is performed and the equations of motion for the dilaton fields are considered. The normal modes of oscillation are found, one of them,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em>, being the conformai factor in front of the metric for the true four-dimensional space-time. It is shown that a stable minimum exists when both the cosmological term and all the scalar curvatures of the extra-dimensional subspaces are negative. If all these scalar curvatures are positive, the extra-dimensional subspaces collapse and the quantum effects should be taken into account to stabilize them. All other combinations of the signs of scalar curvatures lead to decompactification of some of the subspaces. Some cosmological applications are discussed. One of them concerns the possibility of constructing Big-Bang cosmological models starting from a nonsingular higher-dimensional space-time.
It is shown that a generalization of the procedure given in [1] for construction of the gravitational multipoles leads to the same Newtonian limit as the generalized Erez-Rosen solution [2].




We first show that the chaos-generating terms are absent from the vacuum field equations in the case of the general Bianchi VI and VII cosmological models. According to recent studies, this proves that the Kasnerian metric is a general solution for these models in the neighborhood of the initial singularity. Then, using a method developed by Jantzen, we reduce the field equations to a nonautonomous system of order two. A numerical integration leads to the explicit four-parameter asymptotic form of a general solution, which is indeed Kasnerian in the canonical invariant basis.
It is shown that important space-time structure conditions of stable causality and strong causality are characterized in terms of causal functions.
This paper presents an analysis of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum for the problem of head-on collision of two Schwarzschild black holes, of which one is much smaller than the other. Based on the decomposition of the metric perturbations into spherical harmonics, introduced by Regge and Wheeler, we give some time-symmetric initial data and calculate the subsequent time-evolution of gravitational field. It is found that the small hole, initially at rest, begins to move like a freely falling particle. A wave-like disturbance generated near the small hole grows up and propagates in the direction opposite to the hole's motion. We investigate the area of the large Schwarzschild horizon distorted by the small hole to obtain the rate of increase with time.
By considering the Robertson-Walker, line element exact solutions are obtained for radiation-filled cosmological differential equations of Brans-Dicke theory with the assumption that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k/k = 1/R</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> denotes the gravitational variable and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> is the radius of curvature and the dot denotes the differentiation with respect to time. Under this assumption, we obtain exact solutions corresponding to the three values of curvature index<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> (1,0, −1). We can obtain physically realistic solutions in all the three cases for all values of coupling constant ω &gt; −2. The radius of curvature increases linearly with respect to the age of the universe, while the gravitational variable<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> varies directly as the square of the radius of the universe. The solution obtained contradicts Dirac's hypothesis in which the gravitational constant should decrease with time in the expanding universe.
The general relativistic barometric formulas of a perfect charged relativistic ther modynamical fluid with constant magnetic permeability and infinite conductivity are deduced if the space-time, in which this fluid is moving, has two Killing vector fields: the first collinear to the 4-velocity with the second one proportional to the magnetic field.
The study of Bianchi class A models is completed with the study of type B models. The theorems of Hughston and Jacobs, and Tsoubelis are sharpened by taking viscosity into account. By confronting theory with observation, it is shown that a homogeneous, nonrotating viscous universe with a large-scale magnetic field can only be of Bianchi type I.
The existence of “radial” conformai Killing (RCK) vector fields is discussed for metrics describing spherically symmetric, shear-free, perfect fluids. It is shown that conformally flat metrics admit three RCK fields, while nonconformally flat metrics might admit, at most, one such field. An RCK vector parallel to the 4-velocity of the fluid occurs in a subclass of conformally flat metrics containing the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-times as particular cases. A new class of nonconformally flat, self-similarity solutions is found. The necessary conditions for the existence of an RCK field in other nonconformally flat metrics are given in full.


Bianchi V, spatially homogeneous imperfect fluid cosmological models which contain both viscosity and heat flow are investigated. The Einstein field equations are established in the case that the equations of state are given by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>-(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>-1)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ζ</em>=ζ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">o ρ</em><sup>m</sup>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ηoρ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> (where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>, ζ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">o</em>, η<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">o</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> are constants). The physical constraints on the solutions of the Einstein field equations, and, in particular, the thermodynamical laws and energy conditions that govern such solutions, are discussed in some detail. Simple power law solutions and solutions in which there is no heat conduction are studied first. Exact solutions are then investigated in more generality, and it is shown that there exist two first integrals of the field equations for certain values of the physical parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ, m</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. Finally, it is shown that in a special case of interest (in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 1/2) the imperfect fluid Bianchi V field equations can be written as a plane-autonomous system, thus facilitating the qualitative analysis of these cosmological models.
In this paper we investigate the (static) solution of the Kaluza-Klein equations for a cylindrically symmetric current distribution. Specifically, we are interested in the fields generated by a long, cylindrical solenoid. We shall examine in some detail the concept of “effective mass” of a charged test particle. We shall show that, for a certain charge-to(rest)mass ratio of the test particle, the effective mass becomes imaginary at a certain distance from the axis of our solenoid.
In this paper we propose a set of generalized London equations which can describe the effects of gravitational waves on a superconducting antenna. We point out that a superconducting antenna with large quality factor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> will behave differently from a normal antenna, especially in the resonant case. The expression of the signal-to-noise ratio for a superconducting antenna is derived.
In this paper we investigate the effects of gravitational waves (GW) on a superconducting cylindrical antenna (S-antenna). We suggest that the electric fields induced by GW of dimensionless amplitude<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> ∼- 10<sup>−24</sup> in the interior of existing cylindrical antenna might be detectable.
In this paper we investigate the effect of gravitational waves (GW) on a superconductor. We find that the key properties of a superconductor, namely zero resistance and perfect diamagnetism, give rise to an important new effect, the presence of an induced electric field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E(r, t)</em> in the interior of the superconductor. The<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> field reacts with the ions and superelectrons. We argue, that not only is the finding of the coupled interactions of gravitation, electromagnetism and superconductivity inherently interesting, but that the induced<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> field might provide a significantly more sensitive means of detecting gravitational waves.
We develop spin matrices for a classical gravitational field in the linearized theory which satisfy angular-momentum commutation relations and are appropriate for a spin angular momentum of two. The same spin matrices come out of a decomposition of the angular momentum density of the linearized gravitational field into orbital and spin parts, similar to that carried out by Humblet for the electromagnetic field. To achieve this decomposition, we use the momentum density for the gravitational field obtained from the Landau-Lifshitz pseudo-tensor in the weak gravity limit. We note a formal connection between the spin angular momenta of gravitational and electromagnetic fields using the Kaluza-Klein idea.
We consider the boson (electromagnetic and gravitational) fields and the fermion (electron and neutrino) fields in the Plebanski-Demianski space-time.
Several methods of prescribing initial data for gravitational and matter fields, which are intended to eliminate extraneous radiation that is not produced by the matter source, are analysed in a simple exactly soluble radiating model. The model consists of an harmonic oscillator coupled to a scalar field along future light cones of Minkowski space time. In particular we analyze the asymptotic regime of the oscillator and find it is characterized essentially by two distinct decay modes. They differ in the way they behave both in the limit of small coupling constant and in a certain Newtonian limit. As a criterion to select initial data for the field with no extra radiation, we require that these initial data sets should put the oscillator from the start into the asymptotic regime. The underlying hypothesis here is that initial transients result from excitation of the oscillator by incoming radiation. We then see that the requirement of a uniform Newtonian limit leads to unique data for the scalar field for each arbitrary data set for the oscillator. We further find that this unique data set indeed satisfies our criterion.
Analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation in a homogeneous, Isotropic and spatially flat universe model, we find the conditions for the existence of a universe dominated by a scalar field in its early stages.
The paper is devoted to the presentation of a specific Lagrangian for the Poincaré gauge theory of gravity. Interesting and useful properties of the gauge theory of gravitation based on this Lagrangian are briefly outlined.

Some Bianchi-type string-cosmological models are presented here.
Gravitational Bags are spherically symmetric solutions of higher dimensional Kaluza-Klein (K-K) theories, where the compact dimensions become very large near the center of the geometry, although they are small elsewhere. K-K excitations become therefore very light when located near the center of this geometry and this appears to affect drastically the naive tower of masses spectrum of K-K theories. In the context of string theories, string excitations can be enclosed by Gravitational Bags, making them not only lighter, but also localized as observed by somebody who does not probe the central regions. Strings however can still have divergent sizes, as quantum mechanics seems to demand, since the extra dimensions blow up at the center of the geometry.
Theories in which gravity is coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field are known to have black hole solutions characterized by the value of the conserved axion charge. The Kalb-Ramond field configuration for these black holes has vanishing field strength. The axion charge may be measured by an analog of the Aharanov-Bohm interference effect. The axion-charge to mass ratio may be arbitrarily large, as contrasted to the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole where the electric-charge to mass ratio has an upper bound of one. The generic endpoint of semiclassical evaporation of an axionic black hole would therefore be an object of very large axion charge with mass of order the Planck mass. Axion charge also couples to Giddings-Strominger type instantons (wormholes) present in these theories. Instead of evaporating completely, therefore, it is likely that an axionic black hole will be swallowed by a wormhole, avoiding the appearance of a naked singularity. The loss of quantum coherence is a more subtle issue.
We describe an Eulerian, explicit computer code for the study of spherically-symmetric cosmological space-times on a Robertson-Walker background. The Einstein equations and the relativistic-hydrodynamic equations are written down for such a space-time using the “3+1” formalism of Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner [1]. Time slices are selected by the constant-mean-curvature criterion. Numerical techniques utilized in the code, as well as several code tests, are discussed, with emphasis on the difficulties encountered and their possible causes and cures.
In recent articles we have introduced Friedmann thermodynamics, where certain geometric parameters in Friedmann models were treated like their thermodynamic counterparts (temperature, entropy, Gibbs potential, etc.). This model has the advantage of allowing us to determine the geometry of the universe by thermodynamic stability arguments. In this paper, in search for evidence for the definition of “gravitational” temperature, we will investigate a massless conformal scalar field in an Einstein universe in detail. We will argue that the “gravitational” temperature of the Einstein universe is given as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub>g</sub>=1/2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>) (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħc/k</em>) (1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>0</sub>), where R<sub>0</sub> is the radius of the Einstein universe. This is in accord with our definition of “gravitational” temperature in Friedmann thermodynamics and determines the dimensionless constant as 1/2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>. We discuss the limitations of the model we are using. We also suggest a method to generalize our “gravitational” temperature to arbitrary space-times granted that they are sufficiently smooth.
We discuss the calculation of the three-loop<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em>-function for the twodimensional non-linear<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>-model with torsion. It satisfies an integrability condition which leads to the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>′)<sup>1,2</sup>-corrections (to Einstein gravity) generated from the theory of closed bosonic strings at the tree level. Some applications of these results are briefly discussed.
A geometrical discussion of special conformal vector fields in space-time is given. In particular, it is shown that if such a vector field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em> is admitted, it is unique up to a constant scaling and the addition of a homothetic or a Killing vector field. In the case when the gradient of the conformal scalar associated with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em> is non-null it is shown that other homothetic and affine symmetries are necessarily admitted by the space-time, that an intrinsic family of 2-dimensional flat submanifolds is determined in the space-time, that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em> is, in general, hypersurface orthogonal and that the space-time, if non-flat, is necessarily (geodesically) incomplete. Other geometrical features of such space-times are also considered.
Some new effective actions are suggested for theories in which the affine connection is not completely specified by the metric. The new actions lead to models in which the metric, torsion, and Weyl vector fields all propagate. The dimensionally reduced versions do not contain third derivatives of the gauge potentials in the field equation. Some simple models which exhibit simultaneous breaking of Weyl and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Lorentz symmetry are investigated. It is shown that it is possible for this effect to occur in any model in which the field action contains the Einstein-Hilbert term. This is due to the fact that the contortion occurs in this object as part of an indefinite quadratic form.


Fluid space-times which admit a conformal Killing vector (CKV) are studied. It is shown that even in a perfect fluid space-time a conformal motion will not, in general, map the fluid flow lines onto fluid flow lines; consequently, perfect fluid space-times and, in particular, the simplest perfect fluid space-times known to admit a CKV, namely the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-times, are studied. A direct proof that there do not exist any special CKV in FRW space-times will be given, thereby motivating the study of the physically more relevant proper CKV. Indeed, one of the principal motivations of the present work is the study of the symmetry inheritance problem for proper CKV. Since the FRW metric can, in general, satisfy the Einstein field equations for a non-comoving imperfect fluid, the relationship between the FRW models (and in particular the standard comoving perfect fluid models) and the conditions under which conformal motions (and in addition homothetic motions) map fluid flow lines onto fluid flow lines are investigated. Finally, further properties of fluid space-times which admit a proper CKV, and in particular space-times in which the CKV is parallel to the fluid four-velocity, are discussed.
Black holes can have non-classical hair, i.e. they can be characterized by observable quantum numbers associated with discrete charges which are not coupled to long range propagating gauge fields. This blurs the apparent distinction between small black holes and elementary particles, as well has having important implications for wormhole physics.
A new, unified basis for the study of gravitational effects in quantum and classical systems described by linear wave equations has been obtained by means of a covariant generalization of Berry's phase. The new formulation reveals aspects of the interaction of particles with weak gravitational fields hitherto thought to apply only to the stationary, nonrelativistic case. Though the emerging gauge structure is that of general relativity, weak gravitational fields behave as non-local vector fields. Their action on wave functions amounts, in first order, to a phase factor. Some effects predicted in the literature are re-calculated and extended to the fully relativistic regime. New effects are also predicted. The new approach affords a more precise description and a better understanding of particle interferometry as a tool to study gravitation.
The vacuum field equations of the quadratic Poincaré gauge field theory are expressed in the spin coefficient formalism of Newman and Penrose. These are differential identities involving curvature and torsion and, for an NP-type approach, must be combined with the NP-identities in a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub> given by Jogia and Griffiths (1980). The use of the formalism is demonstrated in the derivation of some new exact solutions.
We present a locally conformal invariant cosmology based on the Weyl tensor rather than the Einstein one. The cosmology admits of a de Sitter solution with no cosmological constant.
A formulation of the ECSK (Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble) theory with a Dirac spinor is given in terms of differential forms with values in exterior vector bundles associated with a fixed principal<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2, ℂ)-bundle over a 4-manifold. In particular, tetrad fields are represented as soldering forms. In this setting, both the scalar curvature (Einstein-Hilbert) action density and the Dirac action density are well-defined polynomial functions of the soldering form and an independent<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2,ℂ)-connection form. Thus, these densities are defined even where the tetrad field is degenerate (e.g. when fluctuations in the gravitational field are large). A careful analysis of the initial-value problem (in terms of an evolving triad field, SU(2)-connection, second-fundamental form and spinor field) reveals a first-order hyperbolic system of 27 evolution equations (not including the 8 evolution equations for the Dirac spinor) and 16 constraints. There are 10 conservation equations (due to local Poincaré invariance) which team up with some of the evolution equations to guarantee that the 16 constraints are preserved under the evolution.
In this paper we investigate the chaotic behaviour of the Bianchi IX cosmological models using techniques developed in the study of dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. We numerically calculate the Lyapunov exponent, λ, and show that instead of converging to a constant value, it decreases steadily. We study this effect further by studying the Lyapunov exponent using short-time averages. We show that the usual method of calculating λ is invalid in the case of a cosmological model.
An asympototically flat algebraically general vacuum metric is obtained. The solution is characterized by two commuting spacelike Killing vectors with flat integral surfaces and depends on one arbitrary function.
It is shown that Komar's conserved quantities can be generalized to space-times with a cosmological constant in which matter, electric charge, and massless scalar field are sources. In the special case of the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter solution, treated as a solution external to matter sources, these quantities are equal to the global mass and angular momentum of its source. They are determined regardless of any local distribution of the mass and angular momentum of sources in addition to the electric charge given by the classical Gauss' law.
A well-known solution, for a flat model in general relativity obeying the Robertson-Walker metric, a perfect fluid energy-tensor and a perfect gas law of state, with constant deceleration parameter, is now shown to yield growing scalar density perturbations, provided that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> &gt; 0.
The conditions for a space-time to admit a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector field are studied. Tests are derived first for space-times that admit two commuting Killing vectors, both for the timelike-spacelike (TS) case and the spacelike-spacelike case (SS); these give the condition for linear combinations of the two known Killing vectors to be hypersurface orthogonal. Illustrations are given in some stationary axisymmetric (TS) metrics and cylindrically symmetric (SS) metrics. In the general case, conditions for static symmetry are already known. We give the similar conditions for a spacelike hypersurface-orthogonal Killing field.
In several previous papers the author proposed to consider Cartan's contortion as a gauge field of Lorentz-group mediated by a massless spin-2 fields twin. In this article it is shown that these fields may be accompanied by a further pair of massive or massless spin-0 fields. Unfortunately, the study of the interaction of contortion with a Proca field shows that there is no reasonable macroscopic source generating the contortion. This defect is essential; the contortion mediated by standard fields can hardly exist in nature.
The field equations of general relativity are solved to post-Newtonian order for a frame of reference having an arbitrary time-dependent, translational acceleration and an arbitrary time-dependent angular velocity. The derivation is based on a new 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein field equations and geodesic equation of motion. The resulting space-time metric and equation of motion contain gravitational terms, inertial terms, and coupled gravitational-inertial terms. These effects are expressed explicitly in terms of the Newtonian potential and standard post-Newtonian scalar and vector potentials. The physical meaning of the formulas derived is illustrated by application to a system of “point-like” gravitating masses. These results should be useful for the investigation of general relativistic effects in the analysis of real experimental measurements made with respect to a noninertial frame of reference, such as the surface of the rotating earth or an accelerated spacecraft.
Following the example of electromagnetism, a torsion potential is introduced. By considering variations with respect to the metric tensor and the torsion potential, a theory of gravitation with propagating torsion is obtained. Sources are introduced and the equation of motion is obtained.
This paper investigates space-times which admit an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-dimensional Lie algebra of homothetic vector fields at least one of which is proer homothetic. The situation is resolved completely if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> ≥ 6 and some general results are given when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> ≤ 5. Some applications to the study of affine vector fields in space-times are also given and the maximum dimension of this latter algebra is computed and corrects an earlier error.
We consider the Abelian Higgs model with a Chern-Simons term coupled to the Einstein theory of gravitation in 3-dimensional space-time. We seek a finite solution, regular everywhere, having a stationary, cylindrically symmetric metric. We analyze these field equations and we suggest that such a solution exists. We find that the asymptotic metric of this solution corresponds to that which describes gravitationally a massive particle with spin. We obtain explicitly the expression of the spin. We give only the expression of the mass in the first order with respect to the gravitational coupling constant.
An invariant correlation and a variational principle are given for the theory of connections and frames introduced in previous papers. The relation of the resultant gravitation theory to Yang's theory is clarified. The resultant equations of motion, which imply a generalized Dirac equation, are used to understand geometrically certain aspects of relativistic quantum theory. The conjecture is proposed that electrornegnetism is related to an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) subgroup. The possible association of the extra generators with strong and weak nuclear forces is discussed.
A simple quantum viewpoint of gravitational radiation is given. The starting point is the definition of the amplitude that a given source distribution of matter emits a graviton of goven momentum and helicity. From the corresponding probability distribution of the number of gravitons of a given energy, the classic slow motion expression for the power loss follows in a simple and lucid manner. Special attention is also given to the gauge terms in the analysis.
An orthogonal form of the Schwarzschild metric is given and the transformation relating this form to the standard one is found.
We formulate a space-time translation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub>4</sub> gauge theory of gravity on the Minkowski space-time with appropriate choice of the Lagrangian. By comparing the energy-momentum law of this theory with that of new general relativity constructed on the Weitzenböck space-time we find that in the classical limit the gauge potentials correspond to the parallel vector fields in the Weitzenböck space-time and the gauge field equation coincides with the field equation of gravity in new general relativity in the linearized version. Thus we conclude that in the classical limit the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub>4</sub> gauge theory of gravity leads to the new general relativity.
Orthonormal frames adapted to normal coordinate systems are considered. A formalism is developed which can be used to compute the components of connections and curvature tensors relative to such frames. An application to four-metrics with half-flat curvature is presented.
The physical properties of a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid metric proposed by Buchdahl are investigated. The general solution can be written in terms of associated Legendre functions. If the adiabatic sound speed is to be less than the velocity of light at the boundary of the sphere, its radius will be larger than 1.238 times the Schwarzschild radius. Two particular solutions are studied in detail.
A static solution of Einstein's equations representing perfect fluid cylinders of finite radius is presented. The density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> and pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> are finite and monotonic decreasing from the axis to the boundary. The ratio<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p/μ</em> (&lt; 1) also decreases steadily. The regularity condition at the axis is satisfied and the solution is free of singularity. The equation of state is found and special cases considered. It is shown that the solution can be joined to the vacuum cylindrical metric at the boundary. There is then at least one free parameter left in the family of solutions.
We study the locally conformal invariant Weyl theory of gravitation and introduce a conformally coupled scalar field. Einstein gravity is induced by spontaneous breaking of the local conformal symmetry in an effective long range approximation. The effective potential for the scalar field is calculated at the one-loop level up to curvature squared in order in an arbitrary curved background. The non-zero vacuum expectation value of the scalar field induces the dimensional Einstein's gravitational coupling constant stably in case of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> &gt; 0. For<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> &lt; 0, the phase transition occurs from the symmetric phase to the broken phase as the curvature decreases. This theory may be an attractive candidate for the primordial inflationary universe scenario.
We study collision-free gases in Bianchi space-times. Spatially homogeneous distribution functions are found for all Bianchi types by supposing that the distribution function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, p) is a function of the Killing vector constants of the motion only. Bianchi types I, VIII and IX only, lead to physical distributions. In types VIII and IX the average behaviour of the gas is that of a nonrotating viscous fluid. In an attempt to obtain physical spatially homogeneous distribution functions for all Bianchi types, we write the Liouville equation in a spatially homogeneous orthonormal tetrad. Furthermore, the general inhomogeneous solution of Liouville's equation in Bianchi type I is obtained, depending on constants of the motion that generalise the conserved quantities generated by Lorentz boosts in flat space-time.
In this paper we introduce gravitomagnetic field equations into the investigation of gravitomagnetic effects on a superconductor. We point out that in the absence of an applied magnetic field, an applied gravitomagnetic field will induce twin currents, gravitational and electric supercurrents. The latter will create a magnetic field. The slightly modified Josephson, London, and London-type gravitomagnetic equations are obtained. Some applications of these equations are discussed.
We announce and justify two theorems (proofs will appear in Refs. 1 and 2): i) A generalization of the singularity theorem of Hawking and Penrose [3] to space-times with chronology violations. Although it is impossible to remove the chronology condition completely the announced theorem is in a well defined sense optimal: the chronology condition is replaced by a strictly weaker condition that cannot be removed because of counter examples, ii) If the chronology violating set<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> has compact closure and the strong energy and generic conditions hold, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> is generated by incomplete null geodesics. It follows that if the region of causality violation does not extend to infinity then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> contains singularities.
When Brans and Dicke published their alternative gravitational framework, they proved that it led to Machian solutions in the static case, and for a pressureless (dust) Euclidean universe. We extend their demonstration to Euclidean and non-Euclidean models with non-null pressure, employing the perfect fluid model. We find<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> both ∝<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>.
A simple differential equation which shares some properties of the Einstein equations is constructed, and a few aspects of its behavior are investigated. Of primary interest are results which suggest the possibility of chaos in the vacuum Einstein theory, and the possibility that complex shock-like features may develop from smooth initial data. A means of migrating the results to the full theory is outlined, and preliminary evidence is provided that the full theory does indeed possess properties suggested by the toy model.
A cosmological model in which the universe has its critical density and the gravitational and cosmological “constants”<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and Λ are time-dependent is presented. The model may possibly solve the horizon and monopole problems. It predicts a perpetually expanding universe in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> increases and Λ decreases with time in a manner consistent with conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. The model also allows the calculation of various cosmological parameters.
A possible physical justification of the Weyl gauge procedure is proposed. It is argued that in the case of a general affine connection geodesic parameters have a nontrivial functional relation to metric interval. Since geodesic parameters can also define a notion of interval (via Schild's ladder), we appear to have an inconsistency at the very foundation of any theory which incorporates a nonmetric-compatible connection. This inconsistency can be removed by postulating the Weyl transformations as a valid symmetry of nature, at least at the appropriate energy scale. The method would appear to work even in theories containing shear, provided that it too acquires a mass as a result of (or prior to) the breaking of Weyl symmetry.
It is shown how the use of coordinates where time is measured with clocks moving radially in a spherically symmetric gravitational field leads to general relativistic dynamical expressions that are exactly identical to corresponding expressions in Newtonian theory. The general formalism is developed for the case where the stress-energy tensor is that of a perfect fluid. Expressions like the Newtonian inverse square gravitational law, the Newtonian equation of continuity for fluid flow, Newtonian conservation of energy, etc., follow quite naturally from the fully-fledged exact general relativistic equations. Specific examples involving cosmology and gravitational collapse are given.
We investigate the geodesic curves of the homogeneous Gödel-type space-times, which constitute a two-parameter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> and Ω) class of solutions presented to several theories of gravitation (general relativity, Einstein-Cartan and higher derivative). To this end, we first examine the qualitative properties of those curves by means of the introduction of an effective potential and then accomplish the analytical integration of the equations of motion. We show that some of the qualitative features of the free motion in GSdel's universe (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>=2Ω<sup>2</sup>) are preserved in all space-times, namely: (a) the projections of the geodesics onto the 2-surface (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r, φ</em>) are simple closed curves (with some exceptions for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>≥4Ω<sup>2</sup>), and (b) the geodesies for which the ratio of azimuthal angular momentum to total energy,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>, is equal to zero always cross the origin<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0. However, two new cases appear: (i) radially unbounded geodesies with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> assuming any (real) value, which may occur only for the causal space-times (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>≥4Ω<sup>2</sup>), and (ii) geodesies with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> bounded both below and above, which always occur for the circular family (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em><sup>2</sup>&lt;0) of space-times.
A 5D Kaluza-Klein type extension of General Relativity with variable rest mass was proposed by Wesson [9]. This theory has been worked on by several people, including Grøn and Soleng [24]. Comments are made to clarify the status of this theory, and the objections of Grøn and Soleng in particular are countered. Suggestions for further work are made.
Recently, an analytical stellar model with a stiff equation of state and density distribution<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ=ρ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub>(1-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>2</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>o</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>) was presented. We show that such a solution cannot exist.

Space-times conformal to physical space-time are considered, assuming the nongravitational energy is conservative after the conformal transformation. Necessary and sufficient conditions satisfied by the conformal factor axe found for a given type of transformation of the energy tensor. The weak gravitational field is defined and the coordinate conditions for the existence of conformal factors in such a field are obtained.
Tohnan's V solution has found wide application to the redshift problem in astrophysics but it has a drawback in that there is singularity at the centre. We have developed a core-envelope model with a parabolic density distribution in the core and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sup> ∝<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>2n</sup> in the envelope. The most distinctive feature of the model is that there is a continuity of all the four variables (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E, P</em>, λ and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>) at the boundary. In other analytic coreenvelope models the continuity of only three variables is possible. This two-density structure has been used to model neutron stars and their mass, size and red shifts have been obtained.
We demonstrate the implementation of a computer algebra system to perform calculations in a variable frame formalism in general relativity in SHEEP. We present the results of the application of such a program to the velocity dominated approximations to solutions near space-like singularities.
If the Newton-Cartan theory of gravitation is not restricted by a “law of existence of absolute rotation”, its statements for infinite systems may differ from those of Newton's classical theory through the existence of intrinsic (gravitational) Coriolis fields. Explicit examples are given.
A study of matter-radiation universes under certain supplementary conditions specified in the introduction shows us that the only model of this class compatible with observations is a parabolic universe which at the present time is almost the same as an Einstein-de Sitter model. The numerical values obtained for Hubble's constant, the age of the universe and the matter density at the present time are quite acceptable. We can also obtain some limits for the mass of neutrinos. The advantage of this parabolic model is that it gives the same results as the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>2/3</sup> model at the present time and what is more could be used in studying problems of the formation of galaxies, after the recombination epoch, where matter and radiation have comparable importance.
We present an exact solution of the n-dimensional (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &gt; 4) vacuum Einstein field equations with a Bianchi type I metric. The solution may be interpreted as a four-dimensional anisotropic cosmological model. The extra dimensions are related to the energy density and pressures in the model. The physics of the results is discussed at the end of the paper.
New exact solutions of the algebraic form for the static Einstein-Maxwell equations representing the exterior gravitational field of a massive magnetic dipole are derived. They are then used for construction of the stationary electrovacuum solutions reducing to the Schwarzschild metric in a pure vacuum limit.
A study of intrinsic properties of proper Lorentz tensors (tensor fields defining proper Lorentz transformations at every point of space-time) is made, giving rise to their covariant decompositions. The exponential series for a generic 2-form is covariantly summed, and the resulting proper Lorentz tensor is expressed as a linear combination of the metric tensor, the 2-form, its dual and its energy tensor. Some covariant expressions for the 2-form corresponding to the logarithmic branches of a proper Lorentz tensor are given. Some properties of the Lorentz group are easily found, concerning the surjectivity, local injectivity and local inversibility of the exponential map.
It is shown that the spatial geometry of the bubbles with a constant radial coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sub>o</sub>, embedded in the Kerr-Newman manifold, does not depend on the mass and charge of this solution when referred to a coordinate frame rigidly rotating with the angular velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(r<span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>2+a</sup> </span><sup>2</sup>)<sup>−1</sup>. The corresponding line element is found to be identical to the one obtained by Smarr for the surface geometry of a charged rotating black hole.


The linearized Einstein field equations with Einstein space-times as background are studied by use of the harmonic gauge. By means of Riesz' integration method a representation theorem for the solution of Cauchy's problem, using the constraints of the Cauchy data and the calculus of symmetric differential forms, is proved. We introduce some linear differential operators, which map the set of symmetric differential forms into the subset with vanishing divergence and trace and use these operators to derive necessary conditions for the validity of Huygens' principle from which it follows that the linearized field equations satisfy Huygens' principle only in flat space-times.
Deviations from the equivalence principle can be found by observations of the orbital periods of masses in a two body system, in a drag free satellite in geosynchronous orbit. At this altitude the Earth gravitational field tides allow close stable circular motion, within a 30 cm lobe, of a small test mass around the centre of the primary mass, of 75 kg. The repulsive fifth force ought to slow the orbital Newtonian period. A precise clock and laser interferometry provide the determination of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> in the range between 1 and 10<sup>2</sup>cm and of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> if larger than 10<sup>−4.2</sup> or 10<sup>−5</sup>, for an uncertainty of the value of the constant of gravitation equal to 10<sup>−5</sup> or 10<sup>−6</sup>, respectively (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> are the coupling coefficient to gravity and range of action of the fifth force). In the latter case, for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> around 10 cm, the fifth force may be detected for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> larger than 10<sup>−5.5</sup>. This experiment may verify the principle of equivalence at short range improving the actual limits from one to two and a half orders of magnitude. The range of action,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em>, up to several meters can be observed with this “local” experimental concept, but only for large values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>, which have been excluded recently by ground experiments.
An exact solution of Einstein gravity coupled to a dilaton field is found. The solution is conformally flat and is invariant under Lorentz transformations. The singularities and conformal structure of the metric are examined.
A nonminimal and nongauge invariant descirption of nonlinear electrodynamics in space-times with torsion is given. It is shown that in the case of the Weitzenböck teleparallel space-time, massive photons are produced by a mechanism which involves the nonminimal coupling constant and the divergence of the torsion vector.
We consider the Beltrami parametrization of a 2-dimensional metric and work out the basic transformation laws of the constituting fields. These results are then applied to investigate the geometric structure of 2-dimensional gravity in Polyakov's light-cone gauge. Subsequently, we elaborate on the supersymmetric generalization of this theory. The general relation to the superconformai gauge is presented in detail and the corresponding change of coordinates is shown to satisfy simple super Beltrami equations.
The concept of extended elementary particles proposed by the author in previous papers is briefly outlined in a slightly modified form. In this framework special Einstein-Maxwell null fields are interpreted as extended massless particles with helicity. A model of extended photons is proposed.
A method for constructing solutions for a relativistic static “gaseous” sphere is examined. “Gaseous” here means that the density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> vanishes at the outer boundary together with the pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>. Two different classes of solutions are investigated in detail. The models of both these classes have the property that the density gradient is zero both at the center and at the surface. It is further shown that both classes yield models which are physically acceptable, i.e. both the pressure and the density are positive and finite inside the outer boundary of the sphere, and their respective gradients are negative. The trace of their energy-momentum tensors are positive, and the adiabatic sound speeds are decreasing outwards throughout the sphere. The relativistic adiabatic indices are examined, and it is found that they are decreasing functions of radial coordinate. It is shown that for the first class this index is 3/2 at the surface, while for the second class it is 4/3 at the boundary. We find that the models of the first class are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">stable</em> with respect to small radial disturbances. Putting the density at the center equal to 10<sup>16</sup>g cm<sup>−3</sup>, the maximum mass for the stable class is found to be 0.87 solar masses.
A class of algebraically special exact solutions of the vacuum quadratic Poincaré gauge field theory is presented. These solutions are of type III and type N and have a nonexpanding, shear-free and twist-free geodesic repeated principal null congruence. The metric is of Kundt's class, and the torsion components are solutions of certain differential equations. The solutions have been obtained using a generalised spin coefficient formalism.



A class of covariant first-order Lagrangians for General Relativity interacting with external matter fields is considered. These Lagrangians depend on the choice of a background connection which has no dynamics. The Poincaré-Cartan form, energy density flows and energy-momentum tensors are derived for this class of Lagrangians by applying standard methods, and the results are compared with those appearing in current literature. We obtain new results concerning superpotentials and covariant conservation laws. As an example, these are applied to calculate the mass and angular momentum for the Schwarzschild and Kerr black-holes.
We study in the framework of the Optical Reference Geometry the manner in which the coupling of the angular momentum of a test particle with that of a Kerr black hole affects the ‘Newtonian’ forces acting on the particle.
The Kundt class of algebraically special solutions of Einstein's field equations, representing vacuum and electromagnetic null fields with one twisting, non-null Killing vector, is discussed. This generalizes the case with a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector field which is discussed by Kramer and Neugebauer [3]. The solutions are shown to be equivalent to the Hoenselaers (vacuum) and Hoenselaers-Skea (electromagnetic null) solutions, once some small corrections and the relevant coordinate transformations are made to the latter solutions.
Exact solutions representing mixed plane-gravitational waves and planewaves of scalar fields and non-Abelian gauge fields in higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories are obtained under the generalized higher-dimensional harmonic condition. Two special cases are discussed.
We study the properties of the solution space of local surface-forming null “sub-congruences” in the neighbourhood of a given null geodesic in a pseudo-Riemannian space-time. This solution space is a three-dimensional manifold, naturally endowed with a conformai Minkowski metric.
The paper contains the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given energy tensor to be interpreted as a sum of two perfect fluids. Given a tensor of this class, the decomposition in two perfect fluids (which is determined up to a couple of real functions) is obtained.
A solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations representing a massive magnetic dipole is investigated. Problems of its physical interpretation are discussed and test particle motion is studied.
The study of nonsingular cosmological models [4] based on a theory of gravitation in flat space-times [1] is continued. For a radiation free universe the solution of the model is given analytically. Under the assumption that entropy cannot decrease the cosmological constant must be zero. At the beginning of the universe all energy is in the form of gravitation. The universe contracts. Matter and radiation are created out of gravitational energy and entropy is produced. The contraction stops and then the universe expands without limit. The creation of matter continues producing entropy but today the production of matter and entropy is negligible. The density parameter Ω<sub>0</sub> ≈ 1, i.e. there must be “missing mass” in the universe. The “flatness” and the “homogeneity” problem are solved.
If an axially symmetric stationary metric is given in standard form (i.e. in coordinates adapted to the symmetries) the transformation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>→<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>′ =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ-ωt</em> (ω=constant) of the azimuthal angle leads to another such standard form. The spatial lattice<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L′</em> corresponding to the latter rotates at angular velocity<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> relative to the lattice<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> of the former. For the standard form of a stationary metric there are simple formulae giving the four-acceleration of a given lattice point and the rotation of a gyroscope at a given lattice point. Applying these formulae to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L′</em>, we find the condition for circular paths about the axis in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> to be 4-geodesic, and also the precession of gyroscopes along circular paths which are not necessarily geodesic. Among other examples we re-obtain the complete geodesic structure of the Gödel universe, and the gyroscopic precessions associated with the names of Thomas, Fokker and de Sitter, and Schiff.

It is shown that the procedure introduced by Wald for constructing solutions of a coupled system of linear partial differential equations from the solution of a single equation, based on the concept of the adjoint of a linear partial differential operator, can be extended to equations involving spinor fields, matrix fields and two or more fields. Some results concerning massless spinor fields are presented and the application of the method to linear perturbations of Yang-Mills fields and of Einstein-Maxwell fields is indicated.
A two-parameter family of solutions of Einstein's equations, corresponding to distribution valued stress-energy tensors with support on a (pair of intersecting) null hypersurface(s), is presented. They describe the collision of infinitely thin shells of null dust colliding with shells of the same kind and/or gravitational plane waves. For a subclass of this new family of solutions, the typical spacelike singularity that develops after the collision and forms the future boundary of the interaction region gives its place to a nonsingular Killing-Cauchy horizon.
An exact solution of Einstein's equations describing the gravitational wave associated to a ring of massless particles is presented. It has been obtained by boosting the Kerr metric along the axis of symmetry, and considering the limit in which the speed of the boost tends to the velocity of light.
The Kaluza-Klein wormhole soliton metric is a regular localized solution with Minkowskian signature, to the sourceless five-dimensional Einstein equations. We apply five-to-three dimensional reduction to convert the problem of geodesic motion of neutral or charged test particles in this metric to a non-relativistic potential problem, which we discuss in detail, studying bound and scattering states. We show that there is no observable difference between scattering of a spinless test particle by a point charge and by a wormhole soliton.
Space-times admitting special conformai Killing vectors are studied, and some results, already existing in the literature are reviewed from a different point of view. A classification scheme for those space-times whose associated conformai factor has a non-null gradient is presented in terms of their group of isometries, giving in each case the explicit expression of their metric tensor.
In a simple two-body system, we calculate the gravitomagnetic components of the metric in the local quasi-inertial frame of one of the bodies. The local geometry in this frame which is freely falling along the geodesic but is directionally fixed with respect to distant stars is primarily denned by the gravitomagnetic components of the local metric. This metric serves to track down the various contributions from the local and distant source and thus provides further insight to the nature of gravitomagnetism. As a result we show that in the quasi-inertial frame geodetic precession is a gravitomagnetic phenomenon. Furthermore we establish a connection between local gravitomagnetic effects and Einstein's principle of equivalence.
The axisymmetric rigidly rotating or static perfect fluid solutions admitting a proper conformai Killing vector orthogonal to the orbits of the two-dimensional group of motions are determined.
It is shown that if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is a subgroup of the group of motions of a given space-time then a tetrad can be chosen which is symmetric under the subgroup if and only if the rank of the generators of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is equal to the order of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>. As an example such a tetrad is constructed for the Type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> twisting empty space-time admitting a two-parameter group of motions.
We investigate the geometry of the Kerr space-time near the ring singularity. A systematic study of the mathematical and physical structure of this region reveals that the singularity in the Kerr space-time is naturally understood in terms of a subset of the immersion of the set defined by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0 (in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates) in the Kerr space-time. It is well known that the Kerr space-time is not a differentiable manifold (due to the curvature singularity) or a topological manifold, but a well defined topological space with a structure that is manifested by the constrast in taking limits along the hypersurface at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0 and the equatorial plane which approach singularity. We find that the ring singularity is either an edge or a self-intersection of the topological space depending on which extension of the metric through<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>=0 is implemented. A major result of this analysis is the extrapolation to the general accelerating case of Carter's proof that the only nonspacelike geodesics which can reach the ring singularity are restricted to the equatorial plane. For finite magnitudes of proper acceleration, it is shown that only lightlike trajectories that asymptotically approach the null generator of the ring singularity can reach it from above or below the equatorial plane.
A complete formulation of kinetic theory in the scale-covariant gravitation is presented in this paper. Following the usual scheme we find the Boltzmann equation for a colliding gas. From this equation we obtain the H-Theorem and the equilibrium distribution functions for homogeneous and isotropic spaces in the quantum case and in the high dilution limit.
We propose to call a dynamical dimensional reduction effective if the corresponding dynamical system possesses a single attracting critical point representing expanding physical space-time and static internal space. We show that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BV × T</em><sup>D</sup> multidimensional cosmological model with a hydrodynamic energy-momentum tensor provides an example of effective dimensional reduction. We also study the dynamics of the multidimensional cosmological model of type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BI × T</em><sup>D</sup> with an energy-momentum tensor representing low temperature quantum effects, monopole contribution and the cosmological constant. It turns out that anisotropy and the cosmological constant are crucial for the process of dimensional reduction to be effective. We argue that this is the general property of homogeneous multidimensional cosmological models.
By including the cosmological term in the minimum quadratic (Poincaré) gauge theory of gravity, the basic equation set for the homogeneous anisotropic Bianchi type I spinning-fluid models are obtained. For the linear equation of state, using methods of qualitative theory of dynamical systems, we make the complete qualitative analysis of properties of every possible solution of these equations, In particular, some solutions with regular behaviour of the metric and torsion are found.
The approach to symmetries given by Kerr and Debney (1970) is applied to the class of vacuum Robinson-Trautman solutions. The coordinate freedom is extended and used to define the pull-backs of local diffeomorphisms which are then shown to be homothetic motions. The resulting homothetic Killing's equations are solved to give a form of all homothety groups for this class.
The two possible definitions, proposed in Parts II and III, of a space-time symmetry in supergravity, arising respectively from an analysis in four-dimensional space-time and from superspace considerations, are shown to be inequivalent, although closely related to one another. It is argued that the former must be preferred to the latter for physical reasons.
A class of ten-dimensional anisotropic cosmologies, with three independent spatial scale factors, is explored. Extensions of the Bianchi types I and IX space-times are analysed, in both the case of the field equations of General Relativity and the case of generalized equations of relativity altered by low-energy superstring correction terms.
It is shown how the energy-positivity criterion enables us to localize the energy in various field theories. For this purpose the role of surface integrals in a canonical formalism is investigated. The same techniques are applied to linearized gravity, where the mixed Cauchy-boundary value problem in a finite volume is analyzed. Unconstrained degrees of freedom and boundary data which have to be controlled are found. This paper is part of a program to analyze the possibility of localization of gravitational energy in complete General Relativity.
We discuss the generalization of the Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity to an (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N + M</em>)-dimensional quasi-Riemannian theory with tangent space group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(1,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>−1)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO(M)</em>. We find some regular blackhole solutions whose horizon has a topology<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SN</em>−2×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>M</sup>, but which are not asymptotically flat.
A model of a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic, vacuum universe with geometry<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup> is studied using a hamiltonian formalism. The formalism is developed by first deriving the hamiltonian for a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional, mixmaster-type, vacuum universe. The model evolves from an initial Kasner-like state to a final Kasner-like state upon irreversible collapse. The collapse is predicted to be inevitable based on qualitative analysis and numerical calculations verify this behavior. A lower bound of 0.286 is found for the ratio of the contraction rate of the universe long after a Kasner phase transition to the contraction rate long before the transition. Seven of the seventeen theoretically possible qualitatively different compactification schemes are found numerically and tabulated. A subset of all the constraint satisfying initial conditions which leads to three isotropically expanding dimensions and six contracting dimensions is found.


A new class of vacuum solutions in the new five-dimensional space-timemass gravity theory is found. These new cosmological models describe expanding universes without a big bang singularity, and the fifth dimension of these models shrinks as they expand.
We analytically investigate gravitational radiation induced by a test particle falling into an extreme Kerr black hole. Assuming the radiation is dominated by the infinite sequence of quasi-normal modes which has the limiting frequency<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>/(2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>), where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> is an azimuthal eigenvalue and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the mass of the black hole. we find the radiated energy diverges logarithmically in time. Then we evaluate the back reaction to the black hole by appealing to the energy and angular momentum conservation laws. We find the radiation has a tendency to increase the ratio of the angular momentum to mass of the black hole, which is completely different from the non-extreme case, while the contribution of the test particle is to decrease it.
In a space of FRLW models, filled with a single fluid such that its energy-momentum tensor satisfies standard energy conditions and the dynamics of the universe is described by a second order differential equation,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the existence of particle horizons is a generic property</em>. To remove particle horizons one must invest nearly as much as to remove them together with the initial singularity.
Gerlach and Sengupta derived a master equation for arbitrary odd-parity gravitational perturbations of spherically symmetrical space-times. In this paper we show that for radiative purely gravitational perturbations of Robertson-Walker space-times the same equation governs the evenparity perturbations as well.
In a series of papers Janis and coworkers found a family of Robertson-Walker space-times whose most general radiative purely gravitational perturbations could be expressed as progressing waves. In this paper we significantly generalize, simplify, and extend, their results.
We consider a modified Robertson-Walker (R-W) cosmological model with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>= +1 which tends towards the R-W model in future. The model has expansion, shear and rotation and is filled with matter together with radiation. Shear and rotation are shown to decrease with time. The evolutions of pressure, matter density and radiation density are studied. This model may approximately represent the actual situation in our universe which may have had some rotation in the past and was dominated by radiation. The only unsatisfactory feature of this model is that the pressure does not remain positive throughout.
We show how the Sparling form can be expressed in the spin-coefficient formalism. In particular, using an earlier result we obtain an expression for the energy-momentum pseudotensor in terms of spin-coefficients.
The Kasner metric is one of the more widely studied metrics. Its usefulness for the construction of cosmological models and its utility for certain studies of elementary particles has made it particularly attractive for exploitation. Because of its simplicity it has been “rediscovered” many times and is itself very closely related to metrics given several years earlier by Weyl, Levi-Civita, and Wilson. The form in which Kasner presented it has been virtually forgotten in favor of the dynamic form of the synchronous Bianchi I metric. Kasner metrics may be either static or dynamic. To each static metric there is a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cognate</em> dynamic metric and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">vice versa</em>, and the two are related by a complex coordinate transformation. The characterization of a Kasner metric is by means of a set of parameters. It is possible for these to take on complex values with interesting consequences, In the discussion a curious error in the original paper is rectified and some “new” Kasner metrics are presented. The discussion throughout is confined to the vacuum metric.
Gravitational lenses could be used to detect gravitational waves, because a gravitational wave affects the travel-time of a light ray. In a gravitational lens, this effect produces time-delays between the different images. Thus the bending of light, which was the first experimental confirmation of Einstein's theory, can be used to search for gravitational waves, which are the most poorly confirmed aspect of that same theory. Applying this method to the gravitational lens 0957+561 gives new upper bounds on the amplitude of low-frequency gravitational waves in the universe, and new limits on the energy-density during an early “inflationary” phase.

Extended” and “hyperextended” inflationary models of the universe have been developed which avoid the extreme fine-tuning required by all previous approaches. The models also generate a new source of inhomogeneities that affect large-scale structure. The most surprising feature is the role that inflation can play in altering the nature of the gravitational force.
Domains larger than the horizon in which Φ &gt; (a few) ×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>pl</sub> are required for the onset of inflation. Two different, equally plausible, arguments lead us to opposite conclusions about the feasibility of the existence of such regions. It seems that inflation does not free us completely from the need for special initial conditions. However, Linde has pointed out that inflation can be eternal. He stresses the fact that inflation will never cease, but this also means that it did not necessarily have a beginning. We argue that this is the simplest solution to the initial value problem and that inflation might not only solve the problems of the Big Bang model, it might also provide us with an alternative that will replace it altogether.
In the linearized theory of topologically massive gravitation, we consider the spacetime describing a stationary, cylindrically symmetric source. We calculate the asymptotic form of the corresponding metric. We find an off-diagonal component even if the source has a vanishing angular momentum. Moreover, we determine the component representing the Newtonian potential. The non-spinning point source is obtained as a limit case within the framework of the Abelian Higgs model.
The concept of gravitational radiation in multidimensional Einstein gravity is studied. Due to technical difficulties the Petrov classification of the conformal tensor and the “peeling off” theorem cannot be generalized to spaces of dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> &gt; 4. A multidimensional<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em> wave is defined by analogy with that for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d =</em> 4. If the definition is supplemented by the Lichnerowicz condition for purely radiative spacetimes, the admitted solutions of the dimensionally reduced gravity theory describe a scalar (dilaton) and a gravitational<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em> wave moving in the external spacetime in the same direction. The existence of the extra dimensions can be traced back by measuring the frequence of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em> wave in the external space. The condition is equally restrictive in a more general case of the internal space being a flat anisotropic manifold (i.e. an abelian group space).
Einstein's unified field theory is extended by the addition of matter terms in the form of a symmetric energy tensor and of two conserved currents. From the field equations and from the conservation identities emerges the picture of a gravoelectrodynamics in a dynamically polarizable Riemannian continuum. Through an approximate calculation exploiting this dynamical polarizability it is argued that ordinary electromagnetism may be contained in the theory.
A novel approach has been made to the divergence problem in local field theories, in which the notion of “locality” is still retained but loses its absolute meaning, just like “simultaneity”. The basic idea is to introduce a pure-imaginary elementary length into 3-dimensional space, while keeping “time” structureless so as to retain the unitarity of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>-matrix. Consequently, light becomes dispersive at sufficiently short wavelengths, and Lorentz transformation becomes a point-to-string transformation. When reformulated to meet the new Lorentz invariance, all the localfield (in the above sense) theories in a flat space become finite,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">while retaining their conventional form</em>. This has been demonstrated by the derivation of finitized Coulomb potential and correct high-momentum behavior of quantum-electrodynamic coupling constant. For diagrams including gravitons, evaluation of the superficial degrees of divergence shows that only a restricted number of 1-(and 2-) loop diagrams might be divergent, while those of more than 3 loops are definitely convergent, thus indicating possible renormalizability (or something better) of quantum gravity in Einstein's formalism of general relativity. Since 4-dimensional simple supergravity removes 1-and 2-loop divergence, a combination of the theory and the present one might lead to a more interesting result.
The formula for the horizon of a Newtonian “dark body” is given and compared to that of a relativistic “black hole”: a Newtonian “dark body” has at least one “hair”.
It is found that, to an external observer, an object falling into a black hole is lost beyond any return, in a finite amount of time.
The vacuum Einstein equations (with cosmological constant) written in a slightly unconventional manner, can be decomposed into three parts: the first two parts are the ordinary self dual Yang-Mills equations and the anti-self dual Yang-Mills equations for an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3,1) gauge group, on an unspecified background space-time, the third part are equations that “solder” or relate these two Y-M fields and connections to the curvature and connection of that unknown space-time. It is the purpose of this note to take this point of view seriously and concentrate on the first two parts in their own right. We apply to them generalizations of solution construction techniques which have arisen from the study of self dual Yang-Mills equations on Minkowski space. At the end we discuss how to solder or bootstrap these results to the determination of the space-time itself.
Static spacetimes are studied in terms of a space-plus-time decomposition proposed by Petrov. The problem of finding invariant conformal vectors (the ones which commute with the static Killing vector) is reduced to the simpler problem of finding the isometries of a three-dimensional metric. In the perfect fluid case, all the line elements admitting proper invariant conformal vectors are explicitly given.
All string theories naively contain a massless dilaton which couples with the strength of gravity in direct violation of experiment. We present a simple mechanism for giving the dilaton a mass In unoriented open bosonic string theories.




We study the dynamics of the true vacuum in a cosmological phase transition governed by a Higgs field. When the mass of the field depends on the temperature there is a feedback mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant near zero.
In this paper we deduce the general pattern of the potential surfaces for time-like geodesics in the Curzon metric. We find that for fairly small energies and orbital angular momenta, the time-like geodesics group into two sets; the geodesics of one set tend to the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>-axis as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>=(r<sup>2</sup>+z<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>→ 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>=0 being a directional singularity, the others tend to the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-axis. At low energies these two sets are detached but they merge together as the energy increases. Stable circular motion is confined to the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 0-plane and an energy threshold for stationary motion exists and is equal (per unit of rest-mass energy) to ≈ 0.945, a value almost indistinguishable from that in the Schwarzschild space-time.
In the present work the connection between chaotic behaviour and dimensions of space-time for Mixmaster models is discussed.
In this paper, we show that the non-Newtonian gravitational potential can be explained by a scalar-tensor model with torsion in the weak field and static state approximation. The torsional effect is the intermediate-range interaction.
In this note we investigate the motion of the axis of a gyroscope freely falling along the radial geodesic in Schwarzschild space-time. It is shown that the gyroscope's axis rotates to the radial direction in the orthonormal frame as it falls into the black hole.
A solution is presented for a rotating perfect fluid in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. A complete metrical kink is seen to be present, provided that the boundary conditions are correctly formulated.
The field equations for homogeneous models in an arbitrary number of dimensions form a Hamiltonian system with constraint forces. Due to the monotonic behavior of the determinant of the induced metric, the evolution of the system can be interpreted as the motion of a particle in an explicitly time-dependent potential. Considering vacuum models, we show that this explicit time-dependence can be eliminated. Using the scaling properties of the Ricci tensor we obtain an autonomous system, for which we can also find a Liapunov function in terms of the n-dimensional Ricci curvature.
We study conformally invariant fields within the context of semi-classical gravity. We claim that, generically, conformal flatness implies Friedmann-Robertson-Walker behaviour. A proof is presented here for the case in which the Ricci tensor is of the perfect fluid type. We also rewrite the field equations as a quadratic three dimensional autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, the critical points of which are Minkowski space and de Sitter space. Both these critical points are unstable in the linear as well as in the non-linear theory.
Regions of empty spacetime with one translation symmetry and no gravitational waves can be examined with the equations of 2+1 gravity. Such regions are locally Minkowskian but may include parallel cosmic strings or wormholes that extend to infinity in the third space dimension. The time evolution problem is set in the framework of a recent constrained Hamiltonian formulation for 2+1 gravity. A wormhole developes closed timelike curves in a finite amount of time for roughly half of all possible initial conditions. A pair of cosmic strings with relative angular momentum, unlike a spinning string, does not have closed timelike curves.
We present a summary of the results, in the large scale, that were derived from the gauge-invariant (GI) cosmological density perturbation analysis. Comparisons are made with the synchronous gauge (SG) results, pointing out past incorrect analyses concerning evolution during the inflationary era and the decaying mode during the matter dominated era. The GI method, using the covariant equations, is recommended for cosmological perturbation analysis, not only because of its gauge-independence, but because of its simplicity and similarity to the Newtonian analysis. Solutions in other specific gauges can simply be recovered from the known results of the GI analysis.


The Einstein field equations are solved assuming spherical or static cylindrical symmetry and a string dust source. All solutions which may be matched on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> to an external vacuum solution having the same symmetry are found.
Dyer, McVittie and Oattes (1987) presented the field equations for shearfree perfect fluid spacetimes which are spherically symmetric and admit a conformal symmetry. Two special solutions of these equations are found. Furthermore, in the general case, one field equation is solved in terms of a Painlevé transcendent, while the remaining equation is reduced to an Emden-Fowler equation.
We show that, for the case of vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations with a spacelike hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector ∂/∂ϰ<sup>3</sup> and associated metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em><sup>2</sup> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em></sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>−2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em></sup> γ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup> where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> is not a constant, there exists at every point of the quotient 3-space a plane of vectors<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup> such that £<sub>K</sub>R<sub>ab</sub>=0 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup> R<sub>ab</sub>=0 where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R{inab}</em> is the Ricci tensor formed from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>. Then in the case where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U{in,a}</em> is a timelike or spacelike vector in the quotient 3-space, Petrov type I solutions of the vacuum field equations are obtained. In the simpler case where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U{in,a}</em> is a null vector in the quotient 3-space, the complete solution of the vacuum field equations is obtained. It is shown that this solution is Petrov type III of Kundt's class. For the case of Papapetrou solutions where there is a twist potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ψ</em> which is a function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>, solutions corresponding to the twistfree solutions are given.
By solving the coupled SU(5) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations, we obtain the exact Reissner-Nordstrom type gravitational field of a family of spherically symmetric SU(5) dyons with magnetic charge 1/2e.
The explicit matrix formulae that resolve Cartan's first structure equations with respect to connection are suggested. They do not involve matrix inversions and seem to be useful for insertion into specialized computer algebra systems.
The Kaluza-Klein unified theory predicts the existence of a Brans-Dicke type scalar field with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> = 0. Solar system experiments do, however, imply that gravitational scalar fields must be suppressed either by a very weak coupling to matter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> &gt; 500) or a self-interaction. Here the consequences of a self-interaction potential of the Kaluza-Klein scalar are investigated. By suppressing the scalar field in this way, the one-body metric reduces to the Schwarzschild solution. The cosmologies of the scalar-tensor model are, however, very different from cosmologies of Einstein's theory, since here the time evolution of the cosmic scale-factor is determined only by the initial conditions. These may be chosen so that the theory is compatible with the hypothesis of primordial nucleosynthesis.
A particular class of solutions of Einstein's field equations, in which the source is a perfect fluid and the geometry admits a two-parameter Abelian isometry group with spacelike orbits, is examined for the possible admission of higher symmetries. It is shown that in certain cases the geometry is spatially homogeneous, being either of the ‘orthogonal’ Bianchi type I or of the ‘tilted’ Bianchi-Behr type VIU<sub>h</sub> with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> = −4, and that no other cases of higher symmetry (in the sense of isometry groups) are possible. The global behaviour of the Bianchi-Behr type VIU<sub>h</sub>, models is studied, and conformal diagrams are given. This investigation is extended to the case when additional homothetic vectors are admitted, and a parallel study of the global behaviour, complete with conformal diagrams, is provided. A brief argument also shows that, within the class considered, whenever the fluid flow-lines possess identical thermal histories, the geometry is necessarily spatially homogeneous.
The classical (first integral) methods of studying restrictions on the possible motion of gravitationally interacting bodies are reviewed. The simple and flexible inequality method is extended to a similar approach to the relationship between possible forbidden motion and (asymptotic) symmetries in the relativistic few-body problem. This extended method is used to reproduce the standard results of bounded motion for a test particle in a Schwarzschild geometry. The existence of bounded motion is shown for the general relativistic few-body problem and the difficulties in determining such bounded motion is analysed. The use of this approach to obtaining a relativistic alternative to the classical Roche lobe analysis in contact binaries is discussed.
An analysis for a direct calculation of the embeddings in flat spacetimes of static spherically symmetric manifolds with Lorentz metric is worked out. For each manifold with non-constant curvature we arrive at a parametrical embedding which represents an infinite geometrical multiplicity of the embedded surface. The embeddings of manifolds with constant curvature are not parametrical and can be determined univocally. Examples concerning Schwarzschild, Reissner-Weyl, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes are considered.

In the following we find all of the three-dimensional flat spacetimes which are static and rotationally symmetric.
As is known, the expression of the electromagnetic field from a charge at rest on the symmetry axis of a Kerr spacetime, first given as a multi-polar expansion, has been later calculated in closed form. This allowed the derivation, in closed form, of the electromagnetic 4-potential and, consequently, the electrostatic self-interaction force (“self-force”) on the charge. We point out that, in order to derive the electromagnetic 4-potential and, consequently, the electrostatic self-force, a particular reference frame is required, in which the Kerr metric “locally” (i.e., in a small neighbourhood of the charge world-line) reduces to that of a static homogeneous gravitational field (SHGF). The starting point of this paper is the realization that the choice of such a reference frame in the literature is incorrect, because the phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames is neglected. This demands a new derivation both of the electromagnetic 4-potential and of the electrostatic self-force. To this end, we construct the correct reference frame, “locally“ transforming the Kerr metric into that of an SHGF. In such a frame, we derive the correct expressions both of the electromagnetic 4-potential and of the electrostatic self-force. In particular: i) the time component of the 4-potential differs from that known in the literature by an additional term, induced by the dragging of inertial frames, vanishing only on the symmetry axis; ii) the self-force turns out to be the sum of two terms, of which only the first (involving both the mass and the angular momentum per unit mass of the Kerr spacetime) is known in the literature. The second term (involving only the angular momentum per unit mass), which arises from a careful calculation and not from the additional term in the 4-potential, is a significant improvement provided by this paper.
As is known, a charge in a gravitational field experiences a (gravitationally-induced) self-interaction force (“self-force”) only in curved space-times (in any reference frame), but not in the accelerated frames in flat spacetimes. Therefore, the presence of any self-force indicates, from a formal point of view, a violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP); as a result, “observability of the self-force in the validity domain of classical electrodynamics” (CE) means “observability of the related violation of SEP”. In this paper we investigate the observability of the self-force on a charge at rest on the symmetry axis in a Kerr spacetime, as recently calculated in a paper by the same authors, in the validity domain of CE. Analysis shows that, in the validity domain of CE, no effect of the self-force is observable outside the Schwarzschild radius. In contrast, some effect is observable for very large values of the angular momentum, in a small neighbourhood of the “turning point” (where a reversal of the tidal forces direction takes place), between the outer horizon and the Schwarzschild radius. This is the only case we have found where SEP fails because of the self-force.
We investigate the class of spherically symmetric, anisotropic (principal stresses unequal) fluids admitting the existence of a vector field, assumed to be orthogonal to the four velocity of the fluid, and with respect to which the Lie derivative of the metric tensor is proportional to the shear tensor. The physical variables, as well as the evolution equation of the bounday surface, are found for different models.
A Newtonian version of the spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with variable mass is presented. Under the assumption that the mass variation is a strict cosmological effect, its influence on the evolution of the scale function is established for the case of a dust-filled universe. Unlike the usual Newtonian models the present value of the deceleration parameter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> ≏ 1) obtained from the luminosity distance versus redshift relation can be fitted for a time-decreasing mass. It is also shown that the hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic character of the fluid motion can be modified along the expansion. Likewise, a Friedmann-type equation with a variable “curvature term” indicates that in the frame-work of a full geometric variable mass theory, the same may occur with the open, flat or closed character of the universe spatial section.
We consider the Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source and variable Λ and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> for the Robertson-Walker metric. When conservation of energy momentum is postulated and the deceleration parameter is assumed constant, we find perfect gas equation of state models in the Euclidean and non-Euclidean cases. The resulting models offer an alternative to the inflationary scenario; they also explain the huge value of the cosmological term in the early universe.
We give a simple example of a spacetime in which one region undergoes gravitational collapse while another undergoes inflation. The spacetime is a spherical ball of dust in a region with a cosmological constant. The implications of this example for the “cosmic no hair” conjecture are discussed.
The problem of vacuum type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> solutions of Einstein's field equations with Killing vector and homothetic group can be reduced to a single ordinary differential equation of the third order for a single real function. Hauser's solution [4] is an exceptional case. If the homothetic parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> takes the value<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2 the third order differential equation becomes surprisingly simple. This case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2 is therefore the most promising one for the search of exact solutions.
The static field equations of general relativity are examined as deviations from a Schwarzschild solution in isotropic form. The multipole expansion is recovered with hypergeometric radial dependence.
We discuss the problem of motion of test particles in a monopolequadrupole gravitational field and compare the results presented in different publications.




Arguments based on thermodynamics and on the analysis of string creation effects in expanding spaces suggest the existence of an inflationary phase in the early universe for theories of closed strings. Einstein's equations on the other hand do not support such expectations. We solve this apparent paradox by noticing that Einstein's equations must be modified at the scale at which this inflationary phase takes place, so that the new equations satisfy the closed string duality principle. Inflation is natural in the context of such modifications and we give an estimate of the amount of inflation in this early epoch.
We give a unified derivation of a null chart for all spherically symmetric, homothetic spacetimes. These spacetimes contain an interesting class of naked singularities which we are also able to elucidate. Much use is made of graphical representation; in particular a chart of the spacetimes based on their homothetic group motions is introduced. Dust spacetimes, and two homogeneous examples with non-zero pressure (flat Robertson-Walker and a Kantowski-Sachs example) are studied in detail. We show the horizon structure in the null atlas, in comoving coordinates, in terms of the areal radius and comoving time, and in the homothetic diagrams. The critical delay between comoving observers for the onset of “nakedness” is interpreted in terms of a decreasing mass concentration in the spirit of Thorne's “hoop” conjecture. We also give a simple criterion for the existence of apparent horizons isolating the various singularities, and study in detail how this criterion is circumvented in the naked examples. We conclude that this type of naked singularity is a consequence of the imposed homothetic symmetry, by showing it to be generally present and timelike in the homothetic group chart even when it is not visible at comoving infinity (before the onset of criticality). It is the delayed final collapse of initially distant observers in inhomogeneous spacetimes that causes the initial singularity to become visible at comoving infinity. We conclude that these examples do not present an obstacle to the “Event Horizon Conjecture” as summarized by W. Israel (1984). That is, one can formulate criteria for the formation of apparent horizons that do not imply that all singularities are necessarily so enclosed. It is still possible that all singularities stronger than homothetic are isolated by an apparent horizon, in the spirit of Tipler's conjecture.
We study the propagation of light signals in two exact solutions of vacuum Einstein's equations, in the geometric optics approximation. The gravitational wave affects the frequency of light propagating in it (a known effect) even if the metric components<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>tt</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ti</sub> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em>=1, 2, 3) are zero. Moreover we find that red-/blue-shift depends on the relative spatial position of the light source and the observer, even if the wavefront is perfectly uniform, leading to a characteristic redshift pattern.
A new type of BRST-like operator<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> has been constructed for spaces with zero Riemann curvature tensor but with non-zero torsion. It is invariant under local coordinate transformation, and its proof depends upon the validity of the first Bianchi identity. Also, there exists a supersymmetry associated with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q.</em> Finally, the cohomology induced by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> has been investigated.
We present an outline of a D'Adhemar-like formulation for General Relativity, which puts emphasis on the light-cones as one of the basic variables. Two important aspects of this reformulation are: (1) it is possible (in a perturbative sense) to construct the general radiative solution for GR, i.e. one can find a (series of) integral relationships between the field and the free-characteristic data, and (2) as the light-cone itself now becomes a basic variable, one can clearly see the difficulties with the conventional view towards the problem of quantum gravity in that there is no natural way to include it in a quantization procedure.



We investigate the energy-momentum and spin field equations of gravity theory on a Riemann-Cartan space-time (including metric and torsion,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub>-manifold). The structure of the rather complicated nonlinear differential equations of second order is made considerably easier to survey by decomposing curvature into its self and anti-self double dual parts. This leads to an obvious ansatz for the self double dual curvature, whereby the field equations are reduced to Einstein's equations with cosmological term. To solve the double dual ansatz, we choose proper variables adopted to its double duality, and perform a (3+1)-decomposition of exterior calculus. We examine these equations further on a Kerr background with cosmological constant for the Riemannian geometry.
The interaction between gravitational and gauge fields is considered. A new characterization of the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations is given. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure the decomposition of the total Lagrangian density are established. The emphasis is on the general covariance requirements of the basic geometrical objects involved. This leads, among other things, to a better understanding of the role played by the Bianchi identity.
We consider the loop space representation of Rovelli and Smolin as the starting point for the analysis of quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions. To do so, we introduce observables directly within this representation and consider the problem of its Lagrangian formulation. The implications of this framework for the issue of time are discussed and the extension of these results to 3+1 gravity is also considered.

We show that supersymmetry may play an important role in giving a reasonable explanation of relevant cosmological features. We work in a classical<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1 supergravity scenario showing that supersymmetric matter leads, in the classical limit, to a fluid model acting as the source of the gravitational field. The equation of state arises, in a natural way, as a consequence of the field equations. We study conditions for the matter dominated era and the existence of an inflationary solution. Using upper bounds of several red-shift experimental results we are able to give an estimate of the corresponding Hubble constant.
We consider the evolution of a subclass of the orthogonal spatially homogeneous cosmologies of Bianchi type VI<sub>−1/9</sub>. Expansion normalized variables are introduced to write the Einstein field equations for these models as a three-dimensional autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. This system is analyzed qualitatively using the techniques of dynamical systems, and a cosmological interpretation of the phase portraits is given.
Recently, Dalton has shown that conserved vector-valued currents have null<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">covariant</em> (rather than partial) derivatives and has discussed the corollary that there is no gravitational energy-momentum in general relativity (GR). An equivalent statement on conservation of vector-valued currents was given by E. Cartan in 1922. Given the potential implications of the Dalton corollary, Cartan's contribution to this problem is reproduced here in more modern but very powerful and relatively simple language. For completeness, his accompanying work on the current of GR is also included. The question then arises of whether or not the absence of a gravitational source in GR is a problem. For the purpose of comparison, we consider the gravitational sector of teleparallelism-withtorsion theories. These exhibit field equations of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>μν</sub> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub>μν</sub>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>μν</sub>is the Einstein tensor for the Levi-Civita (part of the total) connection, which is conserved. The source now has two distinct parts, one depending on both the metric and the torsion and the other metric independent. They can be viewed as being respectively gravitational and non-gravitational. In addition, the conservation law of these theories is global. It thus follows that several unesthetic (and certainly controversial) features of GR should be viewed as real problems, and not as necessary concomitants of the geometrization of the physics.




We discuss the possible modification of Einstein's theory of gravitation due to the fifth force generated by the Kaluza-Klein dilaton. In particular we discuss the gravitational redshift, the deflection of light, the precession of perihelia, and the time-delay of radar echo around a spherically symmetric black hole in a 7-dimensional Kaluza-Klein unification which has<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sub>2</sub> as the internal isometry. It is shown that the long-range effect of the higher-dimensional fifth force is characterized by the dilatonic charge carried by the black hole even when it is neutral.
Spherically symmetric solutions coupled to massive scalar particles in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory are obtained. The solutions contain two event horizons. The inner horizon corresponds to the Schwarzschild black hole and the outer one is a new horizon which is produced by the massive scalar particles. It is found that the massive modes contribute an effective cosmological constant to the four-dimensional Einstein theory.
Up to now calculations of the interaction of cosmic strings have neglected gravity. We consider the purely gravitational interactions that occur at large distances, using the conical line singularity for the gravitational field of a string. We construct spaces with multiple intersecting conical strings, that are exactly consistent with General Relativity, and which can be covered in a single Minkowski coordinate patch, using a Regge calculus type construction. We show that after two such strings pass through each other they remain connected by another string, and we derive the branching rules which govern the junction of three strings. These rules apply to conical type strings in any smoothly curved background, whether they are straight or curved, moving or stationary, and they show that, at the junction, the three strings must be as coplanar as is possible in such a space. For these results to be matched onto the short range results of Field Theory calculations, it is suggested that gravitational radiation must be introduced. This would mean that gravitation is not negligible in these interactions.
We present the nature of stable trajectories of neutral particles around an object with a quadrupole moment in both the equatorial (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ=π</em>/2) and the polar (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>=constant) plane.
In this paper the spin-coefficient formalism of Penrose and Rindler is applied to the problem of finding space-times that admit a simply-transitive group of homotheties. The method is illustrated by an application to algebraically special vacuum space-times. Vacuum metrics with a fivedimensional homothety group are also considered.
The geometrical unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism discussed in previous publications requires that electromagnetism be represented by an SU(2) subgroup. Electric matter should correspond to irreducible representations of the structure group, SL(4,ℝ), induced from its compact subgroup, rotation SU(2)x electromagnetic SU(2). Results predict the quantization of electric charge, magnetic flux and angular momentum without requiring magnetic monopoles. Unexpectedly, the necessary quanta of charge and flux imply fractional quantization of transverse resistance, under certain conditions (Fractional Quantum Hall Effect).
We extend a method by Goldman to include conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for construction of physically acceptable relativistic fluid spheres. We thus give the conditions for having finite and non-negative pressure and finite and positive density inside the fluid sphere. We also give conditions for the pressure gradient and the density gradient to be negative and for the speed of sound to be less than the speed of light in vacuum. We further give the condition for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor to be positive and for the relativistic adiabatic index to be larger than 4/3. A model given by Goldman is examined, and we find that all these conditions are fulfilled. We further show that this model is stable. However, we also give a class of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new</em> exact solutions, and show that these models are physically valied. These models are also stable with respect to small radial disturbances. We calculated the total mass, the density and the physical radius for these fluid spheres. Some of these spheres turn out to be extremely compact. They can have a radius of only several centimeters, but typically contain the mass of a planet. We put these models forward as tentative exact solutions for spheres which could contain the hidden dark matter in the universe.
It is shown that, in the case where there is a single non-null Killing vector, the vacuum Einstein field equations imply that there is a Ricci collineation in the quotient 3-space. Using coordinates adapted to the collineation vector, we derive a fourth order partial differential equation involving the metric of the quotient 3-space and we show that if this equation is satisfied, the Ernst potential may be obtained by integrating a total Riccati equation and a straightforward set of total differential equations. We also show that if the collineation vector is null, the metric of the quotient 3-space may be expressed in terms of two real Clebsch potentials. Finally in the special case where the collineation vector is the generator of a timelike homothetic motion we reduce the field equations to a single second order partial differential equation of non-Painlevé type in two independent variables and obtain Petrov type III solution of Robinson-Trautman type.
It is well known that the Penrose process (PP) is a way for extracting energy from a black hole (BH). An analytical and partially numerical study of the PP is presented for a particular case: an incoming particle, at rest at infinity, decays into two photons inside the ergoregion of a Kerr BH, assuming that all particles follow equatorial orbits. It is shown that this process cannot exist if the angular momentum of the BH is lower than a critical value. Considering the features of the non equatorial Kerr geodesics, it is conjectured that even when the incoming particle is not at rest at infinity and the trajectories are not equatorial, the critical value still holds. This lower limit on the angular momentum implies that not all the rotational energy of the BH could be extracted with the Penrose processes that we have considered.
Within the concept of extended elementary particles proposed by the author in some previous papers the mass formula of the general stationary spherically symmetric and purely electrical solution of the 5-dimensional vacuum equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>μυ</sub>=0 is calculated. The problem of how to establish a discrete mass spectrum is discussed in detail.
We study the dynamics of the generalized<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 1+3+d) Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models in the framework of an extended gravity theory obtained by adding the Gauss-Bonnet term to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action. In our discussion we extensively use methods of dynamical systems. We consider models filled in with a perfect fluid obeying the equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=(γ−1)ρ and vacuum but non-flat models. We present a detailed analysis of the ten dimensional model and in particular we study the vacuum case. Several phase portraits show how the evolution of this model depends on the parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>.
We show that some striking properties of the circular motion of charged, ultrarelativistic particles close to the circular photon orbit around a charged black hole (found by Balek, Bičák and Stuchlík) can be easily understood in terms of the centrifugal force vanishing at the circular photon orbit. We also comment briefly on a possible non-uniqueness of the recently-proposed operational definition of the centrifugal force in static spacetimes.
Some simple observations are made to clear up misconceptions regarding the behavior of spatially homegeneous monotonically expanding general relativistic cosmological models at very late times, as well as to emphasize some simple features of the dynamics in the direction away from an initial singularity even in the case of recollapse. A few examples illustrating these ideas are discussed, including the derivation of some approximate solutions of the late stage field equations.
We consider the (massless) scalar field on 2-dimensional manifolds whose metric changes signature and which admit a spacelike isometry. Choosing the wave equation so that there will be a conserved Klein-Gordon product implicitly determines the junction conditions one needs to impose in order to obtain global solutions. The resulting mix of positive and negative frequencies produced by the presence of Euclidean regions depends only on the total width of the regions, and not on the detailed form of the metric.
It is shown that torsion can be built from two independent vector fields, and that these vector fields obey, for the Lagrangian chosen, the equations of electromagnetism with magnetic charge from the two photon formalism. The equation of motion follows from the Bianchi identity of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><sub>4</sub> spacetime, and finally the interpretation of these fields is discussed.
Einstein-Maxwell theory in 2+1 dimensions is considered as a toy model for the 3+1 theory and as a means for understanding field theories without a background space-time geometry. Two possible approaches to the quantization of this theory are presented, one based on a Schwinger-Tomonaga time evolution equation and the other on a loop space construction, and the problems arising in both of these are discussed.
The full coupled Einstein scalar gauge field equations are obtained together with the high-frequency perturbations on a cylindrical symmetric background. The vortex solution and the first order perturbations depend critically on the parameters of the model. In the static case, an exact solution of the vortex is found. In the nondiagonal case, an axial component of the gauge field is necessary in order to fulfil the energy equation.
In this paper we have obtained the general vacuum solution for Bianchi type V in the Brans-Dicke theory. It is shown that for the special case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>=0, the sourceless scalar field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em> is dynamically an essential factor which determines the cosmological expansion parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> and the singularity does not occur when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=0.
The exact solutions of Einstein's (vacuum) field equations corresponding to a (real-poles) three-solitonic perturbation of a Bianchi type II space-time are investigated by using computer algebra. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional plots of the relevant solitonic fields are obtained numerically.
For space-times in general relativity, the Petrov classification of the Weyl conformai curvature and the Plebański or Segre classification of the Ricci tensor each depend on the properties of the roots of quartic equations. The coefficients in these quartic equations are in general complicated functions of the space-time coordinates. We review the general theory of quartic equations, and discuss algorithms for determining the existence and values of multiple roots. We consider practical implementation of an algorithm and the consequent Petrov classification. Tests of programs embodying this algorithm, using the computer algebra system CLASSI based on SHEEP, are reported.
Some basic concepts about curvature collineations are reviewed and the existing results on this topic are applied to the case of perfect fluids, giving a characterization of those amongst them which admit proper curvature collineations.
In Finsler spaces the interval<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ds</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>) is an arbitrary function of the coordinates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> and coordinate increments<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em> homogeneous of degree one in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dx</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>.

The subset of such Finsler spaces with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>.(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sup>) a vector or second rank decomposable tensor is determined.

All the three primordial phases of the universe, required by inflation, plus what is believed to be the present phase, have been studied in the Einstein-Cartan cosmological model in a Bianchi type I metric.
In the Einstein-Cartan theory coupled to a classical spin fluid only the traceless part of the torsion field can be related to spin. Here the theory is generalized by allowing intrinsic dilation currents which couple algebraically to the torsion trace. The intrinsic dilation current is interpreted as the relative change of intrinsic length scales relative to the gravitational length scale. By a dilation current conservation law, one finds the scale function between the atomic length scales and the gravitational length scales. This is in effect a dynamic unification of the atomic and gravitational units of measurement. The theory is applied to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, and physical effects in the solar system are considered.
Spacetimes admitting a covariantly constant vector and satisfying the Einstein field equations for a perfect fluid, a viscous heat-conducting fluid, or an anisotropic fluid are studied. It is found that the only possible perfect fluid spacetimes are the Einstein static universe and ‘stiff-matter’ spacetimes with an isolated spatial co-ordinate, while the possible viscous fluid and anisotropic fluid spacetimes, although more abundant than their perfect fluid counterparts, must satisfy a number of strong restrictions. Examples illustrating most of the various possible situations are given. The paper concludes with a study of covariantly constant second-rank tensors in fluid spacetimes; the only possible solutions that do not also admit a covariantly constant vector are restricted to 2+2 spacetimes.
It is shown that all axially symmetric non-rotating solutions of Rosen's field equations can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions as well as that the total energy of Rosen's metric is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mc</em><sup>2</sup>.
In this paper we present anisotropic families of cosmological solutions in the 5-dimensional space-time-mass theory of gravity. In particular, the 5D analogue of the Kasner solution of General Relativity is obtained. Some comments are given on the solutions.
The gauge-invariance of the calculations determining anisotropics in the cosmic microwave background radiation (the Sachs-Wolfe effect) is re-examined. It is shown that the results obtained are gauge-invariant only if a physically-based definition of the surface of last scattering is implemented, in a context where perturbations of the surface of last scattering as well as of the space-time are taken into account. Any physical interpretation of the results based on their splitting into ‘scalar’, ‘vector’, and ‘tensor’ parts, is unique only if non-local (unverifiable) conditions are imposed; locally, any such interpretation is non-unique. The physical meaning of the Sachs-Wolfe potential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> and associated redshift formula depends on implementing a very specific gauge, without a clear physical or geometric meaning; its implications do not extend to other, more usual, gauges.
Electromagnetism is coupled to torsion in a gauge invariant manner by relaxing minimal coupling and introducing into the Lagrangian a term bilinear in the electromagnetic field tensor and the torsion potential. The resulting coupling between electromagnetism and torsion is examined and a solution corresponding to traveling coupled waves is given.
We present conditions under which there occurs a dynamical dimensional reduction of cosmological models in the form of Bianchi I×(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-3)-dimensional torus filled with matter of the ideal fluid type.
We propose a unified phenomenological theory to investigate the interaction between arbitrarily moving superconductors and gravitational fields including the Newtonian gravity, gravitational waves, vector transverse gravitoelectric fields, and vector gravitomagnetic fields. In the limit of weak field and low velocity, the expressions for the induced electromagnetic and gravitational fields in the interior of a moving superconductor are obtained. The Meissner effect, London moment, DeWitt effect, effects of gravitational wave on a superconductor, and induced electric fields in the interior of a freely vibrating superconductor are recovered from these two expressions. We demonstrate that the weak equivalence principle is valid in superconductivity, that Newtonian gravity and gravitational waves will penetrate either a moving superconductor or a superconductor at rest, and that a superconductor at rest cannot shield either vector gravitomagnetic fields or vector transverse gravitoelectric fields.
Recent determinations of globular cluster ages imposes severe problems for the standard cosmological models. Before introducing a cosmological constant, other possibilities of solving the problem should be investigated carefully. In this paper, the backreactions of inhomogeneities in realistic, clumpy universes and their influence on age determinations are studied. Applying a recently developed approximation scheme, it is shown that the backreactions lead to an underestimation of the age of the universe as inferred from a measurement of today's Hubble parameter. Observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation impose constraints on the parameters. For a simple model within the framework of pancake theory for structure formation on a flat expanding background, it is shown that the age problem may be solved by taking into account the backreactions of inhomogeneities in an averaged sense. No cosmological constant is needed.
Cosmology with the gravitational and cosmological constants generalized as coupling scalars in Einstein's theory is considered. A general method of solving the field equations is given. Fifteen exact solutions for zero pressure models satisfying<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>0</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R/R</em><sub>0</sub>)<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup>are given in the Appendix; they are briefly discussed.
A Lorentz-invariant model of vacuum is given in the form of a 7-dimensional manifold endowed with a statistical metrical tensor. Certain scalar fields on this manifold behave then as spinor fields when viewed from their space-time projection. This paper generalizes previous work from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3)-covariance to Lorentz-covariance.

We study the Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions coupled to matter in two distinct ways. In the first we reduce the Lagrangian to an effective four-dimension one and then we couple it to matter; in the second, we introduce matter directly in the original five-dimensional theory. In both cases we use a non trivial configuration for the Maxwell potential. We find non singular solutions which present a repulsive gravitational phase. When this phase is absent, the initial singularity is unavoidable.
The propagation of perturbations on a spatially flat Robertson-Walker background is studied within linear perturbation theory in deDonder gauge and for comparison in synchronous gauge. The metric perturbations should be determined uniquely by the density/pressure perturbations, therefore only two initial conditions, namely for the density contrast and its time derivative, should be needed. Since the number of fundamental solutions for the density perturbations is higher than 2 in both gauges (6 resp. 3) an additional reduction of possible initial conditions, resp. a physically motivated exclusion of solutions, is needed. It is shown that the common treatment of excluding the so-called gauge solutions (solutions which can be gauged to zero in an already chosen gauge) leads to unphysical results. If gauge solutions are excluded the density perturbation solutions are the same in both gauges. But the correct Newtonian limit — which is present in deDonder gauge but not in synchronous gauge — is bound to the differences in the two gauges for large spatial scales of perturbations. Furthermore, compressional wave solutions should vanish for infinite spatial scales of perturbations (isotropy), but this is guaranteed in deDonder gauge by gauge solutions again. Gauge solutions should therefore not be taken as unphysical.
We consider a special class of stationary rotating charged dust solutions of Einstein's field equations without cosmological constant. In these space-times, the motion of freely falling particles and of light rays can be visualized by the motion of charged particles in an appropriate model magnetic field. Any curl-free magnetostatic field, given on an open subset of Euclidean 3-space, can serve as a model magnetic field for a charged dust solution in this sense. The simplest example, corresponding to a homogeneous model magnetic field, is given by Som-Raychaudhuri space-time. Some other examples are worked out.
In the case of self dual metrics, we detail and put together the Geroch three-dimensional formulation of the Einstein equations and the Boyer-Finley results on Killing vectors to obtain a set of complex coordinates and a Kähler potential for the Atiyah-Hitchin metric.
The Einstein field equations for a number of classes of cosmological models have previously been written as polynomial systems of ordinary differential equations. We show that, for restricted parameter values, these equations admit algebraic invariant curves, which, in turn, lead to exact solutions of the field equations. This property explains the recent discovery of a number of exact solutions and is used to produce additional ones.
To explain the discrepancy between recently computed vanishing Liapunov exponents for the evolution of Mixmaster universes and the positive Liapunov exponent for the associated 1-dimensional map first discussed by Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz, the Liapunov exponents computed from a numerical universe evolution are compared using several time variables. Previous numerical results of vanishing Liapunov exponents were obtained with time variables which increased roughly exponentially in each epoch. Here it is found that minisuperspace proper time, which increases by a fixed amount during each epoch, yields nonvanishing Liapunov exponents within the limited number of epochs numerically accessible. The map parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> as measured along the trajectory attains the values predicted by the map to very high accuracy (except near the maximum of expansion) even though the metric coefficients deviate in some cases from idealized Mixmaster behavior. The number of consecutive single epoch eras is shown to be related to the presence of u in an interval bounded by ratios of Fibonacci numbers.
As an introduction to the use of self-dual variables on a null cone, the Hamiltonian for the Maxwell field is set up on a null cone in Minkowski space. In this treatment, the vector potential (the connection) and the self-dual components of the Maxwell field are treated as independent configuration space variables. Because the initial surface is a null cone, additional primary and secondary constraints arise. These constraints can be grouped into first class and second class. The elimination of the second class constraints together with the reality conditions on the vector potential, reduce the independent phase space variables to two. In its final form the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the product of the self-dual Maxwell field and its complex conjugate.
In the context of Classical General Relativity, assuming the positive energy condition, we study the possibility of connecting a region where some dimensions are compact to another region where compactification does not exist. In some simple models, where compactification is achieved through the condensation of gauge fields, we find that the matching of these two regions implies the existence of a wormhole. We also discuss the possibility of spontaneous quantum nucleation of a compactified phase in the midst of an uncompactified space.
The simplest interpretation of the CMBR dipole anisotropy is that it arises due to our motion with respect to the cosmic rest frame. However, the existence of a superhorizon-sized isocurvature perturbation can give rise to a dipole anisotropy intrinsic to the CMBR. In this case the cosmic rest frame and the CMBR rest frame<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">do not</em> coincide, and when viewed from the CMBR rest frame the universe appears “tilted”: matter streams uniformly from one side of the universe to the other. The intrinsic dipole model provides an explanation for the puzzling observation that most of the matter within a l00ℏ<sup>−1</sup> Mpc cube centered on our galaxy has a large velocity (of order 600 km s<sup>−1</sup>) with respect to the CMBR rest frame.
A black hole may carry quantum numbers that are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> associated with massless gauge fields, contrary to the spirit of the “no-hair” theorems. The “quantum hair” is invisible in the classical limit, but measurable via quantum interference experiments. Quantum hair alters the temperature of the radiation emitted by a black hole. It also induces non-zero expectation values for fields outside the event horizon; these expectation values are non-perturbative in ℏ, and decay exponentially far from the hole. The existence of quantum hair demonstrates that a black hole can have an intricate quantum-mechanical structure that is completely missed by standard semiclassical theory.
The strength of Einstein's empty-space field equations is computed anew and shown to be equal to the amount of initial data required for a local solution of the equations. This same amount of initial data is shown to be precisely that required for a set of 16 unknown first-order differential equations containing 10 field variables and having six identities of second order. The 10 field variables must be functions of second order in the metric coefficients. The 16 field equations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αβμσ</em> </sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> = 0 where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αβμσ</em> </sup> is Weyl's conformal tensor, are shown to have the same properties as those of the unknown equations, suggesting that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">αβμσ</em> </sup> = 0 is a satisfactory local first-order formulation of Einstein's second-order empty-space field equations.
New exact asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations for the description of the exterior gravitational field of a static and stationary mass with an arbitrary mass-multipole structure are presented.
Some perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's field equations are obtained in spacetimes with two hypersurface orthogonal space-lika commuting Killing vectors. The flow is assumed to be geodesic. The solutions depend on an arbitrary function of time which determines the equation of state. In the models derived one additional Killing vector exists and the solutions are actually Bianchi-type cosmological models.
An investigation of those cases of the generalized Friedmann equation which are solvable in terms of elementary or elliptic functions is undertaken together with a study of the time gauges which allow this to occur. This is accomplished by examining the natural choices of independent and dependent variables in this problem using manipulations like those of the Kepler problem, which is shown to be equivalent to a generalized Friedmann problem, thus clarifying the similarities between the simplest solutions of each.
A new conformal creation field cosmology is considered and it is found that a negative energy scalar field nonminimally coupled to the gravitational field gives rise to creation and, in contrast to Hoyle-Narlikar theory, no a priori assumption about the rate of creation is required to solve the field equations.
For vacuum, type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, twisting gravitational fields the Einstein field equations reduce to partial differential equations for two functions, one real, the other complex, which may be regarded as initial data on a local<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em><sup>+</sup>. If it is assumed that in some frame these initial data take on a certain product form, one factor involving only a spatial variable, the other only a retarded time variable, then these equations become relatively tractable and reduce further to two ordinary differential equations. Rejecting all solutions which lead to Minkowski space or to zero twist leaves just two possibilities. One corresponds to the only explicitly known spacetime of the kind, namely that of Hauser. The other leads to new type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> twisting metrics. However, these metrics can be constructed explicitly only once a single nonlinear third-order ordinary differential equation has been solved.
The Einstein-Cartan field equations are solved for a string source with spin-polarisation along the axis of symmetry. The interior solution is matched to an exterior vacuum space-time using Arkuszewski-Kopczyński-Ponomariev junction conditions. The exterior solution is a four dimensional extension of the space-time outside a spinning point particle in three dimensional Einstein theory. It reduces to the geometry outside a conventional straight cosmic string in the case of vanishing spin.

Cosmological models for a universe with expansion and rotation are considered. In particular, we analyse some effects of the universal rotation on the observational cosmology. It is shown that pure cosmic rotation does not produce neither causality voilations, nor parallax effects, nor anisotropy of the microwave background radiation. It can be detected by studying angular dependence of standard cosmological tests, and is directly measurable via polarization observations.
It is shown that strong curvature naked singularities form in a non-self-similar gravitational collapse of radiation. The imploding radiation space-times with a general form of mass function are analyzed and we show that a strong curvature property holds along all families of non-spacelike geodesies terminating at the singularity in past. In view of the strength of singularity and the non-self-similar nature of space-time, we believe this is a very serious counter-example which must be taken into account for any possible formulation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis.
The problem of elastomechanical equilibrium for a static, spherically symmetric star composed of an elastic material is analyzed. A suitable formulation of relativistic elasticity theory is used, and the second order equilibrium equations are found. It is shown that the equilibrium conditions with “anisotropic pressure” introduced<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> by some authors are in fact the dynamical conditions for a relativistic elastic material. The corresponding first order equations for the components of the metric and of the energy-momentum tensor reduce to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkhoff equations if the material exhibits no shape-rigidity. Two interesting classes of solutions are discussed.
A rigorous derivation of the constraint algebra between lapse, shift and Lorentz Hamiltonians is presented assuming that only local Poincaré symmetry constraints are present in the theory. It is also shown that the Dirac-Arnowitt-Deser-Misner form of the Hamiltonian is merely a consequence of the local Poincaré symmetry identities.
The existence of Newtonian analogs to spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models of the relativistic 5D Wesson variable mass theory is investigated. By treating the continuous universe “matter creation process” by the methods of standard hydrodynamics, it is shown that classical analogs are obtained only if the cosmological constant is null and the spatial curvature is positive.
Non-stationary cylindrically symmetric one-parameter solutions to Einstein's equations are given for a perfect fluid. There is a time singularity (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>=0) at which the pressure<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> are equal to +∞ throughout the radial coordinate range 0 ≤<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> &lt; ∞, but the solutions are well behaved for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> &gt; 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> decreasing steadily to zero as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> increases through the range 0≤r&lt;∞, or as t increases through the range 0&lt;t&lt;∞. The motion is irrotational with shear, expansion and acceleration. The family of solutions, of Petrov type I, are generally spatially inhomogeneous, of class B(ii), having two spacelike Killing vectors which are mutually orthogonal and hypersurface orthogonal, associated with an orthogonally transitive group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>2</sub>. The particular members for which there are equations of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p=μ/</em>3 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=μ are specially considered.
We examine the coupled Einstem-Euler-Lagrange equations for nonstationary cosmic strings. Self-consistent solutions to all the equations are found under the assumption that the energy-momentum tensor is of the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>t</sub> <sup>t</sup> </span>=T<span class="Stack"> <sub>z</sub> <sup>z</sup> </span>while all other components vanish. It is shown that the strings are necessarily static in this case and that the scalar field potential must be of the usual quartic form with the coupling constants satisfying e<sup>2</sup>=8<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em>.
This paper deals with two aspects of relativistic cosmologies with closed spatial sections. These spacetimes are based on the theory of general relativity, and admit a foliation into space sections<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>(t), which are spacelike hypersurfaces satisfying the postulate of the closure of space: each<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>(t) is a three-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold. The topics discussed are: (i) a comparison, previously obtained, between Thurston geometries and Bianchi-Kantowski-Sachs metrics for such three-manifolds is here clarified and developed; and (ii) the implications of global inhomogeneity for locally homogeneous three-spaces of constant curvature are analyzed from an observational viewpoint.
All the points of a string are always causally connected provided their relative acceleration is smaller than the critical value<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em><sub>c</sub>= (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mαá</em>)<sup>−1</sup> where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> is the mass and 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α′</em> the string tension. It is pointed out that this limiting acceleration characterizes the transition to an unstable regime, in which an approximate description of the string motion around the classical path of a point particle is no longer consistent.



The spherically symmetric vacuum stress-energy tensor with one assumption concerning its specific form generates the exact analytic solution of the Einstein equations which for large<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> coincides with the Schwarzschild solution, for small<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> behaves like the de Sitter solution and describes a spherically symmetric black hole singularity free everywhere.
We present two methods for solving the cosmological equations of the scalar-tetradic theory B [19] when a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry is assumed. Among the many solutions found there are several physically meaningful ones including inflationary universe solutions.
An extension of the original Rainich-Misner-Wheeler (RMW) theorem to include Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes with geometrical sources has recently been accomplished by generalizing the geometrical arena from the linear frame bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">LM</em> to the bundle of biframes<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. The assumptions of a Riemannian connection one-form on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">LM</em> and a general connection one-form on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sup>2</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> necessarily implies the existence of a difference form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K.</em> We provide new algebraic and differential conditions on an arbitrary triple (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g, K</em>), in addition to those already imposed by the generalization of the RMW theorem, which guarantee the form of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell field equations associated with a charged perfect fluid spacetime. All physical quantities associated with these field equations, namely the Maxwell field strength, the mass-energy density, the pressure, the electric and magnetic charge to mass ratios, and the unit four velocity of the fluid, can be recovered from the geometry as they are constructible entirely from the metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>, the difference form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>, and their derivatives.
It is argued that one-way passage is inconsistent with Newtonian physics and thus the dark bodies as thought of by Michell and Laplace cannot be considered as exact analogues of relativistic black holes.
A classical model of the spinning electron in general relativity consisting of a rotating charge distribution with Poincaré stresses is set up. It is made out of a continuous superposition of thin charged shells with differential rotation. Each elementary shell is maintained in stationary equilibrium in the gravitational field created by the others. A class of interior solutions of the Kerr-Newman field is thus obtained. The corresponding stress-energy tensor naturally splits into the sum of two terms. The first one is the Maxwell tensor associated to a rotating charge distribution, and the second one corresponds to a material source having zero energy density everywhere, no radial pressure, and an isotropic transverse stress. These negative pressures or tensions are identified with the cohesive forces introduced by Poincaré to stabilize the Lorentz electron model. They are shown to be the source of a negative gravitational mass density and thereby of the violation of the energy conditions inside the electron.
We examine sources of error in the geometrodynamic (or “Marzke-Wheeler”) clock, and choose parameters to minimize the total error. In theories with time-varying masses, there is an unavoidable minimum error. For a human-scale clock, the dominant error is from quantum uncertainty in the photon location.
We investigate traversible wormhole solutions to the Einstein field equations in (2 + 1) dimensions. The constraints on the field equations to obtain a wormhole solution are presented and further constraints for traversibility of the wormhole are also given. We show that there is no analog of the (3 + 1)-dimensional Schwarzschild wormhole in (2 + 1) dimensions. For general wormholes, the radial tension and lateral pressure at the throat of the wormhole must be zero, and the energy density must be negative. Two specific wormhole solutions are presented. We perform a stability analysis on the solutions.
In this paper we analyze the class of Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) as sources of Gravitational Radiation, basing our analysis only on known objects (168 CVs taken from the recent Ritter Catalog), as we have already done in two previous papers for two other classes of astrophysical objects, eccentric binaries and pulsars. We try to evaluate the Gravitational Wave background, outlining all the potentially interesting sources, in two different ways, showing the substantial agreement of the results obtained. Although not completely new, such results are based on real samples of data, plus some statistical analysis, and therefore constitute a solid basis for planning the construction of GW detectors (especially space-borne GW antennas). Moreover, they provide the possibility of experimentally proving the effectiveness of the mechanism of Gravitational Radiation on CV evolution. Furthermore, for the sake of completeness, the GW emission from the known low-mass X-ray binaries and CV related objects has been evaluated.


We consider Einstein's equations with variable gravitational coupling<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and cosmological term Λ. For a power-law time-dependence of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, the cosmological term varies in proportion to the inverse square of the time, provided the equation of state is not that of vacuum. There is then no dimensional constant associated with Λ. For a vacuum equation of state the model is compatible with classical inflation for a wide class of functions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G(t)</em> and Λ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>). For non-power-law behaviour of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G(t)</em>, it is possible to have a scale factor that increases exponentially without a vacuum equation of state. For this case the energy density associated with Λ decreases exponentially, while at time zero it is equal with opposite sign to the regular energy density, so there is zero total energy initially.
Under the assumption of a pulsar's magnetic field originating from the net polarized spin of its neutrons, and by using the post-Newtonian approximated torsion in the fifth order in (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v/c</em>), the spin precession arising from torsion is coordinate dependent, which influences the magnetic field of the pulsar and makes the magnetic inclination close to the rotation axis. Assuming the possibility of the magnetic inclination density to be in random alignment at the initial time, our theoretical calculations show that most pulsars should have smaller inclinations at the age of 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> yr, and that the inclination decreases with the increasing age of the pulsar. This fits the theoretical calculations and astronomically observed distribution.
The consequences of a period of Weyl invariance in the early universe are investigated. It is argued that the natural outcome of such a period is a Kaluza-Klein style compactification of an internal space in which any time variation of the scale factor of this space is absorbed (via a Weyl transformation) into the gravitational coupling. A five-dimensional test model is shown to undergo exponential inflation of the space-time sector due to a false vacuum state of the non-metric part of the connection.
A simple vacuum cosmological solution that is a function of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ct, Gm/c</em><sup>2</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">eG</em><sup>1/2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup> is obtained in the 6D space-time-mass-charge universe which is proposed by Wesson [1] with the introduction of the sixth coordinate of charge in order to obtain a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism along the line of his original 5D space-time-mass universe [2]. It reduces to a similar solution to that of the radiation era in the 4D FRW universe through the compactifications of the extra dimensions. The trajectory of a “test particle” in the 6D universe is also studied by using the solution.
Following the techniques used by Letelier and Stachel some exact Bianchi III cosmological solutions of massive strings in the presence of magnetic field are obtained and their physical features are discussed. Some string solutions in which magnetic fields are absent are also discussed.
Canonical forms are obtained for the metrics of space-times admitting a surface generating Killing pair, one member of which is hypersurface orthogonal.
Finsler geometry is considered as a wider framework for analysing solar system tests of theories of gravity than is afforded by Riemannian geometry. The post-Newtonian limit for the spherically symmetric one-body problem is examined by expanding the Finsler metric about the Minkowski space of Special Relativity for those Finsler spaces whose null surface is Riemannian. In such a framework there are five PPN parameters instead of the three in Riemannian geometry. The classical solar system tests can readily be satisfied leaving two arbitrary parameters. These parameters could be determined from measurements of the second order gravitational red-shift and periodic perturbations in particle orbits, thus providing a consistency check on the Riemannian metric hypothesis of General Relativity. Such an experiment is possible on a satellite on an orbit with perihelion of a few solar radii.
A survey of black hole physics in two spacetime dimensions is presented. Basic properties, specific solutions and quantum aspects are considered in turn. The relationship between string theoretic black holes and those arising in other (1+l)-dimensional theories of gravity is discussed.
The empty space field equations are solved for one of the canonical forms obtained previously by Vaz and Collinson for the metrics of space-times admitting a surface generating Killing pair, one member of which is hypersurface orthogonal.


Using the five-dimensional potential formalism, a set of six new stationary axisymmetric solutions to the Kaluza-Klein field equations are constructed from the one dimensional subspace of the potential space. All the solutions have scalar potential and magnetic field, two of them possess magnetic monopoles and the other describes a magnetic dipole.
An algorithm is given for determining the isometry group of an arbitrary spacetime (in four dimensions). Numerous examples are given and the partial implementation of this algorithm using the symbolic manipulation package CLASSI is discussed.
A geometrical model for the process of field quantization is proposed, within the context of the unified theory of connections and frames, introduced in previous publications. A physical geometry produced by matter determines locally a canonical bracket operation for generalized Jacobi vector fields and provides a geometrical model for the existence of fermionic and bosonic operator fields and their rules of quantization.
A ball filled with a light-gas is studied in the frame of GR in the spherically symmetric case. Equations of motion suitable for the numerical solution are developed and it is shown that the variables of the gravitational field can be excluded from the equations of motion, thus reducing the gravitational interaction into an equivalent direct interaction of the matter with itself. The stationary states, oscillation modes and instability modes are computed and the processes of decay of unstable states and of collapse are studied.
In general relativity the non-covariant ansatz<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em><sub>4</sub><sup>i</sup> for the vectorpotential<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub> gives the general solution of the Maxwell equations as four coordinate conditions which are the conditions of integrability of the Einstein equations. In the some sense the ansatz<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup>4</sup> is a general solution of the scalar wave-equation in a reference system given by one coordinate-condition. We discuss the meaning of the canonical quantization of the fields in such reference systems.
During the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991 in Mexico the period of a torsion pendulum was measured in order to reexamine possible anomalies observed in previous experiments of this kind. In our experiment no significant change was found as the relative change in the period associated with the eclipse was less than 2.0×10<sup>−6</sup> (90% confidence). Results were similar to our previous ones made during the eclipse in 1990 in Finland when the Sun was much lower in the horizon. However, two small but distinct shifts were observed in the horizontal position of the pendulum wire which were well correlated with the beginning and the end of the eclipse.
This article is a review of interpretations which have been given to some well known solutions of the vacuum equations. Special attention is paid to those of Schwarzschild, Curzon and Kerr, and it is argued that the bizarre topologies they have been endowed with are physically unrealistic. Among others discussed are the two-centres solution of Bach and Weyl, the NUT solution, and solutions for an infinite line-mass, both static and rotating.
A systematic study of the Robinson-Trautman metrics in the asymptotic future is presented. As a by-product another technique, that could be used for determining existence of solutions of the Robinson-Trautman equation, is found. All these metrics present an exponential asymptotic limit to the Schwarzschild metric in this regime.
In 1987, Dyer, McVittie and Oattes determined the general relativistic field equations for a shear-free perfect fluid with spherical symmetry and a conformal Killing vector in the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t-r</em> plane, which depend on an arbitrary constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. Two particular solutions of these equations were given recently by Maharaj, Leach and Maartens, as well as a partial solution thought to be valid for almost all<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. In this paper, this solution is completed for four values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, and it is shown that it cannot be completed for any others by currently available techniques; however, a new solution of a different form, but also depending on a Weierstrass elliptic function, is found for a further value of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. None of these metrics are conformally flat; one of them has a constant expansion rate.

In the following we give a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) radiation gauge in a curved space-time with isometry. This criterion is purely geometric and leads to a (local) 3+1-split of space-time with vanishing extrinsic curvature. If the symmetry is timelike and in absence of charges the generalization of the Coulomb gauge leads to a time evolution of the Maxwell field which is analogous to that in flat space-time.
We systematically review the solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations for the axially symmetric stationary case which are harmonic maps. In particular, we show that the interesting part of the Kerr solution is a composition of a harmonic map into<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span> with a totally geodesic map from<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span> into SS(1,1). We also point out, relying on Sanchez' results, that there is an analogous structure for the Lorentz-domain cases involving cylindrical gravitational waves and colliding plane waves.
Normally, when a spacetime splitting is considered the ADM 3+1 split is brought to mind. In this paper, the idea of spacetime splitting is extended to include an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m + n</em> splitting of spacetime. The global spacetime has dimension (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m + n</em>) and the foliating spaces have dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. There are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> independent normals to each of these foliating spaces, thus giving<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> different extrinsic curvatures. The generalised Gauss-Weingarten and the generalised Gauss-Codazzi equations associated with this splitting are derived. These generalised equations reduce to the familar ADM equations when a 3+1 split is considered. The generalised equations are found to have a particularly elegant form when an orthogonal splitting of spacetime is examined.
Bianchi type V solutions of the Einstein equations are studied using the Hamiltonian approach. Explicit expressions depending on a single quadrature are given for the metric components in the general orthogonal perfect fluid case. It is shown that the quadrature can be evaluated in terms of elementary or elliptic integrals when the parameter γ in the equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=(γ−1)ρ takes the values 1, 10/9, 4/3, 14/9, 5/3, 2.


It is shown that complex transformations can be applied on the parameters and coordinates entering a known curvature tensor in order to generate new curvature tensors which, just as the seed tensor, possess the same symmetry properties and satisfy certain algebraic relationships following from the Einstein-Maxwell equations with cosmological constant.
In this paper we extend to the de Sitter universe Bekenstein's result for the minimum variation of the black hole event-horizon area due to the absorption of an extended (classical) particle. Based on these equations we argue that at macroscopic scales the classical and quantum results should be in correspondence with each other (correspondence principle) and conclude that the event-horizon area is quantized in units of Planck's length squared. Consequences are discussed.
In this paper, using a quasi-isotropic from the Kerr metric, we have deduced the equations of motion of a neutral test particle in the gravitational field of a spherical homogeneous rotating body. The perturbation equations of the particle's orbit have also been derived.
Trajectories of test particles in the Ernst space-time are studied. The Poincaré surfaces of section are constructed and Lyapunov characteristic exponents are evaluated for a selected set of trajectories. This approach indicates that the number of isolating integrals is not sufficient to separate equations of motion and the particle trajectories are not integrable.
We consider vacuum space-times (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, g</em>) which are of Petrov type N on an open dense subset of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and which admit (proper) homothetic vector fields with isolated fixed points. We prove that if such is the case then, at the fixed point, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M,g</em>) is flat and the homothetic bivector,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">[a;b]</em> </sub>, is necessarily simple-timelike. Furthermore, we prove that if the homothetic bivector remains simple-timelike in some neighbourhood of the fixed point then, around the fixed point, the space-time in question is a pp-wave. The paper ends with a local characterization and some examples of space-tunes satisfying these conditions.
The Kasner family of vacuum solutions of Einstein's field equations admits a simply-transitive<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>4</sub>, a four-parameter local homothetic group of motions which has an Abelian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>3</sub> subgroup. It is shown that a complex transformation of coordinates and constants exists which maps this family from the normal Kasner form into a form of vacuum metrics whose Weyl tensors are each Petrov type I and which were published in 1932 by Lewis. These metrics also admit a similar<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>4</sub>; however for one particular metric (for one parameter value) the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>4</sub> becomes a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>4</sub> and the resultant metric is one which was rediscovered by Petrov in 1962. These Lewis metrics are thus shown to be Kasner metrics over complex fields. Here they are called<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">windmill</em> metrics because of the rotating relationship between the coordinates and the Killing vector fields admitted. The principal null directions of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">real</em> Kasner and the windmill metrics are discussed; the two families then provide illustrations of two degenerate classes of spacetime metrics whose Weyl tensors are of Petrov type I, as discussed elsewhere by Arianrhod and McIntosh. An extension of the windmill-type generation of metrics to some other families of metrics is also discussed.
The unified set of equations of motion for massive or massless spinning test particles is directly established by using a generalized evolution space formalism over the extended space-time including both Newtonian and Einsteinian universes.
The conditions for the existence of Newtonian analogs of a five dimensional (5D) generalization of the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models in Wesson's gravitational theory are re-analyzed. Contrarily to other claims, we show that classical analogs can be obtained for non-null cosmological constant and negative or null spatial curvature.

A method of calculating the metric from the curvature is presented. Assuming that a tensor with the symmetry properties of a type D curvature tensor is given in an orthonormal tetrad, we use the Bianchi identities and the relationship between the connection and the tetrad in order to calculate, under certain assumptions, the corresponding metric. Some well-known metrics are derived from the curvature by using the method given here.
Using the necessary and sufficient condition of Capovilla, Jacobson and Dell, it is shown that a result of Samuel for gravitational instantons does not extend to 't Hooft's instantons of winding numbers larger than one. A formula for the next instanton satisfying this condition is given.
Time dependent metrics, conformally equivalent to the static spherically symmetric metric, are considered. The one-body problem is investigated and some general conditions for accelerated and geometrically modified orbiting are obtained. The radial and nonradial null geodesics are investigated and it is shown that their differential equations are not modified by the conformal factor.
An important implicit assumption usually made regarding the nature of the cosmos and the theoretical framework employed in its study is that of structural stability. On the basis of the modern results in dynamical systems theory, it has recently been argued that the appropriate theoretical framework might instead turn out to be that of structural fragility. Here we give further examples and review the major results in cosmology to illustrate the potential extent of the relevance of fragility in cosmology.
The concept of the Ötsuki generalized connection is explained using a direct approach based only on the bundle of linear frames of a manifold. Simple derivations of the generalized torsion and curvature forms are given. Covariant differentiation is also derived as a generalization of the classical one. A way to possible further generalizations is indicated.
We prove the existence of new classes of ghost- and tachyon- free gauge-invariant gravity Lagrangians for the spontaneously broken Poincaré, affine, and projective groups, respectively. To do so the formalism of spin-projection semioperators which generalizes the one of the ordinary spin-projection operators has been developed.
The balance problem in general relativity is reviewed. The transformation connecting the Herlt equations for electrovacuum and the Weyl equations for axially symmetric vacuum is given. This yields a new exact solution for the superposition of two separated Reissner-Nordström sources with a balance condition which depends upon their separation distance. This result has potential implications for averting gravitational collapse. Details of the singularity structure are also presented.
We consider de Sitter solutions, relevant for instance in studies of inflation, in cosmologies where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R),<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> being the scalar curvature. Previous investigations have mostly concentrated on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) = R+εR<sup>2</sup> which always has a solution matching the conventional de Sitter one. We show that this circumstance is rather exceptional, and that one must go to higher terms to see signs of the generic behaviour, In general the de Sitter solutions are different from those of Einstein gravity. We present complete solutions for the general cubic Lagrangian. We also address the question of when the solutions to equations from truncated actions can be expected to well represent solutions of some full (and possibly unknown) theory. Such theories provide the possibility of weakening the bounds on the energy density of the inflaton, allowing an easier reconciliation of the inflationary universe with structure-forming topological defects.
A new package in the symbolic algebra system MAPLE is presented for the conversion of complicated spinor equations to their expansions with respect to a normalized spinor dyad. By following a simple index convention, we obtain a powerful computational tool with a straightforward and easy to use syntax. A number of examples, including nontrivial applications of the package to recent research, are provided.
Deformed classical mechanics and gravity is discussed. Infinitesimally deformed quantum field theory is reviewed. Infinitesimally deformed Bose-Einstein distribution is derived. Infinitesimally deformed thermofield dynamics is constructed and applied to a scalar field and string theories.
Using a certain formalism for the stationary axisymmetric problem with source a rigidly rotating perfect fluid it is shown that under specific assumptions, covariantly imposed, the field equations are reduced to a system of two ordinary second order differential equations. Two known metrics are special solutions of this system. In addition two static axisymmetric perfect fluid solutions, with a spherically symmetric limit, are derived explicitly.
The general-relativistic effects of an extreme Reissner-Nordström black hole on the flux of radiation emitted by a hot spot orbiting the hole with a thin accretion disk are investigated. The light curves, the redshift factor, and the solid angle against the spot orbit position are given. The results are then compared with those of a spot orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole.
The existence of an affine vector field in an Einstein-Maxwell space-time is discussed. We first consider the non-null electromagnetic field case, and show that there are no solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations admitting a proper affine collineation. In the case of a null electromagnetic field case, we characterize all the possible solutions with such property.
The entropy upper bound for a charged black hole in equilibrium with thermal radiation is derived by means of a general model-independent approach. This bound in some ways improves that proposed by Bekenstein by taking into account the energy of the electrical field. The corresponding lower bound for the Euclidean action is also obtained. The particular role of black-hole physics in the context under consideration is discussed.
The Klein-Gordon equation is studied in a family of exact solutions of the Einstein equations whose material content is a perfect fluid with stiff equation of state (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=ɛ). The field equations are solved exactly for some members of the family and for massive or massless fields.
It is shown that in the case of a spherical nonstatic fluid distribution undergoing shear-free motion the field equations in higher dimensional space-time can be reduced to a single second-order differential equation involving an arbitrary function of the radial co-ordinate. This result extends to higher dimensions a similar one obtained by Wyman and Faulkes earlier for 4D space-time. Solving this differential equation a number of new solutions is found, and the dynamical behaviour of one of the models is briefly discussed. The ansatz is later generalised to include the electromagnetic field as well.
This paper studies a massive scalar field in a (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+2)-dimensional spherically symmetric space-time with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>n</sub> topology. The Hamilton-Jacobi function is constructed from the Wick-rotated action of the solution of Einstein's field equations by analytic continuation. Solutions are obtained by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the Lorentzian region, and inflation is exhibited.
Physically meaningful solutions of the field equations for static spherical dust distributions in the Einstein-Cartan theory have been obtained. There is one in which the spin is zero at the center and another with zero spin at the boundary of the sphere.
A general scheme to average out an arbitrary 4-dimensional Riemannian space and to construct the geometry of the averaged space is proposed. It is shown that the averaged manifold has a metric and two equi-affine symmetric connections. The geometry of the space is characterized by the tensors of Riemannian and non-Riemannian curvatures, an affine deformation tensor being the result of non-metricity of one of the connections. To average out the differential Bianchi identities, correlation 2-form, 3-form and 4-form are introduced and the differential relations on these correlations tensors are derived, the relations being integrable on an arbitrary averaged manifold. Upon assuming a splitting rule for the average of the product including a covariantly constant tensor, an averaging out of the Einstein equations has been carried out which brings additional terms with the correlation tensors into them. As shown by averaging out the contracted Bianchi identities, the equations of motion for the averaged energy-momentum tensor do also include the geometric correction terms. Considering the gravitational induction tensor to be the Riemannian curvature tensor (then the non-Riemannian one is the macroscopic gravitational field), a theorem that relates the algebraic structure of the averaged microscopic metric with that of the induction tensor is proved. Due to the theorem the same field operator as in the Einstein equations is manifestly extracted from the averaged ones. Physical interpretation and application of the relations and equations obtained to treat macroscopic gravity are discussed.
In this paper, a new coordinate condition in general relativity is proposed. This coordinate condition is just Euler's equations of the harmonic map theory. It is shown that in case of rectangular coordinates our coordinate condition reduces to Fock's harmonic coordinate condition. Using this new coordinate condition the different spherical symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations are discussed. The axisymmetric case is also investigated.
This paper gives a covariant formalism enabling investigation of the possibility of change of signature in classical General Relativity, when the geometry is that of a Robertson-Walker universe. It is shown that such changes are compatible with the Einstein field equations, both in the case of a barotropic fluid and of a scalar field. A criterion is given for when such a change of signature should take place in the scalar field case. Some examples show the kind of resulting exact solutions of the field equations.
We investigate the Oppenheimer-Snyder space-time with a positive cosmological constant A. The interior of the dust sphere is described by the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time while the exterior is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time. Due to the cosmological constant A, when the gravitational mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>o</sub> of the dust sphere is very large, there is no collapsing solution with the de Sitter-like asymptotic region which expands exponentially in the expanding universe frame. This fact suggests that the very large initial inhomogeneity does not necessarily lead to the failure of the cosmic no hair conjecture.
The (2+l)-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations are solved for a perfect fluid source with a positive electric charge distribution and nonzero vorticity. The solution describes the interior region of an extended charged object and is physically reasonable in the sense that the massenergy density and the pressure are both positive throughout the region. An unexpected feature is that the charged fluid produces no electric field in its proper frame of reference, so that the electromagnetic field is purely magnetic.
The equation of the relative strain is analyzed in tetrad form with respect to a family of observers moving on spatially circular orbits, in the Schwarzschild space-time. We select a field of tetrads, which we term phase locking frames, and explicitly calculate how, in the equatorial plane, the orbital acceleration, its gradient and the Fermi drag add together to compensate the curvature and assure equilibrium among a set of comoving neighbouring particles. While equilibrium is achieved in the radial and azimuthal directions, in the direction orthogonal to the equatorial plane there is a residue of acceleration which pulls a particle towards that plane leading to a harmonic oscillation with a frequency equal to the proper frequency of the orbital revolution. This measurement, combined with those of the frequency shift of an incoming photon and the frequency of precession of the local compass of inertia, enables one to determine the relativistic ratio 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M/r</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the gravitational mass of the source and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> the coordinate radius of the circular orbits.
It is demonstrated, in a straightforward approach, that a static black hole has no spinor hair if we assume that the fields vanish at infinity. We extend this to the case of asymptotically covariantly constant spinors (Witten spinors) which approach a constant value at spatial infinity. We show that with the dominant energy condition and in absence of external spinor sources, Witten spinors must vanish everywhere in the region exterior to a stationary black hole with an horizon in an asymptotically flat space-time.
It is a fundamental feature of quantum field theory that correlations between observable quantities occur over all spacetime regions. In particular, in cosmological models with horizons, such correlations will be present in regions which “lie outside of each other's horizon”. Such correlations may play an important role in processes occurring in the early universe.
A homogeneous Bianchi type VI<sub>h</sub> cosmological model filled with perfect fluid, null electromagnetic field and streaming neutrinos is obtained for which the free gravitational field is of the electric type. The barotropic equation of state<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (γ−1)ɛ is imposed in the particular case of Bianchi VI<sub>0</sub> string models. Various physical and kinematical properties of the models are discussed.
A package of programs for writing and checking the solutions to the equations for various types of collineations, written in the symbolic manipulation language REDUCE is presented. Some examples of previously found collineations that have been checked are given, and new results reported.
A non-stationary model of two concentric counter-rotating layers is constructed in (2+1)-dimensional Einstein theory. It is shown that the model which satisfies both the weak and the dominant energy conditions, may evolve from a state with no closed time-like curves to a state where such curves are present in a finite region of space. No singularities are formed in the process.
This work deals with the relativistic, coordinate invariant theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in a nonhomogeneous medium that is spatially isotropic with respect to the generalized 4-velocity. The existence of a new superpotential for the electromagnetic field is established. The governing field equation for the superpotential is derived via a generalized Lorentz gauge condition for the electromagnetic potential and two new tensor identities involving the curvature tensor. The new field equation takes a simple form which reveals the effect of non-rigidity, rotation, acceleration, and incomplete material isotropy with respect to the Fermi frames as well as curvature and nonhomogeneous material properties.
The Einstein-like field equations obtained from the variation of a Lagrangian containing linear, quadratic (Gauss-Bonnet) and quartic terms for a ten-dimensional cosmological model cannot be solved analytically. However, we can reduce them to a system of dynamical equations for the “Hubble parameters”. The study of the mathematical properties of the fixed points of this system gives a qualitative picture of the behaviour of a class of possible solutions. The inclusion of a quartic term generates an extremely rich structure for the corresponding dynamical system. Some solutions are shown to exhibit the interesting property of dimensional reduction, which has been proposed as a possible explanation of the three-dimensional character of our universe.
By the addition of a single point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i∘</em> at space-like infinity, null infinity,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em><sup>+</sup> ⋃<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em><sup>-</sup>, may be regarded as the null cone with vertex<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i∘</em>. We show that, given suitable regularity conditions at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i∘</em>, there exist natural Bondi scalings on the whole of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> which may be used to relate quantities on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em><sup>+</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em><sup>-</sup>. In particular, we show that, in terms of such a scaling, the mass aspect Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>2</sub> <sup>o</sup> </span> on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> satisfies lim<sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>→°</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>∈<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>+ Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>2</sub> <sup>°</sup> </span> = lim<sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>→°</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>∈<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>- Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>2</sub> <sup>°</sup> </span> where the limits are taken along the same generator of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>.

The magnetically charged Reissner-Nordström black hole solutions of Maxwell-Einstein theory cannot evaporate completely, because their Hawking temperature tends to zero as their mass to charge ratio approaches unity. This situation changes when these solutions are considered in the context of a non-Abelian gauge theory containing nonsingular magnetic monopoles. If the horizon is sufficiently small, the Reissner-Nordström solution develops a classical instability and evolves into a new type of magnetically charged black hole solution. The temperature of these new solutions increases monotonically as the horizon contracts, so that there is no obstacle to the complete evaporation of a magnetically charged black hole.
We discuss the theory of non-critical strings with extrinsic curvature embedded in a target space dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> greater than one. We emphasize the analogy between 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> gravity coupled to matter and non self-avoiding liquid-like membranes with bending rigidity. We first outline the exact solution for strings in dimensions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>&lt;1 via the double scaling limit of matrix models and then discuss the difficulties of an extension to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>&gt;1. Evidence from recent and ongoing numerical simulations of dynamically triangulated random surfaces indicate that there is a non-trivial crossover from a crumpled to an extended surface as the bending rigidity is increased. If the cross-over is a true second order phase transition corresponding to a critical point there is the exciting possibility of obtaining a well defined continuum string theory for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>&gt;1.
We propose a classification of an infinite series of the static solutions to the vacuum Einstein equation by means of their soliton number and the real and/or complex pole trajectories. We also show that in the 4-soliton solution there appears an intriguing ring solution of which the curvature invariant has a finite limit at the rings.
A reductive homogeneous space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M=P/G</em> is considered, endowed with an invariant connection, i.e., such that all left translations of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> induced by members of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> preserve it. We study the set of singularities of such connections giving sufficient conditions for it to be empty, or, in other cases, families of b-incomplete curves converging to singularities. A full description of the b-completion of a connection with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>=ℝ<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sup> (or a quotient of it) is given with information on its topology.
A quantization procedure is given for the scalar field on stationary, axisymmetric background spacetimes with orthogonal 2-surfaces. The procedure is based on observers orthogonal to surfaces of constant Killing time, and thus agrees with the usual procedure for static spacetimes. For stationary but nonstatic spacetimes the procedure differs from the usual one but nonetheless leads to a natural quantization scheme. Applying the procedure to flat space in rotating coordinates gives the standard, inertial Minkowski vacuum. For the Kerr spacetime, the procedure yields a particle definition which is well-defined everywhere outside the horizon. The above observers are just nonrotating ZAMO's, and the vacuum state smoothly interpolates between the “in” and “out” Boulware vacua.
The NP and GHP formalisms are reviewed in order to understand and demonstrate the important role played by the commutator equations in the structure of the system of equations in each formalism, and also in the associated integration procedures. Particular attention is focused on how the commutator equations are to be satisfied (or checked for consistency) in each of the formalisms. In particular, it is shown that in Held's integration method in the GHP formalism, it is usually sufficient—alongside the GHP Ricci and Bianchi equations—to apply the GHP commutator equations to two complex, zero-weighted quantities which consist of four real, functionally independent scalars. This result is used, first of all, to suggest an additional step in Held's method, which ensures that there is no possibility of ambiguity in the procedure; secondly a restatement/ modification of Held's integration method is suggested, which enables the integration procedure to be completely self-contained and fully co-ordinate- and gauge-independent. An example of its use for a subclass of Petrov type D vacuum spaces is given.
The properties of an exact spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution obtained in non-comoving coordinates are examined. This solution contains shear, and the pressure and the density are positive in the interior of the fluid. Their respective gradients with respect to comoving radial coordinate are equal and negative, and the speed of sound in this fluid is less than the speed of light in vacuum and is increasing outwards. There is a singularity at the center of the fluid since the pressure and the density become infinite there, though their ratio becomes unity. This singularity is naked, since there does not exist a trapped surface in the fluid outside this singularity. The circumference is an increasing function of radical comoving coordinate, and the mass function is positive and is increasing outwards. There are no tidal forces in radial direction, but the tidal forces normal to this direction are non-vanishing. We also give the kinematic quantities for this fluid. However, it is not possible to match this solution with an exterior vacuum Schwarzschild solution. Moreover, the dominant energy condition produces imaginary values for the sound speed.

Solutions to both the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraint of quantum gravity have been found in the loop representation, which is based on Ashtekar's new variables. While the diffeomorphism constraint is easily solved by considering loop functionals which are knot invariants, there remains the puzzle why several of the known knot invariants are also solutions to the hamiltonian constraint. We show how the Jones polynomial gives rise to an infinite set of solutions to all the constraints of quantum gravity thereby illuminating the structure of the space of solutions and suggesting the existance of a deep connection between quantum gravity and knot theory at a dynamical level.
General Relativity allows for the existence of closed timelike curves. Various attempts have been made to exploit this possibility and build a “time machine,” that is a spacetime that has closed timelike lines inside some compact domain. We examine a simple model of a time machine, and construct the quantum-mechanical propagator for free particles in the vicinity of the causality violating domain. We discover that it is impossible for such propagators to be consistent with the law of conservation of probability. We speculate on the possible deeper consequences of our calculations.
It is established, within a weak-field approximation, that a spherically symmetric solution of Simple Supergravity (with the appropriate conditions on the orbits of the symmetry generators) admits necessarily the additional symmetry of translation in time, thus generalising the Birkhoff theorem of General Relativity.
The cosmological solutions of Brans-Dicke theory for a radiation universe obtained so far are commented on. Some problematic solutions are corrected and the conditions corresponding to singularity-free solutions are investigated.
The generalisation of the Einstein vacuum theory to Ōtsuki geometry is considered. It is shown that the theory based on Lagrangian density √-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gR</em> is consistent and leads to a theory that is classically indistinguishable from the Einstein theory.
We find five-dimensional solutions to the equations of motion developed by Henriques. These equations are associated with the Einstein-Hubert lagrangian as modified in order to model the low-energy limit of some superstring theories. We look at extensions of both Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and Kasner models and find a large variety of behavior for both vacuum and matter-filled cases. In the case of the Kasner extension we find that the generalized Einstein equations do not admit analytic power-law solutions.
We identify the fiber-bundle-with-connection structure that underlies the Lanczos H-tensor formulation of Riemannian geometrical structure. We consider linear connections to be type (1,2) affine tensor fields, and we sketch the structure of the appropriate fiber bundle that is needed to describe the differential geometry of such affine tensors, namely the affine frame bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> with structure group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span> (4) =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GL</em>(4) Ⓢ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>ℝ<sup>4</sup> over spacetime<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. Generalized affine connections on this bundle are in 1-1 correspondence with pairs<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(Γ, K)</em> on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, where the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gl</em>(4)-component<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Γ</em> denotes a linear connection and the T<span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>ℝ<sup>4</sup>-component<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> is a type (1,3) tensor field on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>. We show that the Lanczos H-tensor arises from a gauge fixing condition on this geometrical structure. The resulting translation gauge, the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lanczos gauge</em>, is invariant under the transformations found earlier by Lanczos. The other Lanczos variables<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sub>μm</sub>and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> are constructed in terms of the translational component of the generalized affine connection in the Lanczos gauge. To complete the geometric reformulation we reconstruct the Lanczos Lagrangian completely in terms of affine invariant quantities. The essential field equations derived from our<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span> (4)-invariant Lagrangian are the Bianchi and Bach-Lanczos identities for four-dimensional Riemannian geometry.
We construct a nondiagonalizable solution of the stationary axially symmetric vacuum Einstein equations involving Painlevé transcendents III(V). From the asymptotic behaviour of this solution we identify the corresponding Newtonian potential as that of a modulated line mass at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>=0, and we identify our transcendental solution as corresponding to a very special differentially rotating modulated line source.
For the Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L = R</em><sup>2</sup>,the de Sitter space-time is known to be an attractor solution. Here, we classify for closed Friedmann models in which initial conditions lead asymptotically to a de Sitter phase and what the behaviour is for the other solutions. Four types of solutions form together a generic set, and three of them are asymptotically de Sitter; the fourth one has both an initial and final singularity. Furthermore, exactly seven other solutions exist and can be given in closed form. Three of them are known, the other four are new and have a linear asymptotic behaviour of the cosmic scale factor.
This article concerns an outgoing spherically symmetric light-cone evolving according to the Einstein equations. The relevant equations are solved explicitly as integrals of the Mailing matter, which is unspecified apart from energy conditions and a consistency condition. A condition on the matter is derived which is necessary and sufficient for the cone to be trapped. If the cone is not trapped it is complete, and if it is trapped it will recollapse to a point. In either case, the asymptotic behaviour of the matter is consequently constrained.
There are some polynomial formulations of Einstein's equations in which the metric is allowed to become degenerate. We examine some known exact solutions to see whether they may be smoothly joined to solutions with degenerate metrics. If one uses a lapse function which is a spatial scalar, this is very easy. If the lapse function has a small and negative tensor density weight, the joining together may take place across the horizons in the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions. For large and negative weights, we have been unable to find any examples.

We present in this paper an exact solution of a multipolar stationary object attached to a string embedded in a background gravitational field. Under certain conditions the string may be interpreted as a cosmic string.
An invariant description of the light deflection in a central symmetric static gravitational field is suggested. It is based on the use of the positive space metric, which realizes the notion of infinitesimal distance measured by ideal observers by means of the light ranging. The additional characteristics of deflection (the accumulated deflection) are suggested.
We exhibit Gödel's geometry in terms of a set of gaussian systems of coordinates, the union of which constitutes a complete cover for the whole manifold. We present a mechanism which induces a particle to follow a closed time-like line (CTL) present in this geometry. We generalize the construction of special class of observers (Generalized Milne Observers) which provides a way to define the largest causal domain allowing a standard field theory to be developed.
The program ORTOCARTAN can calculate the curvature tensors (Riemann, Ricci, Einstein and Weyl) from a given orthonormal tetrad representation of the metric tensor. It was first announced in 1981, but since then has undergone several extensions and transplants onto other computers. This article reviews the current status of the program from the point of view of a user. The following topics are discussed: the problems that the program can be applied to, the special features of the algorithms that make the program powerful, the technical requirements to run the program and two simple examples of applications.
One method of gaining some insight into Finsler geomety is that of studying small Finsler perturbations of Riemannian metrics. We consider here the the standard two-dimensional upper half plane Poincaré metric, for which the geodesics are semi-circles and vertical lines. The effect of a simple Finsler perturbation on these geodesics is given by an explicit computation of the perturbed geodesics.
The colliding plane wave problem is considered using an unconventional coordinate system. This permits a complete solution to be explicitly stated for the general case of arbitrary approaching waves with constant and aligned polarization.
In this article we review some recent results obtained in the interplay between field theory in curved space-time and information theory, and explore some consequences. We shall explain how the Weyl tensor becomes responsible for the creation of quantum noise which, in turn, degrades a considerable fraction of the information which is optically transferred in a curved space-time. We conclude that causal connection between spacetime regions, although being a necessary condition for transmitting information between them, is by no means sufficient. This is because this quantum noise might preclude the observation of very distant objects in the Universe and even closer ones if it becomes very intense. We argue that naked singularities are very powerful sources of noise and, therefore, cannot be observed optically. This leads to the intriguing possibility that the ‘no-hair’ theorem might be more general than was thought before.
We review recent developments in differential topology with special concern for their possible significance to physical theories, especially general relativity. In particular we are concerned here with the discovery of the existence of non-standard (“fake” or “exotic”) differentiable structures on topologically simple manifolds such as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>7</sup>, ℝ<sup>4</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>3</sup> X ℝ<sup>1</sup>. Because of the technical difficulties involved in the smooth case, we begin with an easily understood toy example looking at the role which the choice of complex structures plays in the formulation of two-dimensional vacuum electrostatics. We then briefly review the mathematical formalisms involved with differentiable structures on topological manifolds, diffeomorphisms and their significance for physics. We summarize the important work of Milnor, Freedman, Donaldson, and others in developing exotic differentiable structures on well known topological manifolds. Finally, we discuss some of the geometric implications of these results and propose some conjectures on possible physical implications of these new manifolds which have never before been considered as physical models.

With any shear-free congruence of null geodesics in a Lorentzian geometry there is associated a Cauchy-Riemann three-space; and in certain spacetimes including the Ricci-flat spacetimes with expanding null shear-free (n.s.f.) congruences the deviation form of the congruence picks out an integrable distribution of complex two-spaces in the CR geometry. Conversely, given a CR geometry with an integrable distribution of two-spaces one can construct an associated family of spacetimes with a null, shear-free congruence. The interesting problem is the restriction<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>=0. We consider the case of n.s.f. congruences in Minkowski spacetime constructed from CR geometries of maximal symmetry. The special two-spaces are here taken to be those associated with either the Taub-NUT geometry or, as a limiting case, those associated with the Hauser twisting type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> solution. We obtain the most general solution for these cases.
A cosmology described by a Robertson-Walker metric with Lagrangian √-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>(@#@<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R+σR</em><sup>2</sup>) and a massless conformal scalar field as matter content is considered. It is shown that, when the adiabatic regularization is performed, there is, in the spatially flat case, an inflationary solution which is not stable in the future, at first perturbative order, if the condition σ&gt;t<span class="Stack"> <sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>/2160π (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sub>p</sub> Planck time) is fulfilled and stable in the opposite case.
The paper is devoted to the presentation of the new cosmological solutions obtained by the author within the framework of a gauge theory of gravitation. The models are a combination of evolving models and steady-state models.
We study the Bel-Robinson tensor and the velocity field associated with it for the collision of gravitational plane waves. It is shown how this energy tensor provides a rather good physical description of the collision process.
The two well-known solutions of general relativity, the Schwarzschild and the Bertotti-Robinson solutions, are shown to be described by a common metric. In a particular coordinate system we show the connection between this metric and the metric of Reissner-Nordström.
The general structure of a metric-torsion theory of gravitation allows a parity-violating contribution to the complete action which is linear in the curvature tensor and vanishes identically in the absence of torsion. The resulting action involves, apart from the constant ¯<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> </sub>=8π/c<sup>4</sup>, a coupling (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>) which governs the strength of the parity interaction mediated by torsion. In this model the Brans-Dicke scalar field generates the torsion field, even though it has zero spin. The interesting consequence of the theory is that its results for the solar-system differ very little from those obtained from Brans-Dicke (BD) theory. Therefore the theory is indistinguishable from BD theory in solar-system experiments.
The canonical approach to general relativity in terms of reference systems is discussed to show that Einstein's principles of equivalence and general relativity imply the physical insignificance of quantized general relativity. In particular it is demonstrated that even the (anholonomic) flat-space canonical formalism leads to physically uninterpretable results. This lack of quantum content of general relativity is reflected by Rosenfeld's uncertainty relations and can especially be removed by modifying general relativity in the spirit of classical Einstein-Cartan theory with teleparallelism.
Starting from an assumption of homogeneity of matter-energy tensor and Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar field we obtain a Robertson-Walker type of metric form in five-dimensional spacetime with the essential difference that our model is spatially inhomogeneous. The model exhibits an interesting feature in that as we approach the centre of symmetry the compact dimension becomes very large, with the implication that the Kaluza-Klein excitations become very light when located there and that the origin may represent a singular concentration of matter with motion in the extra dimension. Following Wesson the effective 4D properties of matter from the 5D vacuum solutions are also briefly discussed. Assuming particular functional relationships between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> as also between the scale factor and scalar field, we obtain exact solutions which may be of relevance to the early universe and its extended inflation in the BD type of theory. We also discuss very briefly rollover time immediately after tunneling to the true vacuum state to explore if dimensionality has any marked influence on the situation.

The dynamics of the production of relative high frequency gravitational waves by astrophysical events taking place within the galaxies in the cosmological context can be well represented by a phenomenological description of the generating processes through a “radiation energy profile” that contains two adjustable parameters. This profile gives a relation between the total pressure and energy density of the matter generating gravitational radiation together with the “waves” themselves, both treated as ordinary hydrodynamic fluids. The resulting cosmological models then represent, in a descriptive way only, universes filled with two interacting fluids: on the one hand gravitational radiation, and the matter which emits it but does not reabsorb it, on the other. It is shown that the dynamic effects of the model can be significant, even if the conversion rate of matter into gravitational radiation is relatively small.
A general solution of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations has been obtained for a static charged gas sphere having maximum matter density at the centre. The density decreases along the radius and finally becomes zero at the surface of the sphere.
The most general Lagrangian for dynamical torsion theory quadratic in curvature and torsion is considered. We impose two simple and physically reasonable constraints on the solutions of the equations of motion (i) there must be solutions with zero curvature and nontrivial torsion and (ii) there must be solutions with zero torsion and non covariantly constant curvature. The constraints reduce the number of independent coupling constants from ten to five. The resulting theory contains Einstein's general relativity and Weitzenböck's absolute parallelism theory as the two sectors.
In a world with varying particle masses, clocks become asynchronous and metersticks inconsistent. By combining two or more clocks with different known dependences on mass, we can construct a nearly invariant clock, and measure the rate of mass variation.
The superimposed gravitational field of a string and a family of axisymmetric walls is analysed. The resulting axisyrnmetric system is a topological defect. A striking observational feature is the appearance of a double-ring image from a distant point source.
We describe an algorithm for solving 1 + 1-systems that are in symmetric hyperbolic form. It is applied to spherically symmetric deviations from a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 0, radiation filled Isotropic universe. We compare the solution to the full Einstein equations with those of the linearized equations. For small enough initial data the evolutions are indistinguishable. However, for large data, i.e., for initial density contrasts in the 1 percent range, trapped surfaces appear and singularities form.
The concepts of fragility and rigidity in theories containing a minimally coupled, self-interacting scalar field are introduced and defined for an arbitrary space-time dimension,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>, by using the field as the dynamical variable. It is proved that inflation is rigid and the case of an exponential self-interaction is studied. The fragility of higher-order, scalar-tensor and Kaluza-Klein gravity theories is investigated by using their conformal equivalence to general relativity plus a scalar field. Whilst most higher-order theories are rigid, the conditions for Kaluza-Klein theories to become fragile depend strongly on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>.
A mechanism is presented for obtaining exact solutions of the Einstein equations for hypersurface-homogeneous scalar fields which unifies and generalizes recent results for inflaton fields in the spatially homogeneous case and for thick domain walls in the timelike-homogeneous case.
A theorem is proved which shows that under a certain condition called the strong null convergence condition the topological structure of the Cauchy horizons of the type occurring in the Reissner-Nordström and Kerr space-times will have to change. This result together with an earlier argument due to Tipler shows that such horizons are unstable.
It was found many<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">years</em> ago that in cylindrical polar coordinates the energy and momentum densities of gravitational waves, calculated with the help of a pseudo-tensor, vanish. However, using cartesian coordinates, one finds them to be finite and reasonable.



The relativistic interior dynamics of a spherically symmetric, non rotating star composed of an elastic material is analyzed. A suitable formulation of relativistic elasticity is used, and the corresponding second order Einstein equations are found. The equations arise naturally in a non-comoving frame and reduce, in the static case, to the “generalized” Tohnan-Oppenheimer-Volkhoff equations considered by J. Kijowski and the author in a previous paper. The charged case is also discussed.
The first order formalism is applied to study the field equations of a general Lagrangian density for gravity of the form<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathcal{L}_G = \sqrt { - g} f(R)\)</span>. These field equations correspond to theories which are a subclass of conformally metric theories in which the derivative of the metric is proportional to the metric by a Weyl vector field. The resulting geometrical structure is unique, except when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)=aR</em><sup>2</sup>, in the sense that the Weyl field is identifiable in terms of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and its derivatives. In the case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)=aR</em><sup>2</sup> the metric is only defined up to a conformai factor. We discuss the matter conservation equations which are implied by the invariance of the theories under diffeomorphisms. We apply the results to the case of dust and obtain that in general the dust particles will not follow geodesic Unes. We consider the linearized field equations and apply them to obtain the weak field slow motion limit. It is found that the gravitational potential acquires a new term which depends linearly on the mass density. The importance of these new equations is briefly discussed.
In this work we propose a lagrangian for spinning fluids in the Einstein-Cartan theory. The basic characteristic of the model is to consider each infinitesimal volume element as replicas of micro-rigid bodies. The theory obtained represents the thermodynamical equilibrium limit of a more general situation where dissipative processes due to spin take place. We outline the extension of such processes to the Einstein-Cartan theory.
A BRST treatment of translational symmetry on flat manifolds, where torsion does not vanish, displays well-known features of differential geometry. In particular the covariant exterior derivative operator is identified as the BRST operator corresponding to translational symmetry. Its nilpotency is due to vanishing curvature on the manifold.
We investigate Brans-Dicke vacuum solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant A from the point of view of dynamical system theory. Assuming a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric we plot the phase diagrams corresponding to all values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>. The analysis of the diagrams allows us to determine several physical properties of the solutions as well as their global dynamical behaviour.
We investigate the propagation and the stability borders of density and metric perturbations on a cosmological background in linear perturbation theory in deDonder-gauge. We obtain the algebraic equations for the generally time-dependent stability borders by setting the typical time for perturbation contrasts infinite in the set of differential equations, while all other typical times stay finite. In dD-gauge there are in general three stability borders whereas in synchronous gauge there is only one. In the limiting cases of radiation perturbations and “dustlike” perturbations we obtain in deDonder-gauge no stability border resp. only one stability border (the ordinary Jeans limit). The first case is in contrast to the synchronous gauge and means that radiation perturbations cannot become unstable. During the recombination there could be three stability borders. We classify the propagation solutions and the systems of differential equations governing them by comparing the characteristic times in the original general system of differential equations, in deDonder-gauge and synchronous gauge. The greatest differences for the propagation of density contrasts arise from the presence of a gravitational wave time scale in deDonder-gauge. This becomes significant if the density perturbations are relativistic with respect to the velocity of sound. Gravitational retardation effects are the origin of the 6-dimensionality of the solution space for density contrasts. This reflects the necessity and physical meaning of gauge solutions.


The curvature properties of the real one-solitonic perturbations on a Bianchi II background found by Belinskii and Francaviglia are studied. The conjectured “singularity” at spatial infinity is shown to be a pure coordinate effect. New coordinates are introduced that remove some false infinities on the light-cone. A null-fluid shock wave is found to propagate along the light-cone.
Using the Ma interpretation of 5D Wesson gravity, we construct the corresponding Weyl equation in a quasistatic spherically symmetric gravitational background in order to look at the mass term predicted by the theory. We find that the value of this mass depends strongly on the boundary conditions selected for the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g55</em>. As an example we calculate its value at the surface of the earth.
Recently Berman and Gomide have presented cosmological models with a constant deceleration parameter in general relativity without assuming a specific equation of state. It is shown that these models are equivalent to those with bulk viscosity. Some general remarks are made on the former models, including implications for violations of causality.
We derive Ernst potentials for vacuum Bianchi I through VII models. A scheme to find inhomogeneous generalizations of such models by using generating techniques which incorporate electromagnetic fields or gravitational wave perturbations to a “seed” Bianchi solution is presented.
The horizon problem is studied in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FEW) models. The exact condition for which an observer does not have the horizon problem for a hypersurface<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = constant is derived first in terms of the redshift, then in terms of the temperature which is an observer-independent parameter. It is shown that there are no values of the deceleration parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sub>o</sub> that solve the problem for the recombination hypersurface, while the usual approximated way to investigate this problem leads to a very small positive value of qo — Moreover, the temperature parameter allows us to show when the horizon problem arises and afterwards increases with time. Not being restricted to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) case, its evolution ought to be considered when searching for a possible solution.
Finsler geometries give natural generalisations of Riemannian geometries, and hence possible natural extensions of general relativity. In this latter (gravitational) context, it is of particular interest to find the general spherically symmetric Finsler metric on ℝ<sup>4</sup>. In this paper, we derive this metric. The general solution is given in two alternative forms, the second of which allows easy comparison with Riemannian-like metrics. We also derive the general axially symmetric Finsler metric on ℝ<sup>4</sup>.
We investigate the possible shapes of the surface of a rigidly rotating perfect fluid on which is matched the Kerr metric, using the Boyer (1965) surface condition. The solution, given in Figures 1 to 5, depends on three parameters,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β = qK, q = a/m, η-</em> (a/gwc), where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> denotes the mass of the source, a its angular momentum per unit mass, ω the angular velocity of rotation, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> is an integration constant appearing in Boyer's surface condition. When β &lt; 1, as in Figures 1 to 3, there are, for given<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em>, two possible surfaces, of which the smaller one touches the ring-singularity at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ = a, z</em> = 0. When<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β &gt; 1</em>, as in Figures 4 and 5, there is only one possible surface of kidney-shaped tori, which also touch the ring singularity. In the case of a differentially rotating perfect fluid, we find a variety of possible strictly spheroidal surfaces, depending on the choice of an arbitrary integration function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em>(Ω) of the angular velocity Ω. If we choose<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em>(Ω) so that, at each point on the surface, Ω is single-valued, then the resulting Ω distribution exhibits an equatorial acceleration, similar to what is observed on the surface of the sun. This angular velocity distribution turns out to be identical with Thorne's (1971) “angular velocity of cumulative dragging”.
We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions that a timelike congruence has to satisfy to admit three independent adapted harmonic coordinates of space, proving in the process that if it does then these coordinates are unique up to a linear transformation with constant coefficients. As a particular example we prove that irrotational pure Born (i.e. not Killing) congruences never admit a system of adapted harmonic coordinates of space.
The conformai Killing equations in resolved form and their first and second integrability conditions are obtained in the compact spin coefficient formalism for arbitrary spacetimes. To facilitate calculations an operator<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> is introduced which agrees with the Lie derivative only when operating on quantities with GHP weights (0,0). The resulting equations are used to find the conditions for the existence of a two dimensional non-Abelian group of homothetic motions in a twisting type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> vacuum spacetime. The equivalence of two such sets of metrics is established, metrics that were recently the subject of independent investigations by Herlt on the one hand and by Ludwig and Yu on the other.
In a framework with metric and spin affine connection as independent field variables, we show that the total energy of a generic<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R + T</em><sup>2</sup>theory of gravitation is positive definite for an asymptotically flat space-time. This suggests that a more thorough treatment of the perturbative quantization of quadratic theories of gravity (including curvature and torsion squared terms) does not yield violation of unitarity.
We construct a theory of cohomological gravity in arbitrary dimensions based upon a local vector supersyrnmetry algebra. The observables in this theory are polynomial, but generally non-local operators, and have a natural interpretation in terms of a universal bundle for gravity. As such, their correlation functions correspond to cohomology classes on moduli spaces of Riemannian connections. In this uniformization approach different moduli spaces are obtained by introducing curvature singularities on codimension two submanifolds via a puncture operator. This puncture operator is constructed from a naturally occurring differential form of co-degree two in the theory, and we are led to speculate on connections between this continuum quantum field theory, and the discrete Regge calculus.
By averaging out Cartan's structure equations for a four-dimensional Riemannian space over space regions, the structure equations for the averaged space have been derived with the procedure being valid on an arbitrary Riemannian space. The averaged space is characterized by a metric, Riemannian and non-Rimannian curvature 2-forms, and correlation 2-, 3- and 4-forms, an affine deformation 1-form being due to the non-metricity of one of two connection 1-forms. Using the procedure for the space-time averaging of the Einstein equations produces the averaged ones with the terms of geometric correction by the correlation tensors. The equations of motion for averaged energy momentum, obtained by averaging out the contracted Bianchi identities, also include such terms. Considering the gravitational induction tensor to be the Riemannian curvature tensor (the non-Riemannian one is then the field tensor), a theorem is proved which relates the algebraic structure of the averaged microscopic metric to that of the induction tensor. It is shown that the averaged Einstein equations can be put in the form of the Einstein equations with the conserved macroscopic energy-momentum tensor of a definite structure including the correlation functions. By using the high-frequency approximation of Isaacson with second-order correction to the microscopic metric, the self-consistency and compatibility of the equations and relations obtained are shown. Macrovacuum turns out to be Ricci non-flat, the macrovacuum source being defined in terms of the correlation functions. In the high-frequency limit the equations are shown to become Isaacson's ones with the macrovauum source becoming Isaacson's stress tensor for gravitational waves.
We show that even though particles with dynamically generated masses do not have the standard point test particle energy-momentum tensor associated with them, their motion in an external gravitational field is nonetheless geodesic. We discuss dynamically massive conformal perfect fluids and construct conformal invariant particle trajectories for them, and show that such fluids behave just like standard kinematically massive perfect fluids in the particular conformal gauge in which the symmetry breaking field is taken to have a constant, spacetime independent vacuum expectation value.
From the equation of continuity, an equation is derived for the change in the spectrum of radiation stationary in a static gravitational field, as measured by local observers in their proper frame. It is shown that an isotropic solution always exists in which the energy density per unit frequency interval is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em><sup>3</sup> times an arbitrary function of<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(g_{00^{\omega 2} } \)</span>.
In this paper we discuss how information transferred optically through a gravitational field is degraded as the quanta interact with the madium (vacuum state). We quantify information by means of Shannon's entropy, and consider information carriers that are quanta of some field. Next, we obtain the quantum noise (‘quantum fog’) produced by the gravitational field and derive the appropriate ‘channel capacity’ formula, which quantifies the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted per pulse, in the face of this noise. We show that the channel capacity formula vanishes if the source of information is a space-time singularity because a very intense noise is produced in the vicinity of the singularity. In other words, space-time singularities are hidden behind a very intense ‘quantum fog’ and cannot be optically observed. A second consequence is that information is degraded as anisotropies (lumpiness) develop in the universe.



The purpose of this review is to describe in some detail the mathematical relationship between geometrodynamics and connection dynamics in the context of the classical theories of 2+1 and 3+1 gravity. We analyze the standard Einstein-Hilbert theory (in any spacetime dimension), the Palatini and Chern-Simons theories in 2+1 dimensions, and the Palatini and self-dual theories in 3+1 dimensions. We also couple varions matter fields to these theories and briefly describe a pure spin-connection formulation of 3+1 gravity. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion from an action principle and perform a Legendre transform to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation of each theory. Since constraints are present in all these theories, we construct constraint functions and analyze their Poisson bracket algebra. We demonstrate, whenever possible, equivalences between the theories.
Solutions are presented for a scalar field coupled conformally to Einstein gravity with a nonvanishing cosmological constant, in the case that the spacetime metric is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. Since the cosmological constant destroys the conformal invariance of the action, these solutions cannot be obtained by solving the flat space wave equation for the scalar field. It turns out that the metric is determined entirely by the cosmological constant, while the scalar field acquires an apparent mass squared which is proportional to the cosmological constant. It is conjectured that the cosmological constant in the universe at present may thus be disguised as the mass of some scalar field.


Self-similar symmetry in relativity generalizes the notion of similarity of classical hydrodynamics. This symmetry is more general than homothetic Killing symmetry and conformal Killing symmetry. This paper presents a simple covariant characterization of self-similarity, for the case of spherical distributions of matter. The matter is represented by a general viscous fluid with non-vanishing shear and no heat conduction. The characterization applies to self-similarity of the type one as well as of type two, and extends previous reaults in the literature. The shear-free case is also discussed.
We show that the electrically charged wormhole soliton solution of sourceless five-dimensional general relativity is classically stable against radial perturbations, except in the special case of a massless soliton.
Drawing on recent developments in the matrix model approach to string theory and the causal set program for quantum gravity we address the question of the origin of time as one aspect of the phase transition from a topological quantum field theory to a quantum theory of gravity. We construct a model with two phases which can be interpreted as containing clocks which either do not tick or tick exactly once. This demonstrates that while a theory based on causal sets may appear to have inherent notions of time and causality, the existence of a phase transition means, that as Saint Augustine wrote in his<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Confessions</em>, “the ‘time’, if such we may call it, when there was no time was not time at all.
We have determined the first and second order radial and time symmetric variations of the mass-energy of spherically symmetric isentropic perfect fluids in the framework of the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation. The results are then used to study the conditions for the total mass-energy to be a minimum under variations which conserve the total number of baryons of the system, and these conditions are interpreted as necessary for the dynamical stability of static configurations subjected to the above perturbations. The post-Newtonian approximation is performed, and we obtain a stability criterion in the Chandrasekhar form,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\bar \gamma \)</span> &gt; 4/3 + 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sub>st</sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GM/R</em>) ≡ υ<sub>c</sub>, υ → 4/3, where<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\bar \gamma \)</span> is the pressure averaged adiabatic index,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> are the total mass and the radius of the configuration respectively, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sub>st</sub> is a constant that depends on the density distribution, the scalar field,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em>, coupling function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ø</em>), and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dω/dø</em>. The value of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sub>st</sub>, is compared to that in Einstein's general relativity and in the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. This is done for the specific scalar-tensor theories of Barker, Schwinger, and for models with curvature coupling.
It is shown that physical quantities in the 4D world such as density and pressure, and an equation of state for a gravitating spherically symmetric fluid, are given by the geometrical property of the fifth dimension of a spherically symmetric line-element in Wesson's 5D theory of gravity.
We consider the generic condition for vectors—both null and non-null—at a fixed point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> of a spacetime, and ask just how generic this condition is. In a general spacetime, if the curvature is not zero at the point<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>, then the generic condition is found to be generic in the mathematical sense that it holds on an open dense set of vectors at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>; more specifically, if there are as many as five non-null vectors in general position at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> which fail to satisfy the generic condition, then the curvature vanishes at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>. If the Riemann tensor is restricted to special forms, then stronger statements hold: An Einstein spacetime with three linearly independent nongeneric timelike vectors at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> is flat at<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>. A Petrov type D spacetime may not have any nongeneric timelike vectors except possibly those lying in the plane of the two principal null directions; if any of the non-null vectors in such a plane are nongeneric, then so are all the vectors of that plane, as well as the plane orthogonal to it.
We consider the generic condition for null directions at a fixed point. A nongeneric vector is one which violates the generic condition: a vector<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> is nongeneric if<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sup>c</sup>X<sup>d</sup> X[<sub>a</sub>R<sub>b</sub>]cd[<sub>e</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><sub>f</sub>] = 0. The presence of null nongeneric vectors at a point can force the curvature tensor to be uniform, i.e., be that of a constant-curvature space; in particular, if there are 11 null nongeneric directions generically situated, then the curvature is uniform. For non-uniform curvature, the locus of nongeneric null directions must obey a cubic relation; examples show that it need not obey a linear relation.
By considering an uncharged mass embedded in an external electromagnetic field we show that the Einstein corrections to the Newtonian results may further be modified.
The general solution to the semiclassical backreaction equation is found for conformally invariant free quantum fields in spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic spacetime with Cosmological constant and with no classical source when the ratio of the renormalisation parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β/α</em>=9/4. It contains a two-parameter family of bouncing solutions that avoid the singularity. There are several one-parameter families which do not have particle horizons. The stability of these solutions is investigated and it is found that they are stable when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> have different signs. However, when both parameters have the same sign the set of stable solutions is restricted by the condition 0 &lt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> &lt; 1/9. In both cases these solutions have a final de Sitter stage.
We obtain all possible representations of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that may arise from the development of the first-order formalism for the quantization of gravity. They are the usual one, the modified extrinsic curvature representation and the intrisic and extrinsic time representations, which arise naturally in this formalism. We show that in the intrinsic time representation the factor-ordering problem is restricted to the pair consisting of the determinant of the metric of the spacelike hypersurfaces and its canonical momentum. Contrary to what was suggested in an earlier paper, no new representations can be obtained in this formalism or by considering actions differing by a total divergence.
Several authors, e.g., Kerr and Debney (1970), Lun (1978), have obtained several<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">II</em> algebraically special vacuum solutions. No<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">II</em> algebraically general vacuum solutions in explicit form have been found before. In this paper, we start from a system of first order partial differential equations, obtained by using a triad formalism, which determines twistfree vacuum metrics with a spacelike Killing vector. The method of group-invariant solutions is then used and a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">2</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">II</em> algebraically general twistfree vacuum solution is obtained. The solution also admits a homothetic Killing vector and is non-geodesic. It is believed to be new. The following explicit solutions are also obtained: (1) A Petrov type II with a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>1</sub>-group of motions solution which belongs to Kundt's class. (2) A Petrov type III,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub>3</sub> Robinson-Trautman solution. All these solutions are known.
We compare, in both<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=3 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=4, two vielbein canonical formulations of gravity: that of Deser and Isham which starts with the metric replaced by vielbeins in the ADM action, and that starting directly from first order vielbein action, and compute the functional that generates the canonical transformation between these two formulations. In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=3, the generator thus exhibits the inherent simplicity of the Einstein action, starting from the DI form (which is as complicated as in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=4). In<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=4, however, the same procedure, while leads to a somewhat different formulation from the existing ones, does not result in miraculous simplifications.
The empty space field equations are investigated for each of the canonical forms obtained previously for the metrics of space-times admitting a surface generating Killing pair, one member of which is hypersurface orthogonal. It is found that the rational first integral of the geodesic equation, corresponding to the Killing pair, is always necessarily the ration of two linear first integrals.
Stationary frames in the Kerr geometry are rewieved and their properties compared. In particular, the locally non-rotating frame, the Carter frame, the static frame and the frame connected with the equatorial circular geodesic are treated as the most important examples.
An inhomogeneous cosmological model with massive strings as source term is developed in a Kaluza-Klein type of spacetime where the usual space exhibits spherical symmetry and the extra dimension is taken in the form of a circle. When an arbitrary constant in our solution vanishes we get an inhomogeneous cosmological model for pure dust, which further reduces to some particular forms of well known homogeneous models under suitable adjustment of arbitrary constants. The dynamical behaviour of the model is studied and it is found that the extra space admits of dimensional reduction via the successive appearances of one minimum and one maximum throughout its evolution.


The temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background may be partially the imprint left by gravitational waves. Measuring the gravitational wave component and spectral shape of the anisotropy is a critical test of inflationary cosmology and theories of large-scale structure formation.
A new method of detecting torsion in the case of massive electrodynamics is proposed. The method is based on the study of spectral lines of hydrogen-like atoms placed in a torsion field, where the interaction energy between the torsion vector field Q and an electric dipole is given by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> ∼ P · Q. All the methods designed so far have been based on spinning test particles interacting with magnetic fields in which the energy splitting is given by<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> ∼ S · B on a Stern-Gerlach type experiment. We arrive at an energy splitting of order of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ε</em> ∼ 10<sup>−21</sup>erg ∼ 10<sup>−9</sup>eV, which is within the frequency band of radio waves.
We show that if a scalar field similar to the one mediating inflation is effective even now, then the Robertson-Walker model may have some interesting properties under certain conditions. In this case even a spatially closed universe may expand forever. A dust universe has always<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>=1/2 for all values of spatial curvature. The critical density is also less than in the standard Robertson-Walker model.
We obtained the local effective actions for (1,0) and (0,1) supergravity. They were shown to be equivalent to the non-local supergravity actions.
The energy conditions of general relativity are satisfied by all experimentally detected fields. We discuss their interpretation and application to charged spheres. It is found that they prevent the existence of naked singularities, and demand that the effective gravitational mass be everywhere non-negative. We focus on the emergence of limiting configurations-sources of the Reissner-Nordström field that have vanishing effective mass everywhere within the sphere. These configurations have a number of interesting features. Among them we find that, near the center, the limiting form of the equation of state is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>+3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>=0. Notably this is the only equation of state consistent with the existence of zero-point electromagnetic field, and it has been considered in different contexts, in discussions of cosmic strings and in derivations of (3+1) properties of matter from (4+1) geometry. The consistency of these configurations with the Einstein-Maxwell equations is shown by means of explicit examples. These configurations can be interpreted as due to selfinteracting gravitational effects of the zero-point electromagnetic field.
This paper gives a generalisation of Einstein's vacuum field equations for Finsler metrics. The given generalised field equation reproduces the Einstein equations for Riemannian metrics, and also admits non-Riemannian solutions. This is shown in detail by deriving a first order Finsler perturbation, solving the new field equation, of the Schwarzschild metric. This perturbation turns out to be time independent. The effects of the perturbation on the three Classical Tests of General Relativity are derived, and used to give limits on the size of the perturbation parameter involved.
We investigate Bianchi VI<sub>0</sub> cosmological models containing two interacting scalar fields. These models are derived from a dimensional reduction of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=2,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>=5 supergravity theory. Exact solutions are found and the existence of singularities for them is considered.
The exact static and spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's field equations for a massive point-particle with a scalar point-charge as source of a massless scalar field is derived in Schwarzschild coordinates. There exists no longer a Schwarzschild horizon. Only at the point-particle metric and scalar field are singular (naked singularity).

A perturbation wave solution of the Robinson-Trautman equations is proved to be a perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole which describes an outgoing axial gravitational wave and corresponds to a special case of Chandrasekhar's algebraically special perturbation of the Schwarzschild metric.
The Newtonian limit of solutions of a model problem is studied. It is shown that under certain assumptions on the initial data relativistic solutions approach a Newtonian solution as the speed of light tends to infinity. The model problem, although having a much simpler structure than the “real” equations, shows many of the typical problems arising in the discussion of the Newtonian limit. The method of characteristics is applied and its limitation discussed.


This essay reviews recent developments in the theory of Hawking evaporation of black holes. Study of near extremal magnetically charged black holes using a two plus four dimensional effective field theory has led to the concept of horned particles or<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cornucopion</em> as the endpoint of Hawking evaporation. Horned particles are geometries containing two large asymptotic regions connected by microscopic necks. They look like point particles to an observer in any given asymptotic region, but in many ways behave like macroscopic objects. In particular, it is very difficult to pair produce them in external fields and their contribution to virtual loops is highly suppressed. They can serve as the remnants necessary to account for the information apparently lost in Hawking evaporation. The information simply goes into the new asymptotic region formed when the black hole collapses and evaporates.
The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) provides the fundamental basis for any metric theory of gravity, such as general relativity. It implies that the only observable effects of gravitation are those mediated by the spacetime metric. Therefore, at the origin of a local freely falling frame there should be no observable effects of gravity. Null redshift tests provide an interesting way to test this prediction. In this test, the frequencies of two oscillators of a different type are compared at the same location in a gravitational field as the field is varied. Any variation in the frequency would signal a violation of the EEP. Here we shall propose a new test of the EEP called a null phase-delay experiment, in which the phase-delay of a signal propagated over a coil of optical fiber is monitored as the gravitational field at the coil is varied. An interesting test of the EEP in the solar gravitational field can be performed in the laboratory under carefully controlled conditions. With presently available technology, such an experiment could provide a 0.01% test.
This is a translation from German of an article originally published in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Proceedings of the Mathematical-Natural Science Section</em> of the Mainz Academy of Science and Literature, Nr. 11, 1961 (pp. 792–837) (printed by Franz Steiner and Co, Wiesbaden), which is Paper IV in the series “Exact Solutions of the Field Equations of General Relativity Theory” by Pascual Jordan, Jürgen Ehlers, Wolfgang Kundt and Rainer K. Sachs. The translation has been carried out by G. F. R. Ellis (Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Cape Town), assisted by P. K. S. Dunsby, so that this outstanding review paper can be readily accessible to workers in the field today. As far as possible, the translation has preserved both the spirit and the form of the original paper. Despite its age, it remains one of the best reviews available in this area.
A new approach to the back reaction of Hawking radiation on a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH), based on thermodynamics, is proposed, in which the thermodynamical system composed of SBH and thermal radiation in curved space is treated as a thermodynamical system composed of SBH, thermal radiation and a two-dimensional thermodynamical membrane (i.e. event horizon) in flat space.
The equilibrium problem for an axially symmetric, uniformly rotating, elastic solid neutron star is considered within the framework of a new formulation of relativistic elasticity. The analysis is fully relativistic and free of any assumption about the existence of a globally relaxed state of the star. Static configurations may exist only for rigid motions, and for such motions a set of six Einstein equations for six variables is proposed. Due both to the importance of elastic-solid lattices for the structure of neutron stars crusts and to the lack, up to now, of satisfactory axially symmetric perfect fluid interior solutions matching an asimpotically flat exterior, the results seem to indicate the possibility of constructing physically valid models of axially symmetric astrophysical objects in general relativity. The particular case of non-rotating axially symmetric elastic sources is also discussed.
Motivated by the possibility of applying the Killing vector fields of the Jacobi metric for a particular spacetime-matter configuration to generate new solutions by continuous 1-parameter point transformations, we examine the associated Jacobi metric for the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2)-EYM field as given by Bartnik and McKinnon to see if internal symmetries of this kind exist. However, the only solution of the Killing equations we find is ξ<sup>a</sup>=0. In addition we mention more general symmetry properties of the Jacobi metric.
We investigate the limit of Brans-Dicke spacetimes<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> → ∞ applying a coordinate-free technique. We obtain the limits of some known exact solutions. It is shown that these limits may not correspond to similar solutions in the general relativity theory.

We discuss the formation of black holes during the very early stages of a universe in which the gravitational ‘constant’ evolves with time. We argue that black holes will retain ‘memory’ of the value of the gravitational ‘constant’,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, at the time of their formation. Their horizon size and their thermal characteristics are determined by the value of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> when they form, not by the value we measure in the external universe today. The observational effects of primordial black hole explosions are therefore radically altered.
We discuss the possibility that the issue of spacetime singularities in general relativity is solved by their stringy extensions.
The two-dimensional black hole provides a theoretical laboratory in which the quantum nature of black holes may be probed without the complications of four-dimensional dynamics. It is therefore natural to ask, what have we learned from this model? Much recent work has focused on the semi-classical limit where the black hole is similar to the Schwarzschild solution. However, in this essay, we demonstrate that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exact</em> two-dimensional quantum black hole is non-singular. Instead the singularity is replaced by a surface of time reflection symmetry in an extended space-time. The maximally extended space-time thus consists of an infinite sequence of asymptotically flat regions connected by timelike wormholes, rather analogous to the Reissner-Nordström space-time. The implications of this to the apparent loss of quantum information arising from black hole evaporation are also briefly discussed.
Algorithms for the symbolic computation of the NP spin coefficients and curvature components for a given null coframe based on the structural equations of Cartan and the complex vectorial formalism of Debever are described. The efficiency of the algorithms is compared theoretically and also empirically in a number of test cases using implementations in the computer algebra system Maple. The test results confirm the theoretical superiority of the algorithm based on Debever's formalism over the one based directly on Cartan's first structural equations for the computation of the spin coefficients both with respect to execution time and storage requirements. The algorithm for the computation of the curvature components based on Debever's formalism is generally superior to the one based on Cartan's second structural equations but the advantage is not as marked as for the spin coefficients.
The effect of bulk viscosity on the evolution of the Friedmann models is investigated in the context of open thermodynamic systems, which allows for particle creation. It is seen that, by choosing an appropriate function,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>), for the particle creation, all the models presented exhibit inflationary expansion and a non-singular beginning.
It is shown that according to the Kaluza-Klein theory the electromagnetic scalar potential is equal to the angular velocity of the rotational inertial dragging effect in five-dimensional space-time. The gravitational vacuum field equations for a five-dimensional space-time outside a rotating cylindrical shell are solved. The angular velocity of the inertial dragging field outside the shell is determined in terms of the angular momentum of the shell by means of Israel's geometric description of surface layers in general relativity. Projecting the solution into four-dimensional space-time, the inertial dragging field due to the rotation of the shell is interpreted as an electrical field. We conjecture that according to the Kaluza-Klein theory all electromagnetic phenomena are four-dimensional manifestations of the five-dimensional inertial dragging effect.
A Bianchi V model, in the presence of a fluid with shear and rotation, is investigated. Asymptotic solutions are worked out, showing that shear and rotation may give rise to a conflict with present day observations, a problem that can be solved with the help of an inflationary solution.
Interior solutions of Einstein field equations for anisotropic spheres with variable energy density are obtained. The solutions for uniform energy density [10] and for radial pressure equal to zero [11] are particular cases of the present solution. With this solution we are also able to discuss an anisotropic gas sphere. Physically it explains larger red-shifts of different quasi-stellar objects. The results of the model have been used to explain the behaviour of a neutron stars and conclude that the maximum mass of a neutron star does not exceed two solar masses, which confirms the Chandrasekhar limit.
The Dirac spinors and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> matrices are used in combination with the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism in order to obtain yet another formulation of Hamiltonian general relativity, together with a new form of the Gauss-Codazzi equations. The relation with Ashtekar's variables is analyzed; it is shown, for instance, that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> matrices are equivalent to the “electric” field variable. The “electric” and “magnetic” decomposition of the gravitational field is also studie using Dirac matrices.
We consider a two-parameter family of equations of state for perfect fluids which forms the limiting case of a condition employed in a uniqueness proof of static, asymptotically flat solutions of the field equations. We find a geometric interpretation of this family and determine, for each of its members, the one-parameter family of regular spherically symmetric solutions.
In this essay, we review first Mach's Principle and then the notion of an isotropic singularity. We give evidence to support a formulation of the cosmological part of Mach's Principle as the requirement that the initial singularity of space-time is an isotropic singularity, and we suggest that Mach's Principle may become a ‘theorem’ of quantum gravity.



The Gutsunaev-Manko static vacuum metric is presented in explicit form.
The intensity of the wave function of a quantum particle is shown to undergo a spatial oscillation due to the influence of a quantum superposition of space-time geometries in a simply connected region, even though each geometry is flat in this region.
We study some consequences of the generalized Maxwell-Einstein system in higher dimensions. This generalization is such that the Maxwell-type field constructed in an even<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional space-time preserves the conformal invariance. After dimensional reduction to four dimensions, it gives rise to scalar, electromagnetic and Kalb-Ramond fields. Specifically, we analyse here some compactification processes, including the stability of the final configuration (for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=8), and anisotropic cosmological solutions (for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=6).
Quantum field theory in curved space-time implies that the strong equivalence principle is violated outside a spherically symmetric, static star. Here we assume that quantum gravity effects restore the strong equivalence principle. Together with the assumption that the effective vacuum polarization energy-momentum tensor is traceless, this leads to a specific algebraic form of the energy-momentum tensor for which an exact solution of Einstein's field equations is found. The solution gives the post-Newtonian parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>=1 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em>=1+3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em> is a dimensionless constant which determines the energy density of the anisotropic vacuum. The vacuum energy changes the perihelion precession by a factor of 1-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em>.
Einstein's equations with variable<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and A scalars are considered for a Bianchi type I metric. A solution is found in which the cosmological term varies inversely with the square of time. As in the case of the flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">flrw</span>) models discussed recently, there is then no dimensional constant associated with A. However, it is shown that the time behaviour of Bianchi type I inflationary solutions cannot be of the pure de Sitter type. This shows that if the flat FLRW inflationary solutions previously considered are perturbed by the introduction of Bianchi type I anisotropy, then the time evolution may be perturbed from the pure exponential form.
A consistent relativistic theory of the classical Maxwell field interacting with classical, charged, point-like particles is proposed. The theory is derived from a classical “soliton-like” model of an extended particle. An approximation procedure for such a model is developed, which leads to an “already renormalized” formula for the total four-momentum of the system composed of fields and particles. Conservation of this quantity leads to a theory which is universal (i.e. does not depend upon a specific model we start with) and which may be regarded as a simple and necessary completion of special relativity. The renormalization method proposed here may be considered as a realization of Einstein's idea of “deriving equations of motion from field equations”. It is shown that the Dirac's “3-dots” equation does not describe a fundamental law of physics, but only a specific family of solutions of our theory, corresponding to a specific choice of the field initial data.
In the following we shall make some remarks on the existence of the generalized radiation gauge if space-time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is topologically non trivial (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M ≠ R</em><sup>4</sup>). This special<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1)-gauge generalizes in a sense the wellknown Coulomb gauge and if it is possible to use that gauge the Maxwell equations reduce to a well defined elliptical eigenvalue problem. This can be discussed using, for example, the Hodge theory and the theory of the spectrum of elliptic differential operators.
We show that the massive wave equation is separable in two particular colliding Einstein-Maxwell waves space-times. The first is the type D metric of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos whereas the second is the doubly polarized Bell-Szekeres solution which is of Petrov type General.
Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">cmb</span>) radiation provide the strongest evidence for the isotropy of the observable universe on the largest scales. However, the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">cmb</span> is received from regions which were not in causal contact at the time of last scattering. This is the horizon problem and the generally accepted solution is to invoke an inflationary period in the early universe. We consider the possibility that the universe did not necessarily inflate, but was filled with a network of evolving wormholes connecting otherwise causally disjoint regions. These wormholes emerged naturally from the Planck epoch and need only have stayed open for a very brief time (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δt</em>&lt;10<sup>−34</sup> sec) in order to have thermalized the early universe.
It is shown that Lorentzian manifolds giving rise to the radiation connection, i.e. such that the canonical connection induces a unique connection on an isotropic hypersurface, are of type D or conformally flat in Petrov classification, generalizing the Robinson-Bertotti electromagnetic universe with cosmological constant. Under an holonomy hypothesis it is deduced that the underlying space-time manifold is a direct product of two two-dimensional spaces, one of them being space-like, and the other one time-like.
The possibility of having a de Sitter asymptotic stage free of choice of the value of the positive cosmological constant (“no critical λ”) is analyzed in a closed FLRW universe which starts from a “quiescent” phase of evolution and ends into a “textured” phase by taking into account multiplet<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1) scalar fields.
A theory of gravitation with torsion that is derived from a potential is developed. An explicit material action is presented that gives rise to the correct conservation laws and equations of motion. It is shown that the Noether identities yield the same conservation laws as the Bianchi identities, and the Papapetrou method is used to develop the propagation equations and the force law. The equations are put in the nonrelativistic limit and the 3-vector formulation is displayed.
Some Bianchi type cosmological models-two in four and one in higher dimensions-are here studied in the context of cosmic strings. The physical implications of the models are briefly discussed. It is interesting to note that cosmic strings do not occur in Bianchi type V cosmology.
The possibility of solving the horizon problem in standard cosmology, using textures, is discussed in detail. Analysis of the model with dust, textures and radiation shows that the solution of the problem requires a very specific and relatively large value of the textures energy density. It is also shown that the period of time over which the background radiation is observed to be isotropic is much shorter than it had seemed so far on the basis of rough estimates.
The possible existence of a conformal perfect fluid in the classical vacuum is investigated in this paper. It is shown, contrary to Madsen's opinion, that the scalar field stress tensor acquires a perfect fluid form even with a nonminimal coupling (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em>=1/6) in the Einstein Lagrangian provided the geometry is the Lorentzian analog of the Euclidean Hawking wormhole. In addition, our<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> equals, up to a constant factor, the vacuum expectation value of Fulling's stress tensor for a massless scalar field and Visser's one concerning traversable wormholes. On the other side of the light cone, there is a coordinate system (the dimensionally reduced Witten bubble) where the stress tensor becomes diagonal.
We derive in this paper an exact spherically symmetric solution coupled to scalar fields in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. A seven-dimensional solution is shown as a special case of the general solution. The solution has two even horizons. The inner horizon corresponds to the Schwarzschild black hole and the outer horizon is due to the scalar fields.
An acceleration phase in the early universe allows microscopic quantum fluctuations inside a causal domain to expand into macroscopic ripples in the spacetime metric. These, in turn, can evolve into large-scale structures in the universe. After its generation from quantum fluctuations, a ripple in the metric spends a long period outside the causal domain where its evolution is characterized by a conserved amplitude, a fact closely related to the large-scale Friedmann-like evolution of the perturbed Friedmann universe. We show that, under the assumption of linear processes, the generation and evolution of large-scale structures can be described quite simply.
LRS Bianchi I space-time filled with a perfect fluid is considered and it is shown that the field equations are solvable for any arbitrary cosmic scale function. Solutions for a particular form of cosmic sclae functions are presented and all solutions, except for some cases, are shown to represent an empty universe for large time.
A Lagrangian formalism of spinning particles in general relativity is given. The (extended) configurational space is chosen to be the Lorentzbundle, and a Lagrangian is constructed from the presymplectic potential of Künzle's canonical dynamics.
The energy of the universe, including the energy of the matter and that of the gravitational field, is investigated with the help of the Einstein gravitational pseudo-tensor. It is found that the total energy vanishes.
Recent progress in computing the energy of the universe including the gravitational contribution is discussed. Various issues are raised including symmetries, energy localization and observational verification.
The existing refutal, in four-dimensional spacetimes, of the conjecture that the Lanczos tensor can be used as a potential for the Riemann tensor, is derived in a much simpler manner which is valid for dimension n ≥ 4 and any signature.


We study the interior structure of a locally conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity in the presence of a static, spherically symmetric gravitational source. We find, quite remarkably, that the associated dynamics is determined exactly and without any approximation at all by a simple fourth order Poisson equation which thus describes both the strong and weak field limits of the theory in this static case. We present the solutions to this fourth order equation and find that we are able to recover all of the standard Newton-Euler gravitational phenomenology in the weak gravity limit, to thus establish the observational viability of the weak field limit of the fourth order theory. Additionally, we make a critical analysis of the second order Poisson equation, and find that the currently available experimental evidence for its validity is not as clearcut and definitive as is commonly believed, with there not apparently being any conclusive observational support for it at all either on the very largest distance scales far outside of fundamental sources, or on the very smallest ones within their interiors. Our study enables us to deduce that even though the familiar second order Poisson gravitational equation may be sufficient to yield Newton's Law of Gravity it is not in fact necessary.
The strong analogy between states defined in the context of quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFT-CST) and the ones defined in the thermo field dynamics (TFD) of Takahashi and Umezawa [1] is shown. This analogy is useful in order to introduce the entropy operator in CST in the same way as in TFD. When the extremum condition in the thermodynamical potential is imposed, a family of Bogoliubov transformations that give us a planckian spectrum is found, even in “pathological” cases such as the minimally coupled scalar field.
Recent calculations have shown the existence of critical phenomena in general relativity associated with the collapse of wavepackets of massless fields that are near, in parameter space, the onset of black hole formation (the critical point). Two physically distinct systems have been explored: collapse of spherically-symmetric massless scalar field and collapse of vacuum, axisymmetric gravitational waves. Nonlinear effects dominate near the critical point. Black-hole mass serves as an order parameter and has a power-law dependence on critical separation in the supercritical region of parameter space. Remarkably, the values of the critical exponent of the power law are nearly identical in the two systems. The nonlinearity induces the fields to oscillate. Each successive oscillation is an echo, obeying a spatial and temporal scaling relation.
A scenario of galaxy formation is outlined which is based essentially on the fact that the cosmic matter about 10<sup>6</sup>yr after the end of the recombination period is a general relativistic Boltzmann gas very close to equilibrium. In this scenario the observed very small inhomogeneities of the background radiation lead to very sharply edged gas clouds in the centres of the inhomogeneities. The universe between the clouds is completely swept clean of matter. If one assumes the centres of the inhomogeneities to be axially symmetric, the mass spectrum of the clouds extends from the smallest globular clusters with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> ≃ 10<sup>5</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>⊙</sub> as the lower limit (spherical symmetry) up to the big spiral galaxies with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> ≃ 10<sup>11</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>⊙</sub> as the upper limit (maximal flattening). The upper limit masses are extremely thin pancakes which contract within a time interval of about 2 · 10<sup>9</sup> years to the proportions of an ordinary spiral galaxy of today.
The great simplicity attained by the Weyl-van der Waerden spinor technique in the evaluation of helicity invariant amplitudes is shown to apply in the cumbersome calculations within the framework of linearized gravitation. Once the graviton couplings to spin-0, 1/2, 1, and 3/2 particles are given, we exhibit the reach of this method by evaluating, as an example, the helicity amplitudes for the process electron + positron → photon + graviton in a very straightforward way.

We demonstrate a possible explanation of the observed periodicity of the large-scale distribution of galaxies as an effect of the global rotation of the universe.
The subject of the paper is the formulation and analysis of the notion of spherical symmetry for a spacetime with matter of multidimensional objects (also called extended particles) i.e. matter, whose elementary constituents are extensive objects. The paper includes also eduction of a subclass of vacuum, static, spherically-symmetric solutions of the Einstein equation in the spacetime mentioned above. In particular a close analogue of the Schwarzschild solution is obtained.
In this essay we discuss how the statistics of quantum particles, namely, stimulated emission for bosons and the exclusion principle for fermions, provide mechanisms for correlating the radiations impinging and emanating from a black hole. In either case, the information originally borne by the incoming radiation that is partially transferred to the outging radiation is estimated within the framework of communication theory.
We present a method for generating exact solutions of Einstein equations in vacuum using harmonic maps, when the spacetime possesses two commuting Killing vectors. This method consists of writing the axisymmetric stationary Einstein equations in vacuum as a harmonic map which belongs to the group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2,ℝ), and decomposing it into its harmonic “submaps”. This method provides a natural classification of the solutions in classes (Weyl's class, Lewis' class etc.).
The (2+1)-dimensional Einstein equations are solved exactly for a viscous fluid with both rotation and expansion. The thermodynamic relations are investigated and relevant physical quantities, including coefficients of viscosity and thermal conductivity, are shown to be physically reasonable for a range of coordinate values corresponding to an interior fluid solution. This range of coordinates must be restricted further if closed timelike curves are to be excluded.
The dynamical and thermodynamical effects of a bulk viscous pressure and particle production on the early universe are analyzed in the framework of open thermodynamical systems. Analytical solutions are obtained for particle number density, temperature and entropy for most of the models.
The conclusions of paper [2] are modified: using the shell formalism, relativistic effect could eventually be detected in X-ray bursters.


A seminumeric method by Herrera, Jiménez and Ruggeri is used to study the evolution of general relativistic spheres in the free streaming radiation approximation, when specific contraction schemes are imposed and for particular oscillatory radiation profiles. On one hand, the emerging radiation is studied for oscillating contracting spheres, on the other, the variation of the boundary surface is analyzed when a pulsating profile is provided. We consider three particular equations of state previously studied. It is found that the oscillatory frequency of the surface for the equations of state considered coincides with the frequency of the oscillation for the radiation profile.
We interpret the 15 equations of Kaluza-Klein gravity as 10 Einstein equations, 1 wave equation and 4 equations of motion. An exact cosmological solution of the apparently empty 5D field equations describes a 4D fluid with an effective density and pressure induced by the curvature associated with the fifth dimension. The rest mass of a particle in the fluid depends on the global solution and changes slowly with time. This approach to Kaluza-Klein theory in general results in Machian cosmologies.
We derive Fermat's principle from the causal structure of spacetime, as well as from an appropriate variational principle. We show that the latter leads to a particular Hamilton-Jacobi formalism.
By using the [General Relativity + additional matter fields] formulation (which depends on a redefined metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>) of metric theories of gravitation, the study of singularities characterized by incomplete nonspacelike geodesics is simplified, but may be used only if (at least) the non-spacelike geodesics of the original metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> are conserved under the transformation between<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> and the new metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>. In order that every class of geodesies of a diagonal Bianchi I metric correspond to the same class of geodesies of a diagonal metric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>, it is necessary that the transformation between these two metrics be a constant (positive) conformal transformation. We analyse the implications of the previous results for the singularities<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> when the latter is a solution of theories with a quadratic or polynomial Lagrangian.
We examine the kinematic and dynamic properties of fluid spacetimes in higher order gravity. In particular we extend the general equations of Ehlers and Ellis governing relativistic fluid dynamics from general relativity to the higher order theory. We find exact results for the evolution of shear in Bianchi spacetimes with isotropic surfaces, thus generalising the general relativity results. Furthermore we show that the vanishing of vorticity, shear and acceleration does not imply FRW geometry in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R + αR</em><sup>2</sup> gravity without the further assumption of a barotropic equation of state,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p = p(p), p′(p) ⊋</em> 0. In particular, this result means that the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs theorem on cosmic background radiation also holds in the higher order theory.
A recent model based on massive electrodynamics in spaces with torsion gave rise to London type equations with Meissner-like effects and photon mass. This effective photon mass can be related to a time-varying torsion background in the early universe. Its present value is estimated and found to lie well within current experimental limits.
Fermi coordinates (FC) are supposed to be the natural extension of Cartesian coordinates for an arbitrary moving observer in curved space-time. Since their construction cannot be done on the whole space or even in the whole past of the observer we examine which construction principles are responsible for this effect and how they may be modified. A proposal for a modification is made and applied to the observer with constant acceleration in the two- and four-dimensional Minkowski space. The two-dimensional case shows some surprising similarities to Kruskal space which generalize those found by Rindler for the outer region of Kruskal space and the Rindler wedge. In perturbational approaches the modification also leads to different predictions for certain physical systems. As an example we consider atomic interferometry and derive the deviation of the acceleration-induced phase shift from the standard result in Fermi coordinates.
It has been recently shown that there is universality of Einstein equations, in the first-order (Palatini) formalism, in the sense that for a generic nonlinear Lagrangian depending only on the scalar curvature of a metric and a torsionless connection one always gets Einstein equations. In this paper the energy-density flow for nonlinear gravitational Lagrangians is investigated in this formalism. It is shown that in the generic case the energy-momentum complex does not depend on the Lagrangian and is in fact equal to the Komar complex, known in the purely metric formalism for the standard linear Hilbert Lagrangian.
A new class of physically relevant explicit solutions for string cosmological models endowed with cylindrical symmetry on the background of singularity-free cosmological space times has been obtained and their physical and kinematical features are discussed. The matter-free limits of this class of solutions are observed to be the singularity-free vacuum solutions of Patel and Dadhich.
One of the most important questions in the physics of gravitation phenomena is whether gravitational collapse can lead to the formation of singularities which are not hidden by an event horizon. The Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (CCC) represents the hope that such a drastic event cannot happen in realistic physical situations. However, in the recent past several counter examples to the CCC were demonstrated by several researchers in situations of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse. The disturbing aspect about these counter examples is that they are strong naked singularities—they can crush matter to zero volume and can have a disastrous influence on causal physics. We examine these counter examples for their physical content by working through the dynamical collapse of inhomogeneous dust and argue that these are not physically acceptable counter examples. Our main result is that the singularities when naked are weak and when strong, strongly censored. The strong naked singularities in the counter examples do not arise from dynamical collapse; they result from the intrinsically singular nature of the initial density distributions chosen. The CCC seems to remain robust as far as spherically symmetric collapse is concerned.
We examine in detail a class of cosmological solutions to the coupled Einstein-KÄhler field equations in space-time geometries described by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. We consider the massive cases of the KÄhler equation for generating these solutions.
The behaviour of scalar electrodynamics under symmetry breaking by the Higgs mechanism is studied in a class of dynamical spacetimes—those having a Bianchi type I symmetry—which includes the spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetimes. The Einstein equations are used to obtain the effective Lagrangian, from which it is shown that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">either</em> the gauge field does not become massive during symmetry breaking (in marked contrast with the case in which the background spacetime is static),<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">or</em> the symmetry breaking chooses not only a direction in the phase space of the Higgs field, but also a spatial direction in the spacetime sections.
The study of interpretations of the vacuum solutions of Einstein's field equations is continued by considering some well known time-dependent solutions. Among these are metrics representing accelerating particles, cylindrical and plane waves and cosmological solutions.
Tipler has claimed in a recent scientific paper [1] that life could exist until the very end of a universe that recollapses to a final fireball in the future—including the Planck era when quantum gravity dominates. His article is one of a number that have excited general interest because of some strong claims made on the basis of this type of argument about life in the future (indeed it has even been claimed [2,3] that this type of mathematical-physical argument can prove that Resurrection of the Dead will take place!). We point out that the underlying argument of Tipler's paper runs into problems on two quite different grounds. Firstly, it assumes a flat space information theory result and makes other technical assumptions about information processing, which invalidate the immediate technical argument. However at least as important is the fact that the argument is unsustainable because physical mechanisms required to make coherent information processing possible would not be able to operate under the extreme physical conditions that would occur towards the end of the universe.

Gravitational solitons are used in order to match two spatially homogeneous cosmological models with different homogeneity groups. We show that some Bianchi cosmological models, which were considered inappropriate for description of the early universe, might be flattened by a reasonable physical mechanism. Multisoliton cosmological models are also discussed and the normalization conditions for the solitary “amplitudes” are given in order to avoid unphysical behaviour at the spatial infinity. Gravi-soliton-matter interaction is analysed in the case of cosmological models filled with “stiff” irrotational fluid and the behaviour of geometrical and kinematical quantities is studied in detail.
Canonical structures in the parametric picture of gravitation in general relativity are investigated. One of the fields, the scalar<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>, emerges as a secondary entity that interacts with a system consisting of the threemetric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> and the connection form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>. We are employing the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g,ω</em>) system for developing a canonical approach. While a naïve attempt would appear to founder, we do find an extension of the phase-space of the system which is computationally viable.
We consider the Einstein equations for a Bianchi type I geometry, modified by first-order semiclassical quantum corrections. Using reduction techniques developed by Parker and Simon, we simplify these equations, obtaining reduced forms containing only first and second derivatives. We then find analytical solutions for both the vacuum case and for the case of a perfect fluid with a stiff equation of state. In the vacuum case we find that the Kasner solution maintains the same form in both the classical and semiclassical regimes. In the matter-filled case we observe, however, that a qualitatively different behavior emerges in the semiclassical era. We comment on the nature of these differences.
Structured space, as a natural generalization of the manifold concept, is defined to be a topological space with a sheaf of real function algebras which are suitably localized and closed with respect to composition with smooth Euclidean functions. Vector fields, differential forms, linear connection and curvature are introduced on structured spaces. It is shown that structured spaces correctly model space-times with singularities. Schmidt's b-boundary of space-time is constructed in the category of structured spaces, and well known difficulties with the b-boundaries of the closed Friedman and Schwarzschild space-times are disentangled. It is argued that the b-boundary of space-time, when considered in the category of structured spaces, can serve as a good definition of classical singularities.
We apply the Lynden-Bell and Katz (LK) definition of gravitational energy to static and spherically symmetric space-times which admit a curvature singularity. These are the Tolman V, Tolman VI and the interior Schwarzschild solutions, the latter with the boundary limit of 9/8th of the gravitational radius. We show that the LK definition can still be applied to these solutions despite the presence of a singularity which nonetheless appears to carry no energy in the LK sense. While in the solutions that we mentioned the KL gravitational energy is positive definite everywhere in space time, this is not the case for the overcharged Reissner-Nordström space-time. In the latter case in fact the LK energy density becomes negative sufficiently close to the singularity hence we use the positivity criterion to impose a more stringent limit of validity to the Reissner-Nordström solution.
Geodesics for a 5D magnetized Schwarzschild-like solution are analyzed by reducing the problem to the motion of a test particle in an effective potential. In absence of magnetic field comparison is established with Schwarzschild's geometry. Embedding diagrams are constructed in order to visualize the geometry of the metric. The study performed here is also valid, when the electromagnetic interactions are neglected, for the low energy superstring theory and the Brans-Dicke theory.


On the basis of the approach to generation of Einstein-Maxwell fields proposed by Jan Horský and Nikolai Mitskievich, a magnetization of the pencil-of-light space-time is performed yielding a superposition of the fields of a spinning pencil of light and of the Bonnor-Melvin universe. An interplay of Petrov's types in this superposition is revealed. A generalization of Wald's theorem on test electromagnetic fields on a vacuum space-time background is achieved thus explaining applicability of our approach to space-times of the Levi-Cività type.
We establish a connection between conformally related Einstein spaces and conformai killing vectors (CKV). We begin with the conformal map and prove that (a) under the conformal mapping<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">¯g</em><sub>ik</sub>=Ω<sup>−2</sup>g<sub>ik</sub>, the necessary and sufficient condition for the tracefree part of the Ricci tensor (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>ik</sub>=R<sub>ik</sub>−(R/4)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ik</sub>) to remain invariant is that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em><sub>i</sub> is a CKV of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>ik</sub>, and (b) the most general form for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em> for conformally flat Einstein space, which is the de Sitter space, is composed of three terms each of which alone represents a flat space. The existence of gradient CKV (GCKV) is examined in relation to vacuum and perfect fluid spacetimes.
The general solution of Møller's field equations in case of spherical symmetry is derived. The previously obtained solutions are verified as special cases of the general solution.
An infinite family of exact solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations for the static case with axial symmetry is presented in an explicit form. Each solution of this family contains two arbitrary parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> that represent the mass and quadrupole moment of the source. In addition, each solution can be interpreted physically as the pure relativistic quadrupole correction to the Schwarzschild solution at a given multipole order.
The phenomenological approach to investigating the decay of the vacuum energy density is generalized in the spirit of Dirac's large number hypothesis. Different arguments are outlined to justify an universal dependence of the type λ=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ΒH</em><sup>2</sup> (Β is a pure number and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> is the Hubble parameter). Such time-varying A does change the predictions of the earlier Dirac's cosmology. The deceleration parameter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sub>0</sub>=(2−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Β</em>)/(1+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Β</em>)) and the age parameter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>0</sub>t<sub>0</sub>=(1+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Β</em>)/3) are now compatible with the observations. The model also allows a “power-law” inflationary phase and a rate of matter creation smaller than the one present in the steady state universe.
We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the regularity of all scalar invariants polynomial in the Riemann tensor at the origin of spherically, cylindrically and plane symmetric static spacetimes under the assumption that the metric functions are sufficiently smooth there. These conditions turn out to be simple enough to allow a check for regularity by inspection.



L.R.S. Bianchi type V universes filled with perfect fluid with heat conduction and radiation have been studied with the class one condition. The models obtained are discussed for their physical features.
We calculate the renormalized quantum vacuum energy inside a spherical boundary for the massless conformal scalar field in curved background Robertson-Walker geometry. We use the mode sum method with an exponential cutoff. In our calculations we do not make assumptions about the exterior geometry or the global topology of the universe.
Scalar particle production is studied in a class of anisotropic spacetimes which are the exact solutions of Einstein equations with a perfect stiff fluid. Massless field creations are also discussed.
A Euclidean version of the Newman-Penrose formalism is developed for the study of gravitational instantons. The formalism is explicitly based on the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2)×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) spin structure of positive definite metrics. A Geroch-Held-Penrose formulation is also presented. The Euclidean analogues of several fundamental results in relativity are proved, including the Petrov classification and the Ehlers-Sachs, Goldberg-Sachs, and Mariot-Robinson theorems. In addition, the connection between Petrov type and the admissibility of complex structures is elucidated.
A Tolman-Bondi type inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric metric is obtained in an (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+2)-dimensional spacetime with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>≥2. The metric form admits the familiar shell focusing singularity which, depending on the inhomogeneity parameter, may become naked. Moreover, for the particular case of a marginally bound collapsing model one may also obtain strong-curvature singularities, which provides yet another counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis. It is interesting to point out that it is the assumption of self similarity rather than spherical symmetry which determines the nature of the singularity. This, however, extends an earlier observation of Lake and Zannias in four-dimensional spacetime.
We propose a gravitational theory based on the complete relaxing of Riemannian constraints (which force the connection to be symmetric and metric compatible) combined with the requirement of local conformal invariance. To reach this goal we generalize original Dirac's formalism of co-covariant calculus on spaces with arbitrary torsion and nonmetricity. The resulting gravitational theory turns out to be independent of the choice of measuring standards. Nevertheless there exists a mechanism of spontaneous gauge fixing through which all the masses in the universe could be generated. It is shown that field equations of the theory admit of a de Sitter solution with no cosmological constant, both in a vacuum case and in the presence of matter without proper hypermomentum. Various possible developments of the proposed theory are discussed in brief.
The solutions of both the Klein-Gordon equation and the Dirac equation near the event horizons are given in the Vaidya-de Sitter space-time. With a new method the locations of the black hole event horizon and universe horizon, as well as their Hawking temperatures, are shown automatically and easily.
In contrast to standard ECSK theory with the Brans-Dicke scalar field (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em>) nonminimally coupled to the curvature scalar, an additional new pseudo scalar term φ<sup>n</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sup>αβμν</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>αβμν</sub> (contraction between Levi-Civita pseudo tensor and curvature tensor) has been included in the Lagrangian. The new term is non-zero due to the non-symmetric nature of the connection and vanishes identically in the general theory of relativity. We show that there exists a nonsingular cosmological solution for a spatially flat (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>=0) Robertson-Walker line element in the radiation era; therefore our model has no big bang.
By using an alternative method valid in weak and strong gravitational fields, we study beam collimation, light bending and time delays in the equatorial Kerr spacetime. Three applications are carried out. First, it is shown that the interaction “spin-orbit” could collimate a beam only if the particle or photon moves in a opposite direction to the compact object's spin. Secondly, the deflection angles of light rays grazing a quasar, a pulsar (PSR 1937+214), and a rotating black hole are computed and compared with approximate solutions. Finally, we calculate the photon's time delay traveling from SN1987A to Earth. The result of this undertaking is compared with a similar calculation using the PPN formalism.
Electromagnetic fields yielding plane symmetric metrics in higher-dimensional spacetimes are exhausted and classified. It is shown that these EM fields must fall into one of the following two cases: (i)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">it</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iz</em> </sub>=0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em>=1,...,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>; (ii)F<sub>tz</sub>=0. We give the general solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in higher dimensions corresponding to electromagnetic fields of case (ii) with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">it</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iz</em> </sub>, which covers all even-dimensional spacetimes as well as a subcase of odd-dimensional spacetimes.
A tetrad formulation of gravity with a torsion potential is presented. The torsion is derived from the exterior derivative of a second rank tensor potential. The geometrical Lagrangian is the curvature scalar and variations are taken with respect to the tetrad components. It is shown that the resulting field equations, and conservation laws, are identical to those obtained in a purely holonomic frame.
We consider the disagreements in gravitational properties of planar and spherical domain walls (bubbles). We argue that if the spherical domain walls are described by the same equation of state as the planar walls are, then they also exhibit gravitational repulsion just as the planar walls are assumed to do. In the thin-wall approximation we show the existence of the solution of Einstein equations with negative gravitational mass of bubbles and the reversed direction of time flow on the shell. The equilibrium radius and critical mass of such objects are found for realistic models.
We study the dynamics of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe conformally coupled to a real, self-interacting, massive scalar field. We apply a full set of tools corresponding to dynamical system theory: fixed points, linear stability analysis, resonances study and numerical evaluation of Poincaré sections of the dynamical flux. We can conclude that the chaotic behaviour is possible in the very early universe. In the case of a spatially closed universe we show that the route to chaos is reached by successive breaking of the resonant tori due to the action of 1∶1 resonances.
It is shown that, for time independent fields, the two seemingly different and unrelated Tolman and Møller mass-energy formulae in general relativity are, in fact, completely equivalent.

We revisit the long standing problem of analyzing an inertial electric charge from the point of view of uniformly accelerated observers in the context of semi-classical gravity. We choose a suitable set of accelerated observers with respect to which there is no photon emission coming from the inertial charge. We discuss this result against previous claims.
It is pointed out that string-loop effects may generate matter couplings for the dilaton allowing this scalar partner of the tensorial graviton to stay massless while contributing to macroscopic gravity in a way naturally compatible with existing experimental data. Under a certain assumption of universality of the dilaton coupling functions, the cosmological evolution drives the dilaton towards values where it decouples from matter. At the present cosmological epoch, the coupling to matter of the dilaton should be very small, but non zero. This provides a new motivation for improving the experimental tests of Einstein's Equivalence Principle.
An invariant definition of mass is given, within the context of a geometric unified theory, in terms of the geometric connection and the matter current. This geometric mass corresponds to the concept of self energy and leads to the mass parameter in Dirac's equation.
The general relativistic formula for charge distribution inside conductors has been obtained from the Maxwell equations with the help of the constitutive relations. The charge distribution and fields that will arise in a conductor which has no conduction current have been considered. The general relativistic effect is shown to be a sum of two contributions: one due to the absolute acceleration and one due to the relativistic rate of rotation. Possibilities of detecting the last effect in the rotating frame of reference are studied. In fact, in the first order in the angular velocity<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\rightharpoonup}$}} {\omega } \)</span> the proper charge density<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\rho _0 = - ({1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 {2\pi c}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {2\pi c}})(\overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\rightharpoonup}$}} {\omega } \overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\rightharpoonup}$}} {H} )\)</span> is induced inside the conductor in the presence of magnetic field<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\rightharpoonup}$}} {H} \)</span>. Under the same conditions the charge distribution density is equal to zero inside superconductors. The qualitative distinction of the space charge distribution inside conductors from the one inside superconductors allows us to suggest a new electrodynamic test of general relativity. Another way of measurement is connected with the dependence of charge distribution inside the conductor on its space orientation.
We consider an alternative fourth-order gravity Lagrangian which is nonanalytic in the Ricci scalar, and apply it to a Robertson-Walker metric. We find vacuum solutions which undergo power-law inflation. Once matter is introduced the theory behaves very much like ordinary General Relativity, except that the radiation evolution α ∼ √<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> is not allowed since it corresponds to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>=0. We comment on the possibility of wormhole solutions in such a theory.
We present a novel derivation of all the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor. Our approach is entirely geometric, using as it does the natural equivariance of the Levi-Civita map with respect to diffeomorphisms. An important conclusion is that<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">all</em> symmetries of the curvature tensor have their origin in “the principle of general covariance“.
A detailed study of cosmological models with constant deceleration parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> is undertaken in the framework of Brans-Dicke theory. These models are divided into two categories: (i) singular models with expansion driven by big-bang impulse, (ii) non-singlar models with expansion driven by creation of matter particles. Prigogine's hypothesis of creation of matter out of gravitational energy is analysed and extended to BD cosmology. To accommodate the creation of new particles, the universe is regarded as an open thermodynamical system and the energy conservation equation is modified with the incorporation of a creation pressure term<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub> in the energy-momentum tensor<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\tilde T_{ab} \)</span>. The exact solutions of the field equations of BD theory with<span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\tilde T_{ab} \)</span> are obtained using the power law relation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ=KR</em><sup>α</sup>, which leads to models with constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>. The behaviour of the solutions is investigated for different range of values of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. The role played by the BD scalar field<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em> and creation of matter particles in the expansion of the universe is investigated. It is found that one particular model with constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> has exponential expansion.
A local characterization of Schwarzschild and Reissner metrics is made by using the concepts of infinitesimal null anisotropy (or equivalently, infinitesimal isotropy) and weak affinity.
The exterior solution for an arbitrary charged, massive source is studied as a static deviation from the Reissner-Nordström metric This is reduced to two coupled ordinary differential equations for the gravitational and electrostatic potential functions. The homogeneous equations are explicitly solved in the particular case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><sup>2</sup>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup>, obtaining a multipole expansion with radial hypergeometric dependence for both potentials. In the limiting case of a neutral source, the equations are shown to coincide with recent results by Bondi and Rindler.
We investigate the influence of particle number nonconserving processes on the thermal history and the dynamics of the universe. There occurs a backreaction both on the temperature and on the scale factor if particles of one species decay into particles of another species, or if the overall particle number changes. This backreaction is determined by the ratios of the relevant decay and production rates to the Hubble expansion rate. It results in reheating phenomena and modifications of the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) expansion laws. A high production rate at the Planck scale tends to avoid the cosmological singularity.
A common feature of reparametrization invariant theories is the difficulty involved in identifying an appropriate evolution parameter and in constructing a Hilbert space on states. Two well known examples of such theories are the relativistic point particle and the canonical formulation of quantum gravity. The strong analogy between them (specially for minisuperspace models) is considered in order to stress the correspondence between the “localization problem” and the “problem of time,” respectively. A possible solution for the first problem was given by the proper time formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. Thus, we extrapolate the main outlines of such a formalism to the quantum gravity framework. As a consequence, a proposal to solve the problem of time arises.


In this essay we compare the response of a black hole to incoming radiation to that one of a system consisting of a hot source hidden behind a semi-transparent mirror, and the two happen to agree. Then, we display a thermodynamical proof showing that this agreement is not incidental: it is a universal feature of an ideal grey body. As a by-product of this argument the universality of superradiance emerges: absorptive media in rotation, instead of damping incoming radiation, are responsible for its amplification for all superradiant modes. Our main conclusion here is that the black hole response to incoming radiation and superandiance are not features that arise because black holes are “exceptional” systems but, on the contrary, because they are very “ordinary” in the sense that they fall into the category of ideal grey bodies.
We show that highly excited Rydberg atoms nearby astrophysical gravitational wave sources are expected to emit significant electromagnetic radiation in the radio through a process of gravitationally induced resonance fluorescence. Semiclassical arguments are discussed and a quantum-mechanical expression for the differential cross section is obtained. This process could provide a new observational tool for the remote detection and study of gravitational waves.
The homogeneous and isotropic Brans-Dicke cosmological solutions satisfying Whitrow-Randall's relation which have been discussed recently by Berman and Som are re-examined. After correcting an error in their work, we extend their results and present the most general solution by solving a differential equation completely. We show that Mach's assumption leads to power-law solutions in the Euclidean case.
In general relativity bounds were given on the possible divergency rates of the elements and of the trace of the tidal-force tensor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>abcd</sub>u<sup>b</sup>u<sup>d</sup> along incomplete maximal causal geodesics. These results are transformed into the Einstein-Cartan theory and are illustrated with two simple examples of spacetimes filled with charged spinless and spinning perfect fluids interacting with electromagnetic field.
The Wheeler-DeWitt equation is applied to closed<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>&gt;0 Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric with various combination of cosmological constant and matter (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas). It is shown that if the universe ends in the matter dominated era (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas) with zero cosmological constant, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a bound state problem. As solutions of a nondegenerate bound state system, the eigen-wave functions are real (Hartle-Hawking). Furthermore, as a bound state problem, there exists a quantization condition that relates the curvature of the three space with the various energy densities of the universe. If we assume that our universe is closed, then the quantum number of our universe is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>∼(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gk</em>)<sup>−1</sup>∼10<sup>122</sup>. The largeness of this quantum number is naturally explained by an early inflationary phase which resulted in a flat universe we observe today. It is also shown that if there is a cosmological constant Λ&gt;0 in our universe that persists for all time, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a non-bound state system, regardless of the magnitude of the cosmological constant. As a consequence, the wave functions are in general complex (Vilenkin).
It is shown by using covariant expressions that in the framework of the isotropic and homogeneous cosmology the gravitational energy and matter energy, the gravitational and matter linear and angular momentum, cancel each other out locally, resulting in the corresponding global quantities being zero.
The conventional perturbative approach to quantum gravity is based on the expansion in powers of √k, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> denotes the Einstein gravitational constant. The introduction of a square root is due to the unreasonable postulate that the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>→0 limit of the gravitational field is a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>-number. It is more natural that it is a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>-number, which can be determined explicitly by the theory, and then the expansion becomes that in powers of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> but not of √<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. Thus the nonrenormalizability of Einstein gravity should be completely reconsidered in the light of the new expansion.
A new technique is introduced in order to solve the following question:<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">When is a complete spacelike hypersurface of constant mean curvature in a generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime totally umbilical and a slice</em>? (Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes extend classical Robertson-Walker ones to include the cases in which the fiber has not constant sectional curvature.) First, we determine when this hypersurface must be compact. Then, all these compact hypersurfaces in (necessarily spatially closed) spacetimes are shown to be totally umbilical and, except in very exceptional cases, slices. This leads to proof of a new Bernstein-type result. The power of the introduced tools is also shown by reproving and extending several known results.
It is shown that a charged spherically symmetric star, made out of a continuous superposition of thin shells with Poincaré stresses, undergoes gravitational collapse in free fall like an uncharged star of dust. The interior solution is a Friedmann universe matching the Reissner-Nordström geometry at the boundary of the star. When the absolute value of the charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> does not exceed the mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, the star rebounds elastically inside the event horizon at the radial coordinate<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em><sup>2</sup>/(2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>). The further history of the charged star after the bounce is analyzed. Besides, a simple mechanism which accounts for the development of Poincaré stresses in an originally charged star of dust is suggested. It is also verified that the energy density is nonnegative all along the collapse process.
Let<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> be a partial Cauchy surface for (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, go</em>) which remains a partial Cauchy surface under small metric perturbations. In general, the Cauchy horizon H<sup>+</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">go, S</em>) may be unstable to small changes in the metric. Points of the horizon may move by large amounts and even the topological type of the horizon may change under arbitrarily small changes in the metric tensor. In this paper, we investigate sufficient conditions for existential, locational, and topological stability of Cauchy horizons under metric changes which perturb the light cones by small amounts.


We present a new<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">finite</em> action for Einstein gravity in which the Lagrangian is quadratic in the covariant derivative of a spinor field. Via a new spinor-curvature identity, it is related to the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian by a total differential term. The corresponding Hamiltonian, like the one associated with the Witten positive energy proof, is fully 4-covariant. It defines quasi-local energy-momentum and can be reduced to the one in our recent positive energy proof.
We study the occurrence of critical phenomena in four-dimensional, rotating and charged black holes, derive the critical exponents and show that they fulfill the scaling laws. Correlation function critical exponents and Renormalization Group considerations assign an effective (spatial) dimension,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>=2, to the system. The two-dimensional Gaussian approximation to critical systems is shown to reproduce all the black hole's critical exponents. Higher order corrections (which are always relevant) are discussed. Identifying the two-dimensional surface with the event horizon and noting that generalization of scaling leads to conformal invariance and then to string theory, we arrive at 't Hooft's string interpretation of black holes. From this, a model for dealing with a coarse grained black hole quantization is proposed. We also give simple arguments that lead to a rough quantization of the black hole mass in units of the Planck mass, i.e.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>≃(1/√2)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>Pl</sub>√<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> with an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> positive integer and then, from this result, to the proportionality between quantum entropy and area.
We show that it is possible, by a suitable choice of metrics and connections, to construct for a wide class of relativistic equations of motion a geometry wherein the interacting particles become free of nongravitational forces and move on autoparallels. Some examples prove the consistency of this “extended geodesic principle.
Subject to the static spherical-symmetric condition, we found an exact metric solution and spin current of the Poincaré gauge field equations derived in Ref. 1. In the solution there are the terms of the Schwarzschild metric solution and new gauge terms<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−1</sup> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>2</sup> ln<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>.
Classical models of elementary particles, regarded as the ultimate constituents of the known particles, are considered in the framework of general relativity. The work is based on that of López, using the Kerr-Newman solution of the Einstein field equations.
The center of trace<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>CT</sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> </span> of the energy-momentum tensor of a spinning particle in General Relativity is defined. It is shown to be an invariant point of the particle, and its path is shown to be what is specified by the original side condition of Mathisson,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sup>αβ</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sub>β</sub>=0.
Inflationary models and their claim to solve many of the outstanding problems in cosmology have been the subject of a great deal of debate over the last few years. A major sticking point has been the lack of both good observational and theoretical arguments to single out one particular model out of the many that solve these problems. Here we examine the degree of restrictiveness on the dynamical relationship between the cosmological scale factor and the inflation driving self-interaction potential of a minimally coupled scalar field, imposed by the condition that the scalar field is required to be real during a classical regime (the reality condition). We systematically look at the effects of this constraint on many of the inflationary models found in the literature within the FLRW framework, and also look at what happens when physically motivated perturbations such as shear and bulk viscosity are introduced. We find that in many cases, either the models are totally excluded or the reality condition gives rise to constraints on the scale factor and on the various parameters of the model.
Density perturbations are considered during the radiation-dominated and the dust-dominated periods of the expanding universe. The perturbations are taken to have spherical symmetry and the investigation is carried out in the de Donder gauge. In order to guarantee the energy-momentum conservation of the perturbation in the de Donder gauge a compatibility condition is obtained. Equations for the propagation of a spherically symmetric perturbation in linear approximation on a FRW cosmological background are presented. It turns out that the evolution<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tendency</em> of the formation is mainly predicted by the state of the cosmic background. A radiation-dominated universe does not stimulate growth processes; the perturbation will be in a frozen state or it will diffuse. It is found that the dust-dominated universe stimulates the perturbation mass to grow. The rate of this cosmic affected growing process is proportional to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>−1</sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> being the scale factor of the universe), so that it seems that almost all galaxies were formed at the beginning of the present dust-dominated era.
The nature of the initial singularity in spatially compact plane symmetric scalar field cosmologies is investigated. It is shown that this singularity is crushing and velocity dominated and that the Kretschmann scalar diverges uniformly as it is approached. The last fact means in particular that a maximal globally hyperbolic spacetime in this class cannot be extended towards the past through a Cauchy horizon. A subclass of these spacetimes is identified for which the singularity is isotropic.
When the Bianchi equation and the wave equation for the Weyl spinor are written in the form which they take for Einstein spaces, but with the symmetric 4-spinor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ABCD</em> </sub> considered arbitrary and with the background space unspecified, ∇<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">EA′</em> </sup> Φ<sub>EBCD</sub>=0; (□+12λ)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ABCD</em> </sub>−6<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">EF</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">CD</em> </sub>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">EF</em> =0 it is shown that — in general — for this pair of equations to be consistent, the background space has to be an Einstein space, and the symmetric 4-spinor<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Φ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ABCD</em> </sub> has to be the Weyl spinor of this space.
A constructive axiomatic approach to the geometry of space-time in the domain of classical and quantum physics can be founded on basic experiences made with quantum objects. The corresponding matter fields are described by linear systems of partial differential equations. Their characteristics are studied. Postulates concerning the related jump cones and jump amplitudes lead to a unique conformal structure attributed to the space-time geometry.
We present a solution to the gravitational field equations in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime. The solution describes a disc of infinite radius and finite thickness. The solution has three forms which depend on the size of the acceleration. The matter content of the disc is a rotating spin fluid with a constant z acceleration and a spin density polarized along the axis of rotation. The fluid has zero axial and tangential pressures. There is a radial pressure. The energy density and pressure are finite within the disc.
An apparently innocuous property of nature is the universal alignment of the arrow of time for all physical systems, from the subatomic world to the overall cosmological dynamical evolution. This seems to point towards an explanation of irreversibility as the manifestation of a universal intrinsic property, shared by physical systems of arbitrary scales. A major step towards an understanding of this property was taken in quantum mechanics. This required no alteration of the theory itself, but an extension of its mathematical formalism. A natural attitude is therefore to adapt this procedure to cosmological considerations. The present essay is precisely devoted to the description of the peculiarities of this interpretation of the irreversible dynamical behaviour of the cosmological history.
A consistent relativistic theory of the classical Maxwell field interacting with classical, charged, point-like particles, proposed in [1], is now derived from a variational principle. For this purpose a new electrodynamical Lagrangian based on fluxes is constructed. As a result, we obtain the action principle where i) field degrees of freedom and particle degrees of freedom are kept at the same footing, ii) contrary to the standard formulation, no infinities arise, iii) energy (Hamiltonian) is obtained from the Lagrangian via the Legendre transformation, without any need of “adding a complete divergence”.
The role of gravitational energy in the evolution of the universe is examined. In co-moving coordinates, calculation of the Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor for FRW models reveals that: (i) the total energy of a spatially closed universe irrespective of the equation of state of the cosmic fluid is zero at all times, (ii) the total energy enclosed within any finite volume of the spatially flat universe is zero at all times, (iii) during inflation the vacuum energy driving the accelerated expansion and ultimately responsible for the creation of matter (radiation) in the universe, is drawn from the energy of the gravitational field. In a similar fashion, certain cosmological models which abandon adiabaticity by allowing for particle creation, use the gravitational energy directly as an energy source.
We present a unified treatment of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">slicing</em> (3+1) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">threading</em> (1+3) decompositions of spacetime in terms of foliations. It is well-known how to decompose the metric and connection in the slicing picture; this is at the heart of any initial-value problem in general relativity. We describe here the analogous problem in the threading picture, recovering the recent results of Perjés on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">parametric manifolds</em>.
In this essay we discuss an interesting recent development in semiclassical gravity. Using an improved Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the semiclassical reduction of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation turns out to give important insights into the nature and the level of validity of the semi-classical Einstein equations (SCEE). Back reactions from the quantized matter fields in SCEE are shown to be completely determined by adiabatically induced geometric<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>) gauge potentials. The finite energy from the vacuum polarization, in particular, is found to be intimately related to the ‘magnetic’ type geometric gauge potential. As a result the vacuum energy in a universe emerging from a ‘source-free’ flat simply-connected superspace is gauge equivalent to zero, leading to some dramatic consequences.


We consider the relativistic variation to the classical problem of pursuit. The pursuer makes for the point at which it sees the pursued.
An effect of geometrical phase shift is predicted for a light beam propagating in the field of a gravitational wave. For the beam travelling orthogonally to the direction of propagation of the gravitational wave from an observer and returning back after being reflected, this phase is shown to grow proportionally to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L/λ</em> where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> is the distance between the observer and reflecting system, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> the characteristic wavelength of the gravitational wave packet (for light propagating parallel or antiparallel to the gravitational wave, the geometric phase shift is absent). Gravitational radiation detection experiments are proposed using this new effect, the corresponding estimates being given.
An exact solution of Einstein's field equations for a point mass surrounded by a static, spherically symmetric fluid of strings is presented. The solution is singular at the origin. Near the string cloud limit there is a 1/r correction to Newton's force law. It is noted that at large distances and small accelerations, this law coincides with the phenomenological force law invented by Milgrom in order to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies without introducing dark matter. When interpreted in the context of a cosmological model with a string fluid, the new solution naturally explains why the critical acceleration of Milgrom is of the same order of magnitude as the Hubble parameter.
We consider the possibility of detecting gravitational waves through the measurement of a time varying phase shift using a hydrogen maser clock on a satellite. Such measurements enable us to put interesting upper limits on the contribution of the gravitational-wave background to the dimensionless density of the Universe. The requirements on residual accelerations and the sensitivity of an accelerometer on the spacecraft are shown to be realistic and could be achieved using the accelerometer technology developed by ONERA for the ARISTOTELES mission. Such an experiment placing upper limits on the cosmological gravitational wave background could be conducted using the proposed Russian satellite “Millimetron”.
Test particles are defined and a version of the Infeld/Schild theorem on geodesic motion is presented. The hypotheses of the theorem are discussed in the IPN approximation and in the Weyl static axisymmetric metrics. Initial terms in a series solution of the linearized field equations are found explicitly for a test particle on an arbitrary timelike geodesic.
The basic equation in an approach of galaxy formation proposed by the author in a recent paper is derived from a consistent weak-field expansion of the field equations and the equation of motion.
We discuss Schrödinger's approach to gravitational interactions and Weber's electrodynamics. Then we make use of this model to calculate the energy of a charge moving inside and outside an ideal capacitor. This results in an ultimate speed, c, and in the variation of the mass of the particle with the electrostatic potential and its velocity.
We present a simplified version of Bonnor's approach to the interpretation of the vacuum C metric as a preparation for using a similar method to investigate the charged case. The idea is to consider the Weyl form of the C metric without calculating the metric components explicitly in terms of the Weyl coordinates. A further coordinate transformation leads to a metric which describes space-time outside the horizons of two Schwarschild-type particles moving with uniform acceleration and joined by a spring.


The validity conditions for the extended Birkhoff theorem in multidimensional gravity with<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> internal spaces are formulated, with no restriction on space-time dimensionality and signature. Examples of matter sources and geometries for which the theorem is valid are given. Further generalization of the theorem is discussed.
We review the Edwards transformation, and investigate the Robertson transformation and the Mansouri-Sexl (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span>) transformation. It is shown that the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span> transformation is a generalization of the Robertson transformation, just as the Edwards transformation is a generalization of the Lorentz transformation. In other words, the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span> transformation differs from the Robertson transformation by a directional parameter<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">q</strong>, just as is the case for the Edwards and Lorentz transformations. So the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span> transformation predicts the same observable effects as the Robertson transformation, just as the Edwards transformation does with the Lorentz transformation. This is to say that the directional parameter<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">q</strong> representing the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light is not observable in any physical experiment. The observable difference between the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span> (Robertson) transformation(s) and the Lorentz transformation is caused by the anisotropy of the two-way speed of light. Therefore a physical test of the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ms</span> transformation is a test of the two-way speed of light, but not of the one-way speed of light.
Two pairs of parallel geodesic intervals can be generated from two such intervals with a common endpoint by suitable application of parallel transfer. When the connection coefficients are symmetric, a parallelogram-like figure with a closed perimeter can be constructed with the two pairs of sides. When the connection coefficients are asymmetric, combining the two pairs of parallel intervals yields a figure with a coordinate gap. To avoid an open perimeter, a fiber that contains many coordinate-like labels is constructed for each point. Then the gap can occur in the fiber of a single point. Thus a closed figure is obtained even when the connection is asymmetric. A process to obtain the coordinate-like quantities in the fiber of one point with respect to a nearby point is described. A discussion of transformations of the coordinate-like quantities follows and the fundamental curvature-like quantity is obtained.
We propose to study the behavior of complicated numerical solutions to Einstein's equations for generic cosmologies by following the geodesic motion of a swarm of test particles. As an example, we consider a cylinder of test particles initially at rest in the plane symmetric Gowdy universe on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>3</sup>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. For a circle of test particles in the symmetry plane, the geodesic equations predict evolution of the circle into distortions and rotations of an ellipse as well as motion perpendicular to the plane. The evolutionary sequence of ellipses depends on the initial position of the circle of particles. We display snapshots of the evolution of the cylinder.
A class of (noncompact) singularity-free spacetimes is found, where topology changes without violating the weak energy condition (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">wec</span>) or the stable causality condition.
We discuss two expressions for the conserved quantities (energy momentum and angular momentum) of the Poincaré Gauge Theory. We show, that the variations of the Hamiltonians, of which the expressions are the respective boundary terms, are well defined, if we choose an appropriate phase space for asymptotic flat gravitating systems. Furthermore, we compare the expressions with others, known from the literature.
We demonstrate that there are no gravitational waves in vacuum in 1+1 gravity, with or without a cosmological constant, and a wave-like field in regions of non-vanishing T<sub>μv</sub> is quite unlike a conventional gravitational wave in 3+1 gravity. This, and other dissimilarities, lend a word of caution to the extraction of information from lower-dimensional theories for the understanding of 3+1 gravity.
We reply to the comments made by Cooperstock and Faraoni concerning (1+1)-dimensional gravity.
The possibilities for the (full) holonomy group of a (simply connected) vacuum space-time are calculated. The non-simply connected case is also discussed.
A nonsingular closed universe model with continuous creation of radiation or matter from the vacuum is introduced. Although primordial nucleosynthesis in this model follows the standard scenario it does not require the density of baryonic matter to be well below the critical density as in standard cosmology. The model predicts a present vacuum energy comparable with the matter energy. Its predictions for the classical low red-shift cosmological tests agree with the standard flat model results.
Regge calculus is reduced to the Hamiltonian form. For this purpose the tetrad-connection formulation of the Regge calculus is used: basic variables are connection matrices and antisymmetric area tensors with appropriate bilinear conditions imposed. In these variables the action can be made quasipolynomial (with arcsin as the only deviation from polynomiality). The constraints are classified, classical and quantum consequences are discussed.
The notion of free fall plays a central role in EPS axiomatics. A constructive procedure for the detection of freely falling gravitational monopoles has been elaborated by Coleman and Korté. This was done in order to eliminate the vagueness of the primitive notion of free fall from spacetime theory. In this paper it is shown that neither the gravitational monopoles nor their free fall can be detected by the proposed procedure alone, without using physical laws beyond the mentioned spacetime theories. For this purpose, two examples of geodesic directing fields in a Schwarzschild space time are presented, one for particles obeying a special Lorentz-force equation and one for objects obeying Papapetrou's spinning particle equation. Two possibilities are discussed to overcome the difficulties of the constructive procedure.
It is shown that there are no metric-compatible connections with zero torsion on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">properly Finslerian</em>, i.e. post-Riemannian, metrics. Since Finslerian connections exist on Riemannian metrics, the torsion rather than the metric becomes the object which determines whether the geometry is properly Finslerian or not. On the other hand, the solder forms and connection are determined by the torsion if the affine curvature is zero, the torsion then containing all the information about the geometric reality of spacetime. Since the metric curvature may still be Riemannian, the question arises of whether its present central role in spacetime physics is but a consequence of requiring that all the geometric content of spacetime be contained in the metric.
We treat in an alternate way a problem recently considered by Beesham [1]. We find that anisotropic Bianchi I inflationary cosmologies with variable gravitational and cosmological “constants” admit de Sitter expansion at least for late times.
We show that for a specific choice of our seed function we obtain an interesting solution which reduces to the well-known solutions of Khan-Penrose, Bell-Szekeres and Ferrari-Ibáñez-Griffiths in particular limits. We also present a solution that describes the collision of gravitational quadrupoles.
In Minkowskian spaces, the helicity of a massless fermion is a conserved quantity. In principle, this property may not hold when gravitational effects are not neglected. In this context, this work proves that the helicity of a massless neutrino is not conserved in curved spaces. In order to show this fact, the time variation of the helicity in the Heisenberg picture is calculated. Also, we verify that the differential cross-section due to helicity flip of a massless neutrino in a curved space does not vanish as a result of the coupling between the spin and the curvature of space-time.
A family of cylindrically symmetric new solutions to Einstein-Maxwell equations is obtained by using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The electromagnetic fields in this family are nonnull, and the Weyl tensor of the metrics is of Petrov type II.
The relationship between Einstein's vacuum field equations and classical spin-3/2 field equations is re-explored using two-component spinor valued differential forms. One-form and two-form expressions for spin-3/2 fields and their field equations are considered and a Lagrangian formulation is presented. Complex structures defined by spin-3/2 fields are considered.
We describe an elementary proof that a manifold with the topology of the Politzer time machine does not admit a nonsingular, asymptotically flat Lorentz metric.

The exact solution of the Maxwell equations in the most common nonstationary homogeneous Gödel-type metric is given. The frequency spectrum of the electromagnetic field and its connetion with polarization are considered. The principal difference of that spectrum in causal and acausal metrics is outlines. The spectrum is divided into three regions: one discrete and two different continuous ones. The discrete part and one of the continuous parts differ from the third one: in that case the dispersion relation is not<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω → −ω</em> symmetric (due to the rotation of the universe). The helicity-angular-velocity-coupling in a rotating universe makes in some cases the positive and negative continua intersect.
We consider gravity from the quantum field theory point of view and introduce a natural way of coupling gravity to matter by following the gauge principle for particle interactions. The energy-momentum tensor for the matter fields is shown to be conserved and follows as a consequence of the dynamics in a spontaneously broken<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3, 2) gauge theory of gravity. All known interactions are described by the gauge principle at the microscopic level.
We investigate causality relations on a class of spacetimes that include warped products as a special case, and construct globally hyperbolic examples satisfying the strong energy condition.
The charged C metric involves three parameters<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m, e</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> representing mass, charge and acceleration respectively. Using a method developed in a previous paper, we show that when<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>2</sup> ≤<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em><sup>2</sup> the metric may be interpreted in terms of two Reissner-Nordström particles, each of mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and with charges +<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> and −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>, in accelerated motion and connected by a spring. The method depends on the fact that for certain regions of the coordinate space the charged C metric may be transformed into the Weyl form for a static axisymmetric system. In this form the horizons of the C metric become line sources. One of the regions leads to a Weyl metric with two line sources, one of finite length which corresponds to the outer horizon of a Reissner-Nordström particle and the other semi-infinite corresponding to a horizon associated with uniform accelerated motion. A further coordinate transformation leads to a metric valid for a larger region of space-time in which there are two charged particles in accelerated motion. When<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Am</em> is small, the electromagnetic invariants approximate to those for the Born field for two accelerated charges in special relativity.
Killing pairs are investigated under the assumption that one member of the pair is a known recurrent vector field. This reduces the equation determining the other member of the pair to a linear equation. The conditions for such a Killing pair to exist are obtained for a well known class of spacetimes admitting a recurrent vector field.
The field equations in the nonsymmetric gravitational theory are derived from a Lagrangian density using a first-order formalism. Using the general covariance of the Lagrangian density, conservation laws and tensor identities are derived. Among these are the generalized Bianchi identities and the law of energy-momentum conservation. The Lagrangian density is expanded to second-order, and treated as an “Einstein plus fields” theory. From this, it is deduced that the energy is positive in the radiation zone.
The mathematical approach to General Relativity insists that all coordinate systems are equal. However physicists and astrophysicists in fact almost always use preferred coordinate systems not merely to simplify the calculations but also to help define quantities of physical interest. This suggests we should reconsider and perhaps refine the dogma of General Covariance.


Doppler tracking of an interplanetary spacecraft provides an unique opportunity to search for low frequency gravitational waves. In this paper, we describe in detail how Doppler experiments can be used to set an upper limit on a stochastic gravitational background, isotropically distributed. After reviewing the basic equations involved in this technique, we critically analyze three methods of data analysis, based on different assumptions about the physical properties of the signal.
We consider the Denisov-Solov'ov example which shows that the inertial mass is not well defined in General Relativity. It is shown that the mathematical reason why this is true is a wrong application of the Stokes theorem. Then we discuss the role of the order of asymptotically flatness in the definition of the mass. In conclusion some comments on conservation laws in General Relativity are presented.
A twenty-dimensional space of charged solutions of spin-2 equations is proposed. The relation with extended (via dilatation) Poincaré group is analyzed. Locally, each solution of the theory may be described in terms of a potential, which can be interpreted as a metric tensor satisfying linearized Einstein equations. Globally, the nonsingular metric tensor exists if and only if 10 among the above 20 charges do vanish. The situation is analogous to that in classical electrodynamics, where vanishing of magnetic monopole implies the global existence of the electromagnetic potentials. The notion of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">asymptotic conformal Yano-Killing tensor</em> is defined and used as a basic concept to introduce an inertial frame in General Relativity via asymptotic conditions at spatial infinity. The introduced class of asymptotically flat solutions is free of supertranslation ambiguities.
We investigate stochastic gravity as a potentially fruitful avenue for studying quantum effects in gravity. Following the approach of stochastic electrodynamics (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">sed</span>), as a representation of the quantum gravity vacuum we construct a classical state of isotropic random gravitational radiation, expressed as a spin-2 field,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">µυ</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>), composed of plane waves of random phase on a flat spacetime manifold. Requiring Lorentz invariance leads to the result that the spectral composition function of the gravitational radiation,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h(ω)</em>, must be proportional to 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em><sup>2</sup>. The proportionality constant is determined by the Planck condition that the energy density consist of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ħω</em>/2 per normal mode, and this condition sets the amplitude scale of the random gravitational radiation at the order of the Planck length, giving a spectral composition function<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h(ω)</em> =<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">√16πc</em><sup>2</sup>L<sub>p</sub>/ω<sup>2</sup>. As an application of stochastic gravity, we investigate the Davies-Unruh effect. We calculate the two-point correlation function (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>iojo</sub>(O<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δτ</em>/2)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>kolo</sub>(O,τ+δτ/2)) of the measureable geodesic deviation tensor field,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sub>iojo</sub>, for two situations: (i) at a point detector uniformly accelerating through the random gravitational radiation, and (ii) at an inertial detector in a heat bath of the random radiation at a finite temperature. We find that the two correlation functions agree to first order in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aδτ/c</em> provided that the temperature and acceleration satisfy the relation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kT=ħa/2πc</em>.
We provide physical interpretation for the four parameters of the stationary Lewis metric restricted to the Weyl class. Matching this spacetime to a completely anisotropic, rigidly rotating, fluid cylinder, we obtain from the junction conditions that one of these parameters is proportional to the vorticity of the source. From the Newtonian approximation a second parameter is found to be proportional to the energy per unit of length. The remaining two parameters may be associated to a gravitational analog of the Aharanov-Bohm effect. We prove, using the Cartan scalars, that the Weyl class metric and static Levi-Civita metric are locally equivalent, i.e., indistinguishable in terms of its curvature.
We investigate the role of the torsion field at the quantum level. One-loop counterterms are calculated in the theory with terms quadratic in the torsion field. We have shown that the theory is finite at the one-loop level.
A general covariant conservation law of energy-momentum in complex general relativity is obtained by way of general displacement transformation in terms of Ashtekar's new variables. The energy is exactly the adm Hamiltonian on the constraint surface on condition that an appropriate time function is chosen. The energy-momentum is gauge covariant and commutes with all the constraints whence they are physical observables. Furthermore, the Poisson brackets of the momentum and the internal<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) charges form a 3-Poincaré algebra.
A class of plane symmetric solutions containing dust is considered. It is argued that, however inhomogeneous the mass distribution, matter on each plane of symmetry has no net attraction to matter on other planes.

We point out that spacetime singularities play a useful role in gravitational theories by eliminating unphysical solutions. In particular, we argue that any modification of general relativity which is completely nonsingular cannot have a stable ground state. This argument applies both to classical extensions of general relativity, and to candidate quantum theories of gravity.
Dwivedi and Joshi (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">dj</span>) [2] have demonstrated the occurrence of a strong curvature naked singularity in the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous dust. In a recent paper Unnikrishnan (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u</span>) [8] has claimed that demonstrations such as these are unphysical. According to<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u, dj</span> arrived at a strong naked singularity because they started the collapse of the cloud from an infinite central density. We show, by means of an explicit demonstration, that this claim of<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u</span> is incorrect. In fact, the strong naked singularity arises from a regular initial density profile which has the form<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ(R)=ρ</em><sub>0</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">+ρ</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">3</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">3</em> </sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">+O(R</em><sup>4</sup>) near the center, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em><sub>0</sub> is the initial central density and is finite.<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u</span> has missed out on these density profiles, thereby leading to his erroneous conclusion. We also note that in his paper<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u</span> has given no proof either of the nakedness of the singularity, or of its strength. Thus his claims, besides being wrong, are not based on any mathematical derivation. We also point out other serious mistakes in that paper. In summary,<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">u</span> has no valid mathematical or physical objection to the work of Dwivedi and Joshi.
We examine gravitational waves in an isolated axi-symmetric reflexion symmetric system in the framework of the Nonsymmetric Gravitational Theory (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ngt</span>). The vacuum field equations are analyzed and the exact solution for the field variables in the metric tensor are found in the form of expansions in powers of a radial coordinate. We find that when the system radiates, the mass decreases monotonically and the energy flux associated with waves is positive.
We give here the general parametric representation of elliptic and hyperbolic matter-radiation universes. This permits us to eliminate two of the three possible cases for hyperbolic models because they are not compatible with the observations.
It is shown that there is no violation of the strong principle of equivalence in the case of an electric charge either falling freely or supported in a static uniform gravitational field. For a freely falling charge, the global electromagnetic field distribution at any instant is found to be the same as that of a charge which is moving uniformly with respect to an inertial frame with a velocity equal to the instantaneous velocity of the freely falling charge. In the case of a charge supported in the gravitational field, the total electromagnetic field energy, as measured by freely falling observers instantaneously at rest with respect to the charge, is shown to be equal to the Coulomb field energy of a charge permanently stationary in an inertial frame. The conclusion here, that in neither of the two cases does the charge emit electromagnetic radiation, is independent of our choice of the observer's frame of reference.
Many metric theories of gravitation can be transformed into general relativity with matter fields. We consider the circumstances under which such a transformation may be used to study the singularity structure (where in this context, singularities are characterised by incomplete causal geodesics).
An equation of spinor algebra, which is specified by two positive integers,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, is solved by relating it to the problem of integrating a two-dimensional Hamiltonian homogeneous polynomial system of ordinary differential equations, whose degree is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N}</em>-1. The case in which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1 reduces to a well-known result of spinor algebra. The case<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M=N</em>=4 is of relevance in the study of symmetry operators of Maxwell's equations on a curved space-time. It is also shown, using spinor notation, that the first integral for a general two-dimensional Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations (whether polynomial or analytic) is determinable in a purely algebraic manner, i.e., by using no integration.
An interesting static spherically symmetric solution corresponding to Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a dilaton field with negative kinetic term has been obtained. This solution is characterized by the set of two arbitrary parameters, the physical mass<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Μ</em><sub>0</sub> and electric charge<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>. It has two horizons on which the metric, scalar curvature and both dilaton and electromagnetic fields are regular. Another feature of this solution is that the physical mass is bounded by the electric charge as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Μ</em><sub>0</sub>≥√2¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>¦ (unlike the Reisner-Nordström solution for which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Μ</em><sub>0</sub>&gt;-¦<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>¦). The structure of the scalar curvature has been analyzed.
Three propositions about Jordan matrices are proved and applied to algebraically classify the Ricci tensor in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional Kaluza-Klein-type spacetimes. We show that the possible Segre types are [1, 1... 1], [21 ... 1], [31 ... 1], [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z¯z</em>1 ... 1] and degeneracies thereof. A set of canonical forms for the Segre types is obtained in terms of semi-null bases of vectors.
The abstract quantum algebra of observables for 2+1 gravity is analysed in the limit of small cosmological constant. The algebra splits into two sets with an explicit phase space representation; one set consists of 6g−6<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">commuting</em> elements which form a basis for an algebraic manifold defined by the trace and rank identities; the other set consists of 6g−6 tangent vectors to this manifold. The action of the quantum mapping class group leaves the algebra and algebraic manifold invariant. The previously presented representation for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>=2 is analysed in this limit and reduced to a very simple form. The symplectic form for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>=2 is computed.


The static black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations are all spherically symmetric, as are many of the recently discovered black hole solutions in theories of gravity coupled to other forms of matter. However, counterexamples demonstrating that static black holes need not be spherically symmetric exist in theories, such as the standard electroweak model, with electrically charged massive vector fields. In such theories, a magnetically charged Reissner-Nordström solution with sufficiently small horizon radius is unstable against the development of a nonzero vector field outside the horizon. General arguments show that, for generic values of the magnetic charge, this field cannot be spherically symmetric. Explicit construction of the solution shows that it in fact has no rotational symmetry at all.
The study of anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation is progressing at a phenomenal rate, both experimentally and theoretically. These anisotropies can teach us an enormous amount about the way that fluctuations were generated and the way they subsequently evolved into the clustered galaxies which are observed today. In particular, on sub-degree scales the rich structure in the anisotropy spectrum is the consequence of gravity-driven acoustic oscillations occurring before the matter in the universe became neutral. The frozen-in phases of these sound waves imprint a dependence on many cosmological parameters, that we may be on the verge of extracting.
The earliest phase of cosmological evolution is studied in a universe where spin-generated torsion effects are important. The evolution of the scale factor is studied in cosmologies with a Robertson-Walker line element and a spin density aligned in the radial direction (±<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>). Solutions are found for the cases of stiff matter, radiation, pressureless matter and decompressive matter admitting a spin density.
We consider a 5D Kaluza-Klein type cosmological model with the fifth coordinate being a generalization of the invariant “historical” time<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em> of the covariant theory of Horwitz and Piron. We distinguish between vacuum-, off-shell matter-, and on-shell matter-dominated eras as the solutions of the corresponding 5D gravitational field equations, and build an inflationary scenario according to which passage from the off-shell matter-dominated era to the on-shell one occurs, probably as a phase transition. We study the effect of this phase transition on the expansion rate in both cases of local<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(4,1) and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(3,2) invariance of the extended (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup>µ</sup>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em>) manifold and show that it does not change in either case. The expansion of the model we consider is not adiabatic; the thermodynamic entropy is a growing function of cosmic time for the closed universe, and can be a growing function of historical time for the open and the flat universe. A complete solution of the 5D gravitational field equations is obtained for the on-shell matter-dominated universe. The open and the closed universe are shown to tend asymptotically to the standard 4D cosmological models, in contrast to the flat universe which does not have the corresponding limit. Finally, possible cosmological implications are briefly discussed.
We discuss in detail the differences between two different definitions of energy, within a slowly evolving distribution of fluid. The conspicuous role played by the Weyl and shear tensors and their relationship with the inhomogeneity and the anisotropy of the fluid are brought out.
We define the “meta”-rigid motions as particular classes of time-like congruences which are solutions of intrinsically defined partial differential equations that generalize Born's conditions. We consider in particular two hierarchies of such congruences. The first one is a geometrically motivated direct generalization of the symmetry concept inherent in Born congruences. The second one is an indirect generalization based on the conditions which guarantee the existence of a particular class of adapted coordinates of space, named quo-harmonic coordinates, whose definition is akin to the definition of harmonic coordinates but which differs from it in an essential point.
Considering irrotational pressure free matter, conditions are obtained under which an orthonormal tetrad simultaneously diagonalizes the shear tensor and the electric part of the Weyl tensor. It is shown that such a frame also diagonalises the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor. Using this principal tetrad we show that there are no consistent solutions for irrotational dust with a purely magnetic Weyl tensor.
Inflationary cosmology predicts the generation of both density perturbation and relic gravitons. Tests of these predictions, especially the relic gravitons, will be crucial to the verification of inflation. Efforts have been made to distinguish different inflation models using observed anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. However, the fact that both scalar and tensor modes contribute to the Sachs-Wolfe effect renders such determination difficult. We point out that, mediated by the primordial magnetic field, the relic gravitons can resonantly convert into photons at the same frequencies. Measurement of the spectrum of these long wavelength EM waves can help to determine the power law index directly, which will distinguish different inflationary models. This opens up a new window for another glance at “gravity's rainbow”.
A diverse set of observations now compellingly suggest that the universe possesses a nonzero cosmological constant. In the context of quantum-field theory a cosmological constant corresponds to the energy density of the vacuum, and the favored value for the cosmological constant corresponds to a very tiny vacuum energy density. We discuss future observational tests for a cosmological constant as well as the fundamental theoretical challenges — and opportunities — that this poses for particle physics and for extending our understanding of the evolution of the universe back to the earliest moments.
Along with the presentation of some interesting new analytic solutions, the dynamics of slowly rotating radiating perfect fluid universes coupled with a scalar field are investigated, and their physical and geometrical properties are studied from various angles. The rotational perturbations of such models are examined in detail in order to substantiate the possibility that the universe is endowed with some rotation. The nature and role of the metric rotation which is related to the local dragging of inertial frames and that of the matter rotation are studied. The effects of the radiation and the scalar fields on the rotation are discussed. The periods of physical validity for some of the models and the restrictions on the radii of the models for real astrophysical situations are found. Most of the rotating models obtained here turn out to be expanding ones as well, and may be taken as good examples of real astrophysical objects in this universe.
Equations of motion for an anisotropic nonlinear elastic continuum in the gravitational field are written in a form convenient for numerical calculations. The energy-stress tensor is expressed through scalar and tensor products of three vectors imbedded in the continuum. Examples of expansion of the energy-stress tensor into scalar and tensor invariants corresponding to some crystal classes are given.
A measurement theory for the temperature of relativistic systems is developed. The resulting operational approach is shown to be quasi-local and therefore may be applicable in general Riemannian manifolds even when there are temperature gradients which induce heat flows. The surprising feature of our analysis is that it leads to a bifurcation of the temperature concept into two distinctly different measurable quantities: one a frame invariant scalar field which a local co-moving observer would tend to identify with the local temperature and employ in the definition of entropy, the other a frame dependent, but nevertheless locally determinable quantity which governs the flow of heat and the ability to extract work. The two quantities differ by the bookkeeping methodology employed to calibrate the thermometer. A simple relationship between the two temperatures can be established if a preferred Killing vector field is available in the Riemannian manifold.
The Einstein field equations of massive strings are solved completely with and without a source free magnetic field for the Bianchi type I metric in a different basic form. Some physical properties of the models are studied.
The gravitational interaction between grooves machined in a hollow cylindrical mass of uniform density, and an external point mass, is derived in terms of the Associated Legendre functions, and the parametric form of the coupling coefficients is presented. The cross-sections of the grooves, which are regularly spaced in azimuth, are in the form of truncated sectors of the cylinder's end-faces. This theory is applied to the test-masses for the Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP) experiment, for which four grooves have been assumed, and an expression for the axialforce is derived which is more than 10<sup>4</sup> times faster to compute than a Monte-Carlo integration of similar accuracy. Following this analysis it is suggested that the STEP test-masses should carry at least 6 grooves. This theory has wider application to gravitational problems involving general sectored cylindrical bodies.
On the basis of Killing vectors, a systematic method for solving Bäcklund transformations of the Euler equation in the harmonic mapping theory is presented. As an application, the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetrical gravitation is discussed, and the Ehler transformation of that equation is obtained.
We study the problem of a radiating source composed of a Dirac field with cylindrical symmetry.
The entropy of a self-gravitating radiation system (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">sgrs</span>) confined to a spherical box with a central black hole is calculated by using the equation of state of radiation near a black-hole horizon, which was derived by Li and Liu. The upper bound on the total entropy of the system including the central black hole is exactly equal to the entropy of the black hole with the same mass. A reasonable mode of the gravitational collapse of an<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">sgrs</span> is given, and a possible explanation for the origin of black-hole entropy is provided.
A Lagrangian formulation for an Einstein-Cartan-Proca unified field theory of gravity and massive electrodynamics is presented.
Space-times which allow a slicing into homogeneous spatial hypersurfaces generalize the usual Bianchi models. One knows already that in these models the Bianchi type may change with time. Here we show which of the changes really appear. To this end we characterize the topological space whose points are the 3-dimensional oriented homogeneous Riemannian manifolds; locally isometric manifolds are considered as identical.
We present a new dynamical calculation about the Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe considered as an autonomous Hamiltonian. The time evolution of this Hamiltonian presents numerical instabilities so we apply a symplectic integration via infinitesimal canonical transformations of the phase space time evolution that preserves the Poincaré invariant. In this way, we have also obtained a sensitive improvement in the accuracy of the Hamiltonian constraint, as well as in the computing time. We confirm our previous results; in a spatially closed universe, the route to chaos is reached by sucessive breakage of the resonant tori due to the action of 1∶1 resonances.
In the R+<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>R<sup>2</sup> gravity theory, we show that if freely propagating massless particles have an almost isotropic distribution, then the spacetime is almost Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">frw</span>). This extends the result proved recently in general relativity (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> = 0), which is applicable to the microwave background after photon decoupling. The higher-order result is in principle applicable to a massless species that decouples in the early universe, such as a relic graviton background. Any future observations that show small anisotropies in such a background would imply that the geometry of the early universe were almost<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">frw</span>.
It is shown, by a simple argument, that in any {2 2} (i.e. type D) vacuum space-time, the complex component of the Weyl curvature (spinor Ψ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">abcd</em>) along any light ray is precisely proportional to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em><sup>−5</sup>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> is the standard Schwarzschild radial coordinate, or its natural complex generalization for the arbitrary {2 2} case.


The Einstein-Schrödinger purely affine field theory of the non-symmetric field provides canonical field equations without constraints. These equations imply the Heisenberg-Pauli commutation rules of quantum field theory. In the Schrödinger gauging of the Einstein field coordinates<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em><span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kl</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> </span>=Γ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kl</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> </span>−δ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sup> </span>Γ<span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">km</em> </sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sup> </span>, this unified geometric field theory becomes a model of the coupling between a quantized Maxwellian field in a medium and classical gravity. Therefore, independently of the question as to the physical truth of this model, its analysis performed in the present paper demonstrates that, in the framework of a quantized unified field theory, gravity can appear as a genuinely classical field.
On the basis of the general class of solutions of 6D vacuum Einstein equations and using well-known results of the 6D geometric model of electroweak and gravitational interactions, the variations of fundamental physical constants and their influence on the observed red-shift of galaxies are investigated. By considering the interpretation of extra components of the 6D metric as reproducing the properties of matter in the 4D curved space-time, the effective quantities of matter are obtained. In particular, the states of dust and radiation are shown. The corresponding 5D models were also investigated.
The paper consists of some exact tilted solutions for a homogeneous Bianchi type VI<sub>0</sub> universe. The material distribution is taken to be a stiff fluid with heat conduction. The physical and kinematical parameters have also been calculated to discuss the models in detail.
The integrability properties of the field equation<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">xx</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(x)L</em><sup>2</sup> of a spherically symmetric shear-free fluid are investigated. A first integral, subject to an integrability condition on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(x)</em>, is found, giving a new class of solutions which contains the solutions of Stephani and Srivastava as special cases. The integrability condition on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(x)</em> is reduced to a quadrature which is expressible in terms of elliptic integrals in general. There are three classes of solution and in general the solution of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">xx</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(x)L</em><sup>2</sup> can only be written in parametric form. The case for which<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F=F(x)</em> can be explicitly given corresponds to the solution of Stephani. A Lie analysis of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">xx</em> </sub>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F(x)L</em><sup>2</sup> is also performed. If a constant α vanishes, then the solutions of Kustaanheimo and Qvist and of this paper are regained. For α ≠ 0 we reduce the problem to a simpler, autonomous equation. The applicability of the Painlevé analysis is also briefly considered.
In this paper a theory of models of the universe is proposed. We refer to such models as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cosmological models</em>, where a cosmological model is defined as an Einstein-inextendible Einstein spacetime. A cosmological model is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absolute</em> if it is a Lorentz-inextendible Einstein spacetime,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">predictive</em> if it is globally hyperbolic, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-predictive</em> if it is nonglobally-hyperbolic. We discuss several features of these models in the study of cosmology. As an example, any compact Einstein spacetime is always a non-predictive absolute cosmological model, whereas a noncompact complete Einstein spacetime is an absolute cosmological model which may be either predictive or non-predictive. We discuss the important role played by maximal Einstein spacetimes. In particular, we examine the possible proper Lorentz-extensions of such spacetimes, and show that a spatially compact maximal Einstein spacetime is exclusively either a predictive cosmological model or a proper sub-spacetime of a non-predictive cosmological model. Provided that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture is true, a generic spatially compact maximal Einstein spacetime must be a predictive cosmological model. It is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conjectured</em> that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> true, and converting a vice to a virtue it is argued that the failure of the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture would point to what may be general relativity's greatest prediction of all, namely,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">that general relativity predicts that general relativity cannot predict the entire history of the universe</em>.
Using an equivalence theorem, we discuss some stationary interiors for a string with spin density in a space with torsion. We show that there is a family of solutions characterized by the spin divergences and compare the solutions to string solutions in general relativistic spacetimes.
We propose a new method of gravitational wave detection in the 10<sup>−1</sup>÷ 10<sup>−2</sup>Hz band for a space laboratory based on the use of the Kozorez effect in the magnetic interaction of superconducting solenoids.
We study the form of topology changing amplitudes within the Regge calculus approach to four-dimensional gravity. The four-dimensional simplicial complex is chosen to be a cone over the disjoint union of a number of topologically distinct lens spaces. By restricting attention to a simplicial minisuperspace, the analytic properties of the Regge action can be identified explicitly. The classical extrema and convergent steepest descent contours defining these amplitudes are determined, and a factorization property is established. In the cases studied, we find ground state wave functions which predict Lorentzian oscillatory behaviour in the late universe.
The issue concerning the existence of wormhole states in locally supersymmetric minisuperspace models with matter is addressed. Wormhole states are apparently absent in models obtained from the more general theory of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>=1 supergravity with supermatter. A Hartle-Hawking type solution can be found, even though some terms (which are scalar field dependent) cannot be determined in a satisfactory way. A possible cause is investigated here. As far as the wormhole situation is concerned, we argue here that the type of Lagrange multipliers and fermionic derivative ordering used can make a difference. A proposal is made for supersymmetric quantum wormholes to also be invested with a Hilbert space structure, associated with a maximal analytical extension of the corresponding minisuperspace.
For a large class of spherically symmetric gravitational fields, when matter is dropped in a spherically symmetric way, it is possible to decompose this matter into free-falling shells such that their associated 2+1-dimensional (i.e. surface) energy-momentum tensor is conserved, that is, is not affected by the environment. Further ‘non-interacting’ features can be found for this class of gravitational fields as can be seen by the fact that Einstein's equations are linear in this case. Matter of a shell falling in one of these fields obeys energy momentum conservation from the point of view of the 2+1-dimensional world-sheet of the shell. This means that in the case of a test particle moving in one of these free falling sheets, the motion follows a 2+1-dimensional geodesic equation, or what is the same, its dynamics is governed by a ‘sphereland equivalence principle’. As a result of this, a shell falling in such a gravitational field can be treated as a closed system which can be described by a 2+1-dimensionally defined Hamiltonian.
We give an exact solution of the five-dimensional relativity equations, and interpret it using the induced-matter formalism wherein geometry in 5D gives rise to matter in 4D. The solution represents oscillations of ordinary 3D space where the associated medium has the equation of state of the classical de Sitter vacuum. We outline implications for the inflationary universe model.
We investigate the double duality ansatz of the Poincaré gauge theory of gravitation. It is shown that many known exact solutions belong, as special cases, to larger families of solutions. These families of solutions include several arbitrary functions and can be generated by a transformation which is a Lorentzian rotation of the connection with fixed tetrad. Several new spherically symmetric and wavelike exact solution are presented.
We determine the large class of Robertson-Walker spacetimes whose first-order, linear, isentropic perturbations can be expressed in closed form, and the closed form perturbations are written down. It is shown that the class includes several well-known spacetimes including, for example, spatially flat dust and the radiation filled universe.
In General Relativity a body is said to be rigid when it suffers no deformations, namely when the relative acceleration of any pair of its neighbouring elements vanishes identically. Here we apply this criterion to a system orbiting a Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole and calculate the strains which the body has to sustain in order to avoid deformation. We then discuss the relations between our results and the physical measurements which can be performed in orbiting frames and find that the only measurement of strains leads to ambiguous information.
We generalise the equations governing relativistic fluid dynamics given by Ehlers and Ellis for general relativity, and by Maartens and Taylor for quadratic theories, to generalised<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)</em> theories of gravity. In view of the usefulness of this alternative framework to general relativity, its generalisation can be of potential importance for deriving analogous results to those obtained in general relativity. We generalise, as an example, the results of Maartens and Taylor to show that within the framework of general<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)</em> theories, a perfect fluid spacetime with vanishing vorticity, shear and acceleration is Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker only if the fluid has in addition a barotropic equation of state. It then follows that the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs theorem and its “almost” extension also hold for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)</em> theories of gravity.
A program is outlined which addresses the problem of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">reduction of Einstein's equations</em>, namely, that of writing Einstein's vacuum equations in (3+1)-dimensions as an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unconstrained</em> dynamical system where the variables are the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">true degrees of freedom</em> of the gravitational field. Our analysis is applicable for globally hyperbolic Ricci-flat spacetimes that admit constant mean curvature compact orientable spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces M with deg<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>=0 and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> not diffeomorphic to<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sub>6</sub>, the underlying manifold of a certain compact orientable flat affine 3-manifold. We find that for these spacetimes, modulo the extended Poincaré conjecture and the use of local cross-sections rather than a global cross-section, (3+1)-reduction can be completed much as in the (2+1)-dimensional case. In both cases, one gets as the reduced phase space the cotangent bundle<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>*</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Teichmüller space T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">of conformal structures</em> on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is a given initial constant mean curvature compact orientable spacelike Cauchy hypersurface in a spacetime (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V, g</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> </sub>), and one gets reduction of the full classical non-reduced Hamiltonian system with constraints to a reduced Hamiltonian system without constraints on<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sup>*</sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub>. For these reduced systems, the time parameter is the parameter of a family of monotonically increasing constant mean curvature compact orientable spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces in a neighborhood of a given initial one. In the (2+1)-dimensional case, the Hamiltonian is the area functional of these hypersurfaces, and in the (3+1)-dimensional case, the Hamiltonian is the volume functional of these hypersurfaces.
For a compact connected orientable<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-manifold<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M, n</em> ≥ 3, we study the structure of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classical superspace</em><span class="InlineEquation" id="IE1">\(\mathcal{S} \equiv {\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} \mathcal{D}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{D}}\)</span>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quantum superspace</em><span class="InlineEquation" id="IE2">\(\mathcal{S}_0 \equiv {\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} {\mathcal{D}_0 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {\mathcal{D}_0 }}\)</span>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classical conformal superspace</em><span class="InlineEquation" id="IE3">\(\mathcal{C} \equiv {{\left( {{\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} \mathcal{P}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{P}}} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left( {{\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} \mathcal{P}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{P}}} \right)} \mathcal{D}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{D}}\)</span>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quantum conformal superspace</em><span class="InlineEquation" id="IE4">\(\mathcal{C}_0 \equiv {{\left( {{\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} \mathcal{P}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{P}}} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left( {{\mathcal{M} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\mathcal{M} \mathcal{P}}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \mathcal{P}}} \right)} {\mathcal{D}_0 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {\mathcal{D}_0 }}\)</span>. The study of the structure of these spaces is motivated by questions involving reduction of the usual canonical Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity to a non-degenerate Hamiltonian formulation, and to questions involving the quantization of the gravitational field. We show that if the degree of symmetry of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is zero, then<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S,S</em><sub>0</sub>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>, and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>0</sub> are<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ilh</span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">orbifolds</em>. The case of most importance for general relativity is dimension<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>=3. In this case, assuming that the extended Poincaré conjecture is true, we show that quantum superspace<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>0</sub> and quantum conformal superspace<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>0</sub> are in fact<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ilh</span>-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">manifolds</em>. If, moreover,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is a Haken manifold, then quantum superspace and quantum conformal superspace are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">contractible</em><span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ilh</span>-manifolds. In this case, there are no Gribov ambiguities for the configuration spaces<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em><sub>0</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>0</sub>. Our results are applicable to questions involving the problem of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">reduction of Einstein's vacuum equations</em> and to problems involving quantization of the gravitational field. For the problem of reduction, one searches for a way to reduce the canonical Hamiltonian formulation together with its constraint equations to an unconstrained Hamiltonian system on a reduced phase space. For the problem of quantum gravity, the space<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sub>0</sub> will play a natural role in any quantization procedure based on the use of conformal methods and the reduced Hamiltonian formulation.
We consider quantum effects of an electromagnetic field in a radiation-dominated almost<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">frw</span> spacetime. The dominant non-local quantum correction to the photon distribution is a quadrupole moment, corresponding to an effective anisotropic pressure in the energy-momentum tensor.

It is shown that it is sufficient to solve a single first order differential equation to determine exact Bianchi type V imperfect fluid solutions of Einstein's field equations. Two exact solutions are presented in this paper. One of these two solutions corresponds to the case when the anisotropic pressure tensor is proportional to the shear tensor. This proportionality, it is shown, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the absence of heat flow in a Bianchi type V universe. It is also observed that the presence of heat flow necessarily introduces anisotropy in a Bianchi type V universe.
As almost any S-matrix of quantum theory possesses a set of complex poles (or branch cuts), it is shown using one example that this is the case in quantum field theory in curved space-time. These poles can be transformed into complex eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenvectors being Gamow vectors. This formalism, which is heuristic in ordinary Hilbert space, becomes a rigorous one within the framework of a properly chosen rigged Hilbert space. Then complex eigenvalues produce damping or growing factors and a typical two semigroups structure. It is known that the growth of entropy, decoherence, and the appearance of correlations, occur in the universe evolution, but this fact is demonstrated only under a restricted set of initial conditions. It is proved that the damping factors are mathematical tools that allow one to enlarge the set.
We present a solution to the gravitational field equations which describes either a static disc in general relativity or a spin polarized rotating disc in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime. The disc has infinite radius and finite thickness. The energy and pressure are finite and positive within the disc and for some parameter choices, a radial fall off in the fluid parameters is possible. A comparison is made to axis-symmetric wall solutions.
A discussion of Ricci and matter collineations (mainly the former) is presented. A mathematical description of their dimensionality, differentiability, extendibility etc. is given. Examples of Ricci collineations are constructed particularly in decomposable space-times.
Perfect fluid space-times admitting a three-dimensional Lie group of conformal motions containing a two-dimensional Abelian Lie subgroup of isometries are studied. Demanding that the conformal Killing vector be proper (i.e., not homothetic nor Killing), all such space-times are classified according to the structure of their corresponding three-dimensional conformal Lie group and the nature of their corresponding orbits (that are assumed to be non-null). Each metric is then explicitly displayed in coordinates adapted to the symmetry vectors. Attention is then restricted to the diagonal case, and exact perfect fluid solutions are obtained in both the cases in which the fluid four-velocity is tangential or orthogonal to the conformal orbits, as well as in the more general “tilting” case.
A brief review of a first order theory with a quadratic Lagrangian<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>=<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>+Ω<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup> is presented. It is shown that a test particle follows a geodesic of the metric connection. The theory behaves in the Newtonian limit as the Newtonian theory with a correction which is proportional to the matter density at the field point. This behavior can be produced by a Yukawa potential with an atomic scale characteristic range<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> and a coupling constant<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> proportional to 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em><sup>2</sup>. This type of potential is not excluded by the present experimental data.
Once the action for Einstein's equations is rewritten as a functional of an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3, ℂ) connection and a conformal factor of the metric, it admits a family of “neighbours” having the same number of degrees of freedom and a precisely defined metric tensor. This paper analyzes the relation between the Riemann tensor of that metric and the curvature tensor of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) connection. The relation is very complicated in general. The Einstein case is distinguished by the fact that two natural<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) metrics on the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GL</em>(3) fibres coincide. In the general case the theory is bimetric on the fibres.
We argue that General Relativistic solutions can always be locally embedded in Ricci-flat 5-dimensional spaces. This is a direct consequence of a theorem of Campbell (given here for both a timelike and spacelike extra dimension, together with a special case of this theorem) which guarantees that any<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be locally embedded in an (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1)-dimensional Ricci-flat Riemannian manifold. This is of great importance in establishing local generality for a proposal recently put forward and developed by Wesson and others, whereby vacuum (4+1)-dimensional field equations give rise to (3+1)-dimensional equations with sources. An important feature of Campbell's procedure is that it automatically guarantees the compatibility of Gauss-Codazzi equations and therefore allows the construction of embeddings to be in principle always possible. We employ this procedure to construct such embeddings in a number of simple cases.

We develop the analogue of the law of equipartition of energy for relativistic systems and examine some of its consequences. For mixtures of special relativistic ideal gases of different rest masses we find that the energy gets partitioned in an unexpected way, the ultra-relativistic component taking essentially twice as much energy per degree of freedom as the more massive non-relativistic component. This conclusion may have an application when considering thermalized photons in the interior of the sun. With an eye toward the possible extension of our considerations to general relativity, we show that, in the presence of a distinguished time-like Killing field, the global parameter which characterized the equilibrium state of an ideal gas can be determined by local measurements employing a suitably calibrated thermometer.
In 1991 Gott presented a solution of Einstein's field equations in 2+1 dimensions with λ=0 that contained closed timelike curves (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ctc</span>'s). This solution was remarkable because at first it did not seem to be unphysical in any other respect. Later, however, it was shown that Gott's solution is tachyonic in a certain sense. Here the case λ&lt;0 is discussed. We show that it is also possible to construct<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ctc</span>'s in this case, in a way analogous to that used by Gott. We also show a special case of this construction to be tachyonic. λ&lt;0 means that we are dealing with anti-de Sitter space, and since the CTC-construction necessitates some understanding of its structure, a few pages are devoted to this subject.
In the framework of the weak stationary gravitational field and low velocity, we investigate the gravitomagnetic effects on a superconductor. We show that we have no gravitomagnetic shielding, and thus no generalized Meissner gravitational effect in superconductors.
In many metrics of physical interest, the gravitational field can be represented as an optical medium with an effective index of refraction. We show that, in such a metric, the orbits of both massive and massless particles are governed by a variational principle which involves the index of refraction and which assumes the form of Fermat's principle or of Maupertuis's principle. From this variational principle we derive exact equations of motion of Newtonian form which govern both massless and massive particles. These equations of motion are applied to some problems of physical interest.
We investigate if there is any inertial dragging effect associated with vacuum energy. Spacetime inside and outside a rotating thin shell, as well as the mechanical properties of the shell, are analyzed by means of Israel's general relativistic theory of surface layers. Our investigation generalizes that of Brill and Cohen, who found vacuum-solutions of Einstein's field equations (with vanishing cosmological constant), inside and outside a rotating shell. We include a nonvanishing vacuum-energy inside the shell. It is found that the inertial dragging angular velocity increases with increasing density of vacuum energy.
A concept of canonical connection of a Finsler metric is developed. Connections that are compatible with Finsler metrics are compared with the canonical connection itself. They are also compared with the corresponding Cartan connection. A necessary and sufficient condition on metric Finsler connections is given for the metric to be Riemannian. This study unearths different ways in which Finsler geometry could be used to generalize the theory of general relativity.
A 6D Space-Time-Mass-Charge (STMC) Theory is taken to see how far the physical properties of the 4D Space-Time Universe can be explained by the geometrical quantities of the extra dimensions. The equation of state for the macroscopic bodies is obtained, and the general properties of the electromagnetic field can be studied.
Mixed invariants are used to classify the Riemann spinor in the case of Einstein-Maxwell fields and perfect fluids. In the Einstein-Maxwell case these mixed invariants provide information as to the relative orientation of the gravitational and electromagnetic principal null directions. Consideration of the perfect fluid case leads to some results about the behaviour of the Bel-Robinson tensor regarded as a quartic form on unit timelike vectors.
We calculate the Bogolubov coefficients for a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em><sup>(0)</sup> metric which describes the snapping of a cosmic string. In this background, we show that there are no<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">regular</em> solutions with particle interpretation, but we find a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">generalized solution</em> with integrable discontinuity, which exhibits particle creation. We also find a regular solution if we allow wave packets.
The 35-year-old problem of Møller's energy-momentum four-vector when transformed by a global Lorentz transformation is discussed again. It is argued that Møller's result is adequate from the viewpoint of general relativity and hence does not defeat his energy-momentum complex.
In the context of a null tetrad formalism it is assumed that the two real vectors of the tetrad have neither expansion nor rotation and that they are nongeodesic and/or have shear. This assumption is rarely used in search of algebraically special spacetimes. General relations for the connection and for the Ricci and Weyl tensors are presented. An additional assumption that these vectors are principal leads to Petrov type D spacetimes, reducible in some cases to conformally flat ones. Twenty-two explicit metric forms, probably hitherto unknown, are found.
A gauge theory of gravity with matter sources is investigated. In this theory the fundamental fields are the connections of a principal de Sitter fiber bundle, and the action is a quadratic form of the curvature as in the standard Yang-Mills theory, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is included. The Hamiltonian formulation and the constraint analysis of it is given. The separation of the self-dual and anti self-dual parts of the connection and curvature is exhibited.
We discuss the main cosmological implications of considering string-loop effects and a potential for the dilaton in the lowest order string effective action. Our framework is based on the effective model arising from regarding homogeneous and isotropic dilaton, metric and Yang-Mills field configurations. The issues of inflation, entropy crisis and the Polonyi problem as well as the problem of the cosmological constant are discussed.
In this paper we show that the combined action of particle decay and a physically motivated dissipative bulk stress can lead to a period of generalized inflation and temperature increase. This effect may have occurred at the baryogenesis era.
The stability of a quantum superposition of two different stationary mass distributions is examined, where the perturbing effect of each distribution on the space-time structure is taken into account, in accordance with the principles of general relativity. It is argued that the definition of the time-translation operator for the superposed space-times involves an inherent ill-definedness, leading to an essential uncertainty in the energy of the superposed state which, in the Newtonian limit, is proportional to the gravitational self-energy<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sub>Δ</sub> of the difference between the two mass distributions. This is consistent with a suggested finite lifetime of the order of ħ/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sub>Δ</sub> for the superposed state, in agreement with a certain proposal made by the author for a gravitationally induced spontaneous quantum state reduction, and with closely related earlier suggestions by Diósi and by Ghirardi<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">et al</em>.
Thick Einstein shells are composed of layers of particles that follow circular geodesics. They produce spacetimes that are static and spherically symmetric. In previous work the stress-energy tensor and particle number current were derived using heuristic arguments. Here, relativistic kinetic theory is used to derive these quantities, as well as the conserved entropy current, which was not given previously. We present two exact solutions for which everything from the metric to the entropy and particle number of the shells can be explicitly integrated.
The main features of continuous gravitational radiation bathing the Earth has been evaluated for a set of 558 pulsars. In particular, the maximum gravitational wave background and the maximum gravitational wave emission have been evaluated for each source and compared with the projected sensitivities of the planned Earth based very long baseline interferometric antennas for gravitational wave detection, like VIRGO and LIGO. This study shows that such detectors have a good chance of detecting gravitational waves emitted from this class of astrophysical sources.
We present a cosmological model in Kaluza-Klein spacetime with a matter field obeying an equation of state and a radial heat flow. The (3+1)space resembles that of a Robertson-Walker spacetime, but unlike the corresponding four-dimensional case our five-dimensional spacetime admits a radial flow of heat even when the three-space curvature remains a constant. Further our solution exhibits the desirable feature of dimensional reduction.

The coupling of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a conformal field in an arbitrary even dimension leads, after reduction to four dimensions, to the ordinary gravity coupled non-trivially to two scalar fields. The vacuum solutions display an initial singularity, but with an infinite proper distance between any two points of the space-time. There is an initial contraction phase followed by an expansion phase. This is a kind of ”anti-Big Bang” scenario. The coupling to a radiative fluid preserves this feature; however, the temperature of the radiative fluid is initially zero, increasing afterwards: its maximum value is related to the moment where the horizon crosses the radius of the Universe. The entropy in the three-dimensional space is inversely proportional to the volume of the internal space, and it can be very high today. We perform also a perturbative study of this model during the contraction phase. There is no explosive growth of the scalar perturbations.
It is shown that charged fluid distributions, matched to the Reissner-Nordström metric, may posses finite self-energy in the point particle limit if negative energy densities are allowed and the appropriate definition of bare mass is used. Several models are analyzed to illustrate the point.
The effect of a varying cosmological term and a dissipative bulk stress on the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe is investigated. In the cases of interest neither analytical nor qualitative analysis is feasible and so we study these numerically only. Our work extends that of Calvão et al. to bulk stresses not considered in their analysis.
Ricci and contracted Ricci collineations of the Bianchi type II, VIII, and IX space-times, associated with the vector fields of the form (i) one component of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup>) is different from zero and (ii) two components of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sup>) are different from zero, for<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a, b</em>=1, 2, 3, 4, are presented. In subcase (i.b), which is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>= (0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup>1</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>),0,0), some known solutions are found, and in subcase (i.d), which is<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>=(0, 0, 0,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em><sup>4</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>)), choosing<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S(t)</em> = const.×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R(t)</em>, the Bianchi type II, VIII, and IX spacetime is reduced to the Robertson-Walker metric.
Cosmological solutions of Einstein equation for a 5-dimensional space time, in the case of a dust-filled universe, are presented. With these solutions we are able to test a hypothetical relation between the rest mass of a particle and the 5th dimension. Comparison with experiment strongly refutes the implied dependence of the rest mass on the cosmological time.
The compacted spin coefficient (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ghp</span>) formalism is clearly more concise and efficient than the older Newman-Penrose formalism. Yet few people use it when integration of the field equations is involved, Held being the notable exception. However, to most workers in the field, Held's approach seems far removed from the usual Newman-Unti (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">nu</span>) type integration procedure. This paper and a subsequent one are concerned with integration within the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ghp</span> formalism. In this first paper we develop a<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ghp</span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">coordinate</em>-style integration procedure modelled closely on the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">nu</span> procedure whereas in the second paper we present a<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ghp</span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">operator</em>-style integration procedure along the lines suggested by Held. For simplicity of illustration we restrict the discussion to algebraically special vacuum spacetimes. We show clearly the similarities and differences between the two approaches, and compare their respective efficiencies. To deal with a concrete example, we illustrate the two methods by once more considering the problem of twisting type<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> vacuum solutions to Einstein's field equations. The<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Ghp</span> approach enables us to have a comprehensive overview of this much discussed problem and gain new insight into the relationship between various results derived in a number of different formalisms.
The collapse of a charged and radiating ball in the diffusion limit is studied using a method reported by Herrera and collaborators. The interior solution is matched with the exterior Reissner-Nordström-Vaidya metric to obtain a system of differential equations at the surface of the distribution, which can be integrated numerically for some set of initial data. For one model, the profiles of the physical variables are obtained at any piece of the material in terms of Schwarzschild-like coordinates.
The low energy effective Lagrangian of string theory presents us with not only gravity, but the dilaton and the antisymmetric field as well. It is shown that a Brans-Dicke generalization of a metric theory of gravity with torsion that is derived as the exterior derivative of a potential is equivalent to the low energy string theory Lagrangian. This gives all of the fields a physical interpretation in four dimensions and provides an indication that the dilaton represents<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">small</em> corrections to general relativity at large distances.
We present a general scheme for the nonlinear gauge realizations of spacetime groups on coset spaces of the groups considered. In order to show the relevance of the method for the rigorous treatment of the translations in gravitational gauge theories, we apply it in particular to the affine group. This is an illustration of the family of spacetime symmetries having the form of a semidirect product<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H ⊗ T</em>, where<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> is the stability subgroup and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> are the translations. The translational component of the connection behaves like a true tensor under<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> when coset realizations are involved.

Following Lake and Zannias we show that naked strong curvature singularities develop in Tolman-Bondi inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes for all the three cases of a bound, unbound and marginally bound gravitational collapse. It is observed that the assumption of self-similarity rather than the spherical symmetry is crucial in determining the nature of the singularity in any gravitationally collapsing configuration.
Vacuum spacetimes with a two-dimensional orthogonally transitive group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> of proper homothetic motions acting on nonnull orbits are investigated with the aid of the Geroch-Held-Penrose formalism. It is found that these spacetimes admit in general an<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>3</sub> of homothetic motions containing two commuting and hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector fields. The metric equations are integrated, and the line elements of the spacetimes in question are explicitly given in a diagonal form.
We use the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ghp</span> formalism to obtain perfect fluid space-times with a two-dimensional and orthogonally transitive group of proper homothetic motions<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub>, with the additional condition that the four-velocity of the fluid either lies on the group orbits or is orthogonal to them. In the first case the orbits of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> are timelike and all possible solutions are explicitly given. They comprise (i) space-times of Petrov type I that admit a group<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>3</sub> containing two hypersurface orthogonal and commuting Killing vectors (when the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> is abelian, the fluid has a stiff equation of state and the space-time is of type D), and (ii) a class of type D static space-times with a maximal<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> in which the two-spaces orthogonal to the group orbits have constant curvature. When the orbits of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> are spacelike, the fluid is necessarily stiff and different classes of solutions admitting maximal<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>2</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>3</sub> are identified.
When assigning relative nucleation probabilities<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>∼<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em><sup>−I</sup> for real tunneling configurations in Euclidean quantum cosmology, it is proposed to compare different<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>'s at equal values of the nucleation energy, instead of the cosmological constant. This approach is more likely to predict the space-time dimension to be four than the standard procedure. We summarize previous work and include some arguments that do not rely on the value of the gravitational constant in higher dimensions.
The previously suggested existence of second-order phase transitions in a series of Kerr-Newman holes is re-examined in the framework of equilibrium black-hole thermodynamics, to distinguish a true transition from another confusing phenomenon. By adopting a physical interpretation unique to the black-hole thermodynamics, various critical exponents are calculated for one side of the transition which is shown actually very likely to occur at the extremal limit.
In this paper an infinite dimensional Morse theory for lightlike geodesics joining a point with a timelike curve on a class of Lorentzian manifolds is developed under intrinsic assumptions. It yields applications to the gravitational lens effect. In particular we show that the number of images in the gravitational lens effect is infinite or odd.
The use of time-like geodesics to measure temporal distances is better justified than the use of space-like geodesics for a measurement of spatial distances. We give examples where a “spatial distance” cannot be appropriately determined by the length of a space-like geodesic.
By turning to a differential formulation, the post-Newtonian description of metric gravitational theories (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ppn</span> formalism) has been extended to include cosmological boundary conditions. The dimensionless expansion parameter is the ratio distance<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> (measured from the center of a selected space region) to Hubble distance<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c/H</em><sub>0</sub>. The aim was to explore the significance and applicability of a Newtonian cosmology and to clarify to some extent its relation to general-relativistic cosmology. It turns out that up to post-Newtonian order two classes of gravitational theories can be distinguished, here called Machian and non-Machian. In a non-Machian theory like General Relativity the dynamics of cosmic objects within a space region<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L« c/H</em><sub>0</sub>. is described by the usual<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ppn</span> metric set up for the objects, without introducing time-dependent Newtonian potentials at the origin of the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ppn</span> coordinate system. Such potentials of obviously cosmological origin seem to be required for the majority of (by our definition) Machian gravitational theories (including, e.g., Brans-Dicke). Conditions for a theory to be Machian or non-Machian are given in terms of algebraic relations for the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ppn</span> parameters.
In this paper we investigate solutions of Einstein's field equations for the spherically symmetric perfect fluid case with shear and with vanishing acceleration. If these solutions have shear, they must necessarily be nonstatic. We examine the integrable cases of the field equations systematically. Among the cases with shear we find three known classes of solutions. The fourth class of solutions with shear leads to a generalized Emden-Fowler equation. This equation is discussed by means of Lie's method of point symmetries.
A modified version of the field equations of general relativity is obtained on relaxing the covariant energy-momentum conservation condition. This introduces a single arbitrary constant and does not appear to upset the successes of general relativity in or outside cosmology. The matter-dominated cosmological model, based on the generalized field equations, is discussed. It is shown to provide more room for consistency with the observational data.
The derivation of MacCallum-Taub's averaged high-frequency Lagrangian [1] is analysed with special attention paid to the assumptions made along the derivation. It is shown that averaged high-frequency Lagrangians of the same form as MacCallum-Taub's Lagrangian can be derived by applying the Brill-Hartle and macroscopic gravity averaging schemes. A procedure for the derivation of a Lagrangian of macroscopic gravity (an averaged Hilbert action) is proposed and its high-frequency limit (namely, its high-frequency perturbation expansion up to the second order terms in perturbations, which is referred to as MacCallum-Taub's limit) is calculated. There is disagreement [2] in the expressions for MacCallum-Taub's averaged high-frequency Lagrangian and the high-frequency limit of the macroscopic gravity Lagrangian. Possible reasons for such disagreement are analysed. The origin of the difference is shown to consist in using the propagation equation for perturbations, i.e. the linearized Ricci tensor vanishes, during the derivation (averaging) carried out in [1]. A new derivation of an averaged high-frequency Lagrangian without assuming the propagation equation to hold and by taking into account the proper correlation functions is given. The newly derived expression is shown to coincide with MacCallum-Taub's limit of the macroscopic gravity Lagrangian, which resolves the disagreement.
We consider a non-diagonal cylindrically symmetric metric in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime. We obtain a number of homogeneous and inhomogeneous perfect fluid cosmological models, which include the 5-dimensional analogue of the recently found 4-dimensional non-singular stiff fluid model. Amongst the homogeneous models, which are all as expected big-bang singular, there is the 5-dimensional version of the Friedman-Robertson-Walker flat model.
Construction of the local geodesic multiplication is described. Following S. Okubo with some modifications, two families of local geodesic<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">brst</span>-like cohomologies are introduced. Some problems arising from these constructions and possible applications are discussed.
The anisotropic homogeneous ℙ<sup>3</sup> is isometrically globally embedded into a nine-dimensional Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean space. In a special case the Euclidean space is six-dimensional. The space-sections of the anti-Mach metric appear as a submanifold of the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em><sup>9</sup>. We obtain also the isometric embedding of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) with its natural Killing metric.
The conditions that allow us to consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor as a statistical average, at some particular temperature, are given. When the mean value of created particles is stationary, a planckian distribution for the field modes is obtained. In the massless approximation, the temperature dependence is like that corresponding to a radiation-dominated Friedmann-like model.


We study the first-order gauge-invariant perturbations of the metric (the scalar type), the energy density and the four-velocity of matter inside a collapsing homogeneous sphere of dust. Unless in a particular case, these perturbations grow towards the end of the collapse.
The role of the equivalence principle in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and matter wave interferometry, especially atom beam interferometry, will be discussed. A generalised form of the weak equivalence principle which is capable of covering quantum phenomena too, will be proposed. It is shown that this generalised equivalence principle is valid for matter wave interferometry and for the dynamics of expectation values. In addition, the use of this equivalence principle makes it possible to determine the structure of the interaction of quantum systems with gravitational and inertial fields. It is also shown that the path of the mean value of the position operator in the case of gravitational interaction does fulfill this generalised equivalence principle.
We generalize Robertson's frame designed to discuss the experimental tests of Special Relativity. We include parametrized post-Newtonian theories of gravitation in the new frame. This generalization includes covariant equations for the motion of a test particle. We discuss the possibility of new tests such as tests of Special Relativity in astronomy.
We examine the nonlinear evolution of two types of spacetime by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by the gradient expansion method to investigate the validity and limitation of the method itself. The first type is the nonlinear evolution of spacetime for an irrotational perfect fluid, and the second type is for an irrotational dust or an scalar field with an exponential potential in<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional space. We find a recursion relation for the generating functional. Taking the comoving coordinate, the three-metric for perfect fluid is found up to the third order. The expression for the three-metric is in agreement with that of Comer et al. but the numerical coefficient is slightly different because of the different choice of coordinate condition. For a scalar field with an exponential potential in higher dimension, inhomogeneities decay during inflationary phase. The (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>+1)-dimensional axisymmetric Szekeres solution is easily found as a byproduct.
A new approach to the algebraic classification of second order symmetric tensors in 5-dimensional space-times is presented. The possible Segre types for a symmetric two-tensor are found. A set of canonical forms for each Segre type is obtained. A theorem which collects together some basic results on the algebraic structure of the Ricci tensor in 5-dimensional space-times is also stated.
We present a detailed analysis of the motion of test particles around gauge and global monopoles using the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) formalism. We find that particles cannot be trapped by gauge monopoles while there may exist bound orbits for global monopoles under certain conditions.
In order to avoid a speed-of-light catastrophe in General Relativity with an electromagnetic source, gauge invariance with respect to the electric charge is broken with the photon acquiring mass. The general equations for the Einstein-Maxwell system are derived for the case with massive photons. Nonminimal couplings which might compete with the small minimal photon mass term are included.
A very simplified model of the Universe is considered in order to propose an alternative approach to the irreversible evolution of the Universe at very early times. The entropy generation at the quantum stage can be thought of as a consequence of an instability of the system. Then particle creation arises from this instability.
As is well-known, the Gauss theorem, according to which any 2-dimensional Riemannian metric can be mapped locally conformally into an euclidean space, does not hold in three dimensions. We define in this paper transformations of a new type, that we call principal. They map 3-dimensional spaces into spaces of constant curvature. We give a few explicit examples of principal transformations and we prove, at the linear approximation, that any metric deviating not too much from the euclidean metric can be mapped by a principal transformation into the euclidean metric.
Stationary observers with the extremal value of the total thrust, considered in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, have interesting privileges: they Fermi-transport their 4-acceleration, and those with zero vertical acceleration measure that the particles on local radially non-accelerated circular orbits co- and counter-rotate with the same modulus of velocity.



A thermodynamical approach is used to solve the back-reaction problem of the Kerr black hole; the dressed mass, the dressed angular momentum, and the dressed entropy are calculated.
The coupled system of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations is solved numerically for a Robertson-Walker symmetric universe. The open universe must be excluded because, for this situation, the coupled system is unable to produce energy-momentum density<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub>μν</sub> in agreement with the Robertson-Walker symmetry. For the closed universe, inflation solutions do occur if an early re-collapse is avoided by suitable choice of the initial conditions. The energy exchange between the minimally coupled Higgs and Yang-Mills subsystems is very small so that the inflating power of the Higgs field cannot be disturbed by the presence of the Yang-Mills field. After the inflation phase the influence of the Yang-Mills field is completely negligible (cosmic no-hair theorem).
We study the problem of test-particle motion in the Nonsymmetric Gravitational Theory (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ngt</span>) assuming the four-velocity of the particle is parallel-transported along the trajectory. The predicted motion is studied on a static, spherically symmetric background field, with particular attention paid to radial and circular motions. Interestingly, it is found that the proper time taken to travel between any two non-zero radial positions is finite. It is also found that circular orbits can be supported at lower radii than in General Relativity for certain forms of motion. We present three interactions which could be used as alternate methods for coupling a test-particle to the antisymmetric components of the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">ngt</span> field. One of these takes the form of a Yukawa force in the weak-field limit of a static, spherically symmetric field, which could lead to interesting phenomenology.
We reconsider the principle of general covariance and give a rigorous formulation of a principle of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">restricted</em> covariance. We give a number of examples of preferred coordinate systems, considered in the literature, and in each case demonstrate the applicability of the notion of restricted covariance proposed.
Multidimensional cosmological models with a space-time consisting of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n (n</em> ≥2) Einstein spaces are investigated for a special class of multicomponent perfect fluid as a matter source. The dynamical behaviour of the universe is described. In the case of static internal spaces the external space evolves like a Friedmann universe with changing effective equation of state. Some of the models considered are integrable and classical as well as quantum solutions are found. Some of them represent wormholes. Quantum wormholes have a discrete spectrum.
We study quantum gravitational effects on black hole radiation, using loop quantum gravity. Bekenstein and Mukhanov have recently considered the modifications caused by quantum gravity on Hawking's thermal black-hole radiation. Using a simple ansatz for the eigenstates of the area, they have obtained the intriguing result that the quantum properties of geometry affect the radiation considerably, yielding a discrete spectrum, definitely non-thermal. Here, we replace the simple ansatz employed by Bekenstein and Mukhanov with the actual eigenstates of the area computed using loop quantum gravity. We derive the emission spectra, using a classic result in number theory by Hardy and Ramanujan. Disappointingly, we do not recover the Bekenstein-Mukhanov discrete spectrum, but — effectively — a continuum spectrum, consistent with Hawking's result. The Bekenstein-Mukhanov argument for the discreteness of the specrum is therefore likely to be an artifact of the ansatz, rather than a robust result (at least in its present kinematical version). The result is an example of concrete (although somewhat disappointing) application of nonperturbative quantum gravity.
In a Wheeler-DeWitt approach to quantum string cosmology, the present state of the Universe arises from the scattering and reflection of the wave function representing the initial string vacuum in superspace. This scenario is described and compared with the more conventional quantum cosmology picture, in which the birth of the Universe is represented as a process of tunnelling “from nothing” in superspace.
We study some known static vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations, namely, the A and B metrics of Ehlers and Kundt. All of them have axial symmetry, so they can be transformed to the Weyl form. In Weyl coordinates log √−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>44</sub> obeys a Laplace equation, and from this a source, called<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the Newtonian image source</em>, can be identified. We use the image sources to give a possible interpretation to the metrics. The procedure is successful in some cases. In others it fails because the Weyl transform does not have reasonable properties at infinity.
Axiomatic physical derivations of the mathematical picture of spacetime used in General Relativity, which are based on the primitive concepts of free fall and light propagation, have led in a direct, convincing manner only to a Weyl spacetime; a further reduction to the usual Lorentzian manifold required postulates which are much less convincing. In this paper we present a new postulate within a more recent spacetime axiomatics, by which there the Lorentzian spacetime is reached in a different way. The theory is based on similar basic notions with more emphasis on clock parametrizations; no quantumtheoretical reasonings are used. A very natural construction of the spacetime metric is the basis for the postulate which is essentially a compatibility condition for parametrizations of worldlines. The result motivates a renewed search for a better way of reduction in the mentioned theories and can guide it.
Beginning from the Einstein-Liouville coupled system of equations for the description of a universe consisting of massive collisionless particles (dark matter), this paper presents a totally gauge-invariant framework for studying the time development of perturbations in homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models. Since the Einstein-Liouville system involves infinitely many degrees of freedom (a function of the momentum variable), emphasis is placed on finding conditions under which the dark mass behaves in an essentially hydrodynamic way. It is demonstrated that, for collisionless matter in the late universe, the complete characterization of cosmological perturbations can be obtained if one defines in a suitable way eighteen “geometrically” independent, not identically vanishing gauge-invariant variables. These basic variables are important because they enable one to divide the infinitesimal perturbations into physically natural equivalence classes: two infinitesimal perturbations<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δG</em><sub>0</sub> and<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δG</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>′</sup> </span> are said to be equivalent if there is a transformation of the Lie type which carries<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δG</em><sub>0</sub> into<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δG</em><span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup>′</sup> </span> and vice versa. Another welcome feature of this formulation is that any gauge-invariant quantity can be constructed directly from the basic variables through purely algebraic and differential operations. Comparisons with other work on the Einstein-Liouville system are also made.
In the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity the integral form of the Hamiltonian constraint contains explicitly the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">adm</span> energy in the case of asymptotically flat space-times. We show that such expression of the constraint leads to a natural and straightforward construction of a Schrödinger equation for time-dependent physical states. The quantized Hamiltonian constraint is thus written as an energy eigenvalue equation. We further analyse the constraint equations in the case of a space-time endowed with a spherically symmetric geometry. We find the general functional form of the time-dependent solutions of the quantized Hamiltonian and vector constraints.
We present a Euclidean wormhole solution in vacuum Brans-Dicke theory, which is different from that obtained by Accetta et al. This wormhole appears to have the feature that its throat dimension increases linearly with Euclidean cosmic time, although this increase may not be measurable. It also requires a negative Brans-Dicke parameter<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>.
There exists a two parameter action, the variation of which produces both the geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation. In this paper it is shown that this action can be quantized by the canonical method, resulting in equations which generalize the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting equations might have applications, and also show that entirely unexpected systems can be quantized. The possible applications of quantized geodesic deviation are to i) the spreading wave packet in quantum theory, and ii) the one-particle-to-many-particle problem in second quantized quantum field theory.
We show that the pseudotensors of Einstein, Tolman, Landau and Lifshitz, Papapetrou, and Weinberg essentially coincide for any Kerr-Schild metric if calculations are carried out in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates. This generalizes a previous result by Gürses and Gürsey that dealt only with the pseudotensors of Einstein and Landau-Lifshitz. We compute exactly the energy and angular momentum distributions for the Kerr-Newman metric in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates and compare the results with those obtained by using different definitions of quasilocal mass, which unlike pseudotensors do not agree for all Kerr-Schild metrics.
Kossowski and Kriele derived boundary conditions on the metric at a surface of signature change. We point out that their derivation is based not only on certain smoothness assumptions but also on a postulated form of the Einstein field equations. Since there is no canonical form of the field equations at a change of signature, their conclusions are not inescapable. We show here that a weaker formulation is possible, in which less restrictive smoothness assumptions are made, and (a slightly different form of) the Einstein field equations are satisfied. In particular, in this formulation it is possible to have a bounded energy-momentum tensor at a change of signature without satisfying their condition that the extrinsic curvature vanish.



Gamma ray Bursts (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">grb</span>s) — short bursts of few hundred keV γ-rays — have fascinated astronomers since their accidental discovery in the Sixties.<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Grb</span>s were ignored by most relativists who did not expect them to be associated with any relativistic phenomenon. The recent observations of the<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">batse</span> detector on the Compton-GRO satellite have revolutionized our ideas on these bursts and the picture that emerges shows that<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">grb</span>s are the most relativistic objects discovered so far.
In the non-relativistic and quasi-static limit, it is possible to map exactly the system of galaxies in the observable universe onto an Ising magnet. Techniques from the theory of critical phenomena as applied to magnets can then be employed to calculate rigorously the galaxy-to-galaxy correlation function, whose critical exponent is predicted to be between 1.530 to 1.862, to be compared to the empirical/observational value of 1.6 to 1.8.
Two simple model problems relevant for the gravitational-wave modes of relativistic stars are discussed. It is shown that the entire mode-spectrum can be obtained if one considers the modes as arising because of the trapping of gravitational waves by the spacetime curvature. The stellar fluid need play no dynamic role. Furthermore, it is shown that two distinct families of gravitational-wave modes exist. The first corresponds to waves trapped inside the star, while the second is similar to acoustic waves scattered off a hard sphere. An infinite number of the first kind of modes exist, but the latter family will only have a few members.
In the present article four non-static perfect fluid solutions have been derived by considering a plane symmetric metric of embedding class one. Out of the solutions so obtained two solutions possess an acceleration free velocity vector field while the other two have flow with acceleration. As far as the authors are aware the solutions with non-vanishing acceleration are new.
Instead of the metric conformal to flat spacetime, we take the metric conformal to a spacetime which can be thought of as “minimally” curved in the sense that free particles experience no gravitational force yet it has non-zero curvature. The base spacetime can be written in the Kerr-Schild form in spherical polar coordinates. The conformal metric then admits the unique three-parameter family of perfect fluid solutions which are static and inhomogeneous. The density and pressure fall off in the curvature radial coordinates as<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>−2</sup>, for unbounded cosmological model with a barotropic equation of state. This is the characteristic of an isothermal fluid. We thus have an ansatz for an isothermal perfect fluid model. The solution can also represent bounded fluid spheres.



A so-called extended elliptical-complex (EEC) function method is proposed and used to further study the Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> vector fields (EMDA-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> theory, for brevity) for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\( p = 1,2,\ldots \)</span>. An Ernst-like <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(2^{k+1}\times 2^{k+1}(k = [(p+1)/2])\)</span> matrix EEC potential is introduced and the motion equations of the stationary axisymmetric EMDA-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> theory are written as a so-called Hauser–Ernst-like self-dual relation for the EEC matrix potential. In particular, for the EMDA-2 theory, two Hauser–Ernst-type EEC linear systems are established and based on their solutions some new parametrized symmetry transformations are explicitly constructed. These hidden symmetries are verified to constitute an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, which is the semidirect product of the Kac–Moody algebra <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(su(2,2)\otimes R(t,t^{-1})\)</span> and Virasoro algebra (without centre charges). These results show that the studied EMDA-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> theories possess very rich symmetry structures and the EEC function method is necessary and effective.
In this paper an application of Newman-Janis algorithm in spherically symmetric metrics with the functions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M(u,r)</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e(u,r)</em> has been discussed. After the transformation of the metric via this algorithm, these two functions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M(u,r)</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e(u,r)</em> will be transformed to depend on the three variables <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u,r,θ</em>. With these functions of three variables, all the Newman–Penrose (NP) spin coefficients, the Ricci as well as the Weyl scalars have been calculated from the Cartan’s structure equations. Using these NP quantities, we first give examples of rotating solutions of Einstein’s field equations like Kerr–Newman, rotating Vaidya solution and rotating Vaidya–Bonnor solution. It is found that the technique developed by Wang and Wu can be used to give further examples of embedded rotating solutions, that the rotating Kerr–Newman solution can be combined smoothly with the rotating Vaidya solution to derive the Kerr–Newman–Vaidya solution, and similarly, Kerr–Newman–Vaidya–Bonnor solution of the field equations. It has also shown that the embedded universes like Kerr–Newman de Sitter, rotating Vaidya–Bonnor–de Sitter, Kerr–Newman–Vaidya–de Sitter can be derived from the general solutions with Wang–Wu function. All rotating embedded solutions derived here can be written in Kerr–Schild forms, showing the extension of Xanthopoulos’s theorem. It is also found that all the rotating solutions admit non-perfect fluids.
We study the acceleration of the universe as a consequence of the time evolution of the vacuum energy in cosmological models based in braneworld theories in 5D. A variable vacuum energy may appear if the size of the extra dimension changes during the evolution of the universe. In this scenario the acceleration of the universe is related not only to the variation of the cosmological term, but also to the time evolution of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and, possibly, to the variation of other fundamental “constants” as well. This is because the expansion rate of the extra dimensionappears in different contexts, notably in expressions concerning the variation of rest mass and electric charge. We concentrate our attention on spatially-flat, homogeneous and isotropic, brane-universes where the matter density decreases as an inverse power of the scale factor, similar (but at different rate) to the power law in FRW-universes of general relativity. We show that these braneworld cosmologies are consistent with the observed accelerating universe and other observational requirements. In particular, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> becomes constant and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\rm \Lambda}_{(4)} \approx const \times H^2\)</span> asymptotically in time. Another important feature is that the models contain no “adjustable” parameters. All the quantities, even the five-dimensional ones, can be evaluated by means of measurements in 4D. We provide precise constrains on the cosmological parameters and demonstrate that the “effective” equation of state of the universe can, in principle, be determined by measurements of the deceleration parameter alone. We give an explicit expression relating the density parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\rm \Omega}_{\rho}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\rm \Omega}_{\rm \Lambda}\)</span> and the deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>. These results constitute concrete predictions that may help in observations for an experimental/observational test of the model.

The notion of standard positive probability distribution function (tomogram) which describes the quantum state of the universe alternatively to the wave function or to the density matrix is introduced. Connection of the tomographic probability distribution with the Wigner function of the universe and with the star-product (deformation) quantization procedure is established.</p><p class="Para">Using the Radon transform, the Wheeler-De Witt generic equation for the probability function is written in tomographic form. Some examples of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace are elaborated explicitly for homogeneous isotropic cosmological models. Some interpretational aspects of the probability description of the quantum state are discussed.
A discussion on quantum mechanics, general relativity and their relations is introduced. The assumption of the absolute validity of conservation laws and the extension to a 5D-space lead to reconsider several shortcomings and paradoxes of modern physics under a new light without the necessity to take into account symmetry breakings. In this picture, starting from first principles, and after a reduction procedure from 5D to 4D, dynamics leads to the natural emergence of two time arrows and ofa scalar-tensor theory of gravity. In this framework, phenomena like entanglement of systems and topology changes can be naturally accounted and, furthermore, several experimental evidences as gamma ray bursts, sizes of astrophysical structures and the observed values of cosmological parameters can be explained. The identification, thanks to conservation laws, of a covariant symplectic structure as a general feature also for gravity can be seen as a deep link common to all the interactions.
Some properties of the Hawking radiation emitted by the family of black holes of the Einstein–Maxwell–Dilaton with cosmologicalconstant theory in three dimensions found by Chan and Mann are studiedusing the complex paths method and the Damour–Ruffini method. Theexact values of the quasinormal frequencies of the massless Diracfield propagating on a particular black hole of this family arecalculated. Taking as a basis the results obtained for the values ofthe quasinormal frequencies the instability of some modes isdiscussed. The extension of these results to the black holes of theEinstein–Maxwell–Dilaton theory in four dimensions is studied in theappendix.
In this paper we work in perturbative quantum gravity and we introduce a new effective model for gravity. Expanding the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian in graviton field powers we have an infinite number of terms. In this paper we study the possibility of an interpretation of more than three graviton interacting vertices as effective vertices of a most fundamental theory that contain tensor fields. Here we introduce a Lagrangian model named I.T.B. (intermediate-tensor-boson) where four gravitational “pseudo-currents” that contain two gravitons couple to three massive tensorial fields of ranks one, three and five, respectively. We show that the exchange of those massive particles reproduces, at low energy, the interacting vertices for four or more gravitons. In a particular version, the model contains a dimensionless coupling constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> and the mass “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sub>Φ</sub>” of the intermediate bosons as free parameters. The universal gravitational constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sub> is shown to be proportional to the inverse of mass squared of mediator fields, particularly <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(G_{N}\sim g^{2}/M_{\rm \Phi}^{2}\)</span>. A foresighting choice of the dimensionless coupling constant could lower the energy scale where quantum gravity aspects show up.
In this paper we work in perturbative quantum gravity coupled to scalar matter at tree level and we introduce a new effective model in analogy with the Fermi theory of weak interaction and in relation with a previous work where we have studied only the gravity and its self-interaction. This is an extension of the I.T.B. model (Intermediate-Tensor-Boson) for gravity also to gravitationally interacting scalar matter. We show that in a particular gauge the infinite series of interactions containing “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>” gravitons and two scalars could be rewritten in terms of only two Lagrangians containing a massive field, the graviton and, obviously, the scalar field. Using the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>-matrix we obtain that the low energy limit of the amplitude reproduces the local Lagrangian for the scalar coupled to gravity.
The Einstein field equations are solved in (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n+2</em>) dimensional Szekeres’ space–time model with matter content as shear free isotropic fluid undergoing radial heat flow. It is noted that heat flow is possible only in the radial direction. Then a model is proposed for a collapsing quasi-spherical radiating star. For the description of the radiation of the system, plane symmetric Vaidya solution is considered. Both physical conditions and thermodynamical relations are studied using local conservation of momentum and surface red-shift. It is found that for the existence of radiation on the boundary, pressure (on the boundary) is not necessary.
We study the gravitational collapse in (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n+2</em>)-D quasi-spherical Szekeres space–times (which possess no Killing vectors) with dust as the matter distribution. Instead of choosing the radial coordinate ‘r’ as the initial value for the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, we consider a power function of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> as the initial scale for the radius <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. We examine the influence of initial data on the formation of singularity in gravitational collapse.
We have derived all the charged fluid spheres described by a space-time with its hypersurfaces <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = const. as spheroids subject to a particular form of electric field intensity. Only one out of the four solutions so obtained is reducible to its uncharged counterpart in the absence of the charge.
We show that the BMPV metric has Petrov type 22. This means that the Breckenridge–Myers–Peet–Vafa (BMPV) metric is less algebraically special than the five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric, which has Petrov type <span class="EmphasisTypeUnderline ">22.
We find that the expansion of the universe is accelerating by analyzing the recent observation data of type I<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> supernova (SN-Ia). It indicates that the equation of state of the dark energy might be smaller than -1, which leads to the introduction of phantom models featured by its negative kinetic energy to account for the regime of equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &lt; -1. In this paper the possibility of using a non-minimally coupled real scalar field as phantom to realize the equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &lt; -1 is discussed. The main equations which govern the evolution of the universe are obtained. Then we rewrite them with the observable quantities.

We construct perfect fluid metrics with two symmetries by means of a recently developed geometrical method [1]. The Einstein equations are reduced to a single equation for a conformal factor. Under additional assumptions we obtain new cosmological solutions of Bianchi type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">II</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">VI</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">0</em> </sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">VII</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">0</em> </sub>. The solutions depend on an arbitrary function of time, which can be specified in order to satisfy an equation of state.
Dynamic and static wormhole solutions of Einstein’s equations with the cosmological constant are presented. The dynamic solutions can be interpreted as Friedmann–Robertson–Walker models with traversable wormholes. The null energy condition is checked for both dynamic and static wormholes and it is shown explicitly that the cosmological constant modifies the violation of this condition.
We compute the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em><span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\bar q}\)</span> potential in the Schwinger model on the Schwarzschild black hole. This potential is also discussed using The WKB approximation by considering the rôle of zero modes of massive scalar fields. We study the entropy bound for a charged object using the generalized second law; and at the end, a scenario for charge confinement is proposed on AdS black holes.
A nonlocal method of extracting the positive (or the negative) frequency part of a field, based on knowledge of a 2-point function, leads to certain natural generalizations of the normal ordering of quantum fields in classical gravitational and electromagnetic backgrounds and illuminates the origin of the recently discovered nonlocalities related to a local description of particles. A local description of particle creation by gravitational backgrounds is given, with emphasis on the case of black-hole evaporation. The formalism reveals a previously hidden relation between various definitions of the particle current and those of the energy–momentum tensor. The implications to particle creation by classical backgrounds, as well as to the relation between vacuum energy, dark matter, and cosmological constant, are discussed.
Ergo surfaces are investigated in spacetimes with a cosmological constant. We find the existence of multiple timelike Killing vectors, each corresponding to a distinct ergo surface, with no one being preferred. Using a kinematic invariant, which provides a measure of hypersurface orthogonality, we explore its potential role in selecting a preferred timelike Killing vector and consequently a unique ergo surface.
Asymptotic properties of electromagnetic waves are studied within the context of Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology. Electromagnetic fields are considered as small perturbations on the background spacetime and Maxwell’s equations are solved for all three cases of flat, closed and open FRW universes. The asymptotic character of these solutions is investigated and their relevance to the problem of cosmological tails of electromagnetic waves is discussed.
Beginning with the stress-energy tensor of an elastic string this paper derives a relativistic string and its form in a parallel transported Fermi frame including its reduction to a Cosserat string in the Newtonian limit. In a Fermi frame gravitational curvature is seen to induce three dominant relative acceleration terms dependent on: position, velocity and position, strain and position, respectively. An example of a string arranged in an axially flowing ring (a lasso) is shown to have a set of natural frequencies that can be parametrically excited by a monochromatic plane gravitational wave. The lasso also exhibits, in common with spinning particles, oscillations about geodesic motion in proportion to spin magnitude and wave amplitude when the spin axis lies in the gravitational wave front.
We examine the conditions imposed on spacetime geometry by linear and extended thermodynamics. In this analysis we confine ourselves on shear-free spacetimes with divergence-free Weyl tensor. This results in a variety of well-known spacetimes which have to have simple kinematic properties as well as very restricted source structure. In all cases the thermodynamical considerations show the privileged role of the equation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = −ρ which can be interpreted as cosmological constant. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the restrictions imposed on the spacetime geometry in the case of extended thermodynamics (for vanishing anisotropic pressure) are much stronger than in the linear case.
A cosmological time variable is emerged from the hamiltonian formulation of unimodular theory of gravity to measure the evolution of dynamical observables in the theory. A set of ‘constants of motion’ has been identified for the theory on the null hypersurfaces that its evolution is with respect to the volume clock introduced by the cosmological time variable.
The possibility of analyzing the node Ω of the GP-B satellite in order to measure also the Lense–Thirring effect on its orbit is examined. This feature is induced by the general relativistic gravitomagnetic component of the Earth gravitational field. The GP-B mission has been launched in April 2004 and is aimed mainly to the measurement of the gravitomagnetic precession of four gyroscopes carried onboard at a claimed accuracy of 1%. of better. The aliasing effect of the solid Earth and ocean components of the solar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em><sub>1</sub> tidal perturbations would make the measurement of the Lense–Thirring effect on the orbit unfeasible. Indeed, the science period of the GP-B mission amounts to almost one year. During this time span the Lense–Thirring shift on the GP-B node would be 164 milliarcseconds (mas), while the tidal perturbations on its node would have a period of the order of 10<sup>3</sup> years and amplitudes of the order of 10<sup>5</sup> mas.
The trace anomaly for free propagation in the context of a conformally invariant scalar field theory defined on a curved manifold of positive constant curvature with boundary is evaluated through use of an asymptotic heat kernel expansion. In addition to their direct physical significance the results are also of relevance to the holographic principle and to Quantum Cosmology.
We explore the conditions for the existence of Noether symmetries for higher order gravity theory, after introducing an auxiliary variable, which gives the correct quantum description of the theory. It turns out that the application of Noether theorem in higher order theory of gravity is a powerful tool to find the solution of the field equations. A few such physically reasonable solutions like power law inflation are presented.
In this comment we indicate that in the Palatini formulation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em><sup>2</sup> gravity, there will be no gravity-driven inflation and under some particular assumptions there will be a mild power-law inflation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> ∼ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em><sup>2</sup>.
A conjecture stated by Raychaudhuri which claims that the only physical perfect fluid non-rotating non-singular cosmological models are comprised in the Ruiz–Senovilla and Fernández–Jambrina families is shown to be incorrect. An explicit counterexample is provided and the failure of the argument leading to the result is explicitly pointed out.
We reply to the comment by L. Fernandez–Jambrina.
We argue that the starting point of Kaluza’s idea of unifying electrodynamics and gravity was the analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism which was pointed out by Einstein and Thirring. It seems that Kaluza’s attention was turned to this point by the three papers on the Lense–Thirring effect and the analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism which were published a short time before Kaluza’s paper was submitted. We provide here also an English translation of the third of these papers (Phys. Zeits. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">19</strong>: 204, 1918).

Examples of equations of motion in classical relativistic mechanics are studied: the equations of motion of a charged spinning particle moving in a space-time (with or without torsion) in the presence of an electromagnetic field are derived <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">via</em> Souriau presymplectic reduction. Then, the extension of Souriau’s ideas to Lagrangian field theory due to Witten, Crnković, Zuckerman is reviewed using the variational bicomplex, the basic properties of the Lund–Regge equations describing the motion of a string interacting with a scalar field and moving in Minkowski spacetime are recalled, and a symplectic structure for their space of solutions is found.
We have studied the scalar perturbation of charged dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions. The black hole considered here is a solution to the low-energy string theory in 2+1 dimensions. The exact decay rates and the grey body factors for the massless minimally coupled scalar is computed for both the charged and the uncharged dilaton black holes. The charged and the uncharged black hole show similar behavior for grey body factors, reflection coefficients and decay rates.
The polarizable vacuum (PV) representation of general relativity (GR), derived from a model by Dicke and related to the “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TH</em>ε μ ” formalism used in comparative studies of gravitational theories, provides for a compact derivation of the Levi–Civita effect (both magnetic and electric), herein demonstrated.
We first derive the relation between the eikonal approximation to the Maxwell wave equations in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium and geodesic motion in a three dimensional Riemannian manifold using a method which identifies the symplectic structure of the corresponding mechanics. We then apply an analogous method to the five dimensional generalization of Maxwell theory required by the gauge invariance of Stueckelberg’s covariant classical and quantum dynamics to demonstrate, in the eikonal approximation, the existence of geodesic motion for the flow of mass in a four dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. No motion of the medium is required. These results provide a foundation for the geometrical optics of the five dimensional radiation theory and establish a model in which there is mass flow along geodesics. Finally, we discuss the interesting case of relativistic quantum theory in an anisotropic medium as well. In this case the eikonal approximation to the relativistic quantum mechanical current coincides with the geodesic flow governed by the pseudo-Riemannian metric obtained from the eikonal approximation to solutions of the Stueckelberg-Schrödinger equation. This construction provides a model for an underlying quantum mechanical structure for classical dynamical motion along geodesics on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The locally symplectic structure which emerges is that of Stueckelberg’s covariant mechanics on this manifold.
In this paper, assuming a linear change of the gravitational potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> in the universe, i.e. <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\rm \Delta} V=-c^{2H}{\rm \Delta} t\)</span>, some consequences are obtained. 1. The Hubble red shift is explained by the potential difference between the considered galaxy long time ago and the observer at this epoch. 2. The anomalous acceleration <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> </sub> from the spacecraft Pioneer 10 and 11 [1] is explained. 3. The deformations of the trajectories of planets are studied. It is shown that the planetary orbits are not axially symmetric and the angle from the perihelion to the aphelion is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\pi-\frac{H{\rm \Theta}}{3e\pi}\)</span>, while the angle from the aphelion to the perihelion is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\pi+\frac{H{\rm \Theta}}{3e\pi}\)</span>, where Θ is the orbital period. There is no perihelion precession caused by the time dependent gravitational potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>. The quotient of two consecutive orbital periods Θ<sub>1</sub> and Θ<sub>2</sub> is equal to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\rm \Theta}_2{:}\,{\rm \Theta}_1=1+\frac{{\rm \Theta} H}{3}.\)</span> This formula is tested for the pulsars B1885+09 and B1534+12, and the results are good.
We study the consequences due to time varying <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and Λ in scalar-tensor theories of gravity for cosmology, inspired by the modifications introduced by the Renormalization Group (RG) equations in the Quantum Einstein Gravity. We assume a power-law scale factor in presence contemporarily of both the scalar field and the matter components of the cosmic fluid, and analyze a special case and its generalization, also showing the possibility of a phantom cosmology. In both such situations we find a negative kinetic term for the scalar field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> and, possibly, an equation-of-state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em><sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> </sub> &lt; −1. A violation of dominant energy condition (DEC) for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> is also possible in both of them; but, while in the first special case the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>-energy density then remains positive, in the second one we find it negative.
We further develop a noncommutative model unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity proposed in Gen. Rel. Grav. (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">36</em>, 111–126 (2004)). Generalized symmetries of the model are defined by a groupoid Γ given by the action of a finite group on a space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>. The geometry of the model is constructed in terms of suitable (noncommutative) algebras on Γ. We investigate observables of the model, especially its position and momentum observables. This is not a trivial thing since the model is based on a noncommutative geometry and has strong nonlocal properties. We show that, in the position representation of the model, the position observable is a coderivation of a corresponding coalgebra, “coparallelly” to the well-known fact that the momentum observable is a derivation of the algebra. We also study the momentum representation of the model. It turns out that, in the case of the algebra of smooth, quickly decreasing functions on Γ, the model in its “quantum sector” is nonlocal, i.e., there are no nontrivial coderivations of the corresponding coalgebra, whereas in its “gravity sector” such coderivations do exist. They are investigated.
The Stephani universes that can be interpreted as an ideal gas evolving in local thermal equilibrium are determined. Five classes of thermodynamic schemes are admissible, which give rise to five classes of regular models and three classes of singular models. No Stephani universes exist representing an exact solution to a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classical</em> ideal gas (one for which the internal energy is proportional to the temperature). But some Stephani universes may approximate a classical ideal gas at first order in the temperature: all of them are obtained. Finally, some features about the physical behavior of the models are pointed out.
A charged analogue of Schwarzschild’s interior solution has been derived by considering the non-gravitational energy density to be constant along with a special choice of electric intensity. The charged fluid sphere so obtained is seen to be more general than that of P.S. Florides and joins smoothly with the Reissner-Nordström metric at the pressure-free interface. Also the new charged fluid sphere is capable of representing a superdense star with surface density of 2×10<sup>14</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup> which can occupy maximum mass 1.502408 times the solar mass. In the process of deriving the solution, the authors have also come across A. L. Mehra’s gaseous charged fluid model which is found to be unphysical as it has negative pressure at least at the center of the model.
Born–Infeld electrodynamics has attracted considerable interest due to its relation to strings and D-branes. In this paper the gravitational perturbations of electrically charged black holes in Einstein–Born–Infeld gravity are studied. The effective potentials for axial perturbations are derived and discussed. The quasi normal modes for the gravitational perturbations are computed using a WKB method. The modes are compared with those of the Reissner–Nordström black hole. The relation of the quasi normal modes with the non-linear parameter and the spherical index are also investigated.
It is shown that there are no purely magnetic, vacuum, spacetime metrics where any one of the following conditions holds: (a) the ratio of any two eigenvalues of the Weyl tensor is constant, (b) both of the Riemann principal null directions, defining the time-like blade, are nonrotating, (c) the shear tensor possesses an eigenvector <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup> which is defined by one of the space-like Riemann principal directions, (d) the vorticity is parallel to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup>, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> </sup> is defined by one of the space-like Riemann principal directions.
We discuss the relation between angular momenta and masses of galaxy structures base on the Li model of the universe with global rotation. In our previous paper [15] it was shown that the model predicts the presence of a minimum in this relation. In the present paper we discuss observational evidence allowing us to verify this relation. We find null angular momentum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> = 0 for the masses corresponding to the groups mass of the galaxy, and non-vanishing angular momenta for other galactic structures. We check these theoretical predictions analysing Tully’s galaxy groups. The existing data comparing alignment in different galactic structures are consistent with the obtained theoretical relation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>) if we interpret the growing alignment as the galactic increasing angular momenta in the galactic structure.
We rewrite the tensorial method of Peres [1] for the Petrov classification in terms of the Newman-Penrose formalism [2]. It results an algorithm computationally simpler that the one proposed by D’Inverno-Russell Clark [3].


We present a regular class of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exact</em> black hole solutions of the Einstein equations coupled with a nonlinear electrodynamics source. For weak fields the nonlinear electrodynamics becomes the Maxwell theory, and asymptotically the solutions behave as the Reissner–Nordström one. The class is endowed with four parameters, which can be thought of as the mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>, and a sort of dipole and quadrupole moments α and β, respectively. For α≥3, β≥4, and |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>|≤2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em><sub>c</sub><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> the corresponding solutions are regular charged black holes. For α = 3, they also satisfy the weak energy condition. For α = β = 0 we recover the Reissner–Nordström singular solution and for α = 3, β = 4 the family includes a previous regular black hole reported by the authors.
It is known that for nonlinear electrodynamics the First Law of Black Hole Mechanics holds, however the Smarr’s formula for the total mass does not. In this contribution we discuss the point and determine the corresponding expressions for the Bardeen black hole solution that represents a nonlinear magnetic monopole. The same is done for the regular black hole solution derived by Ayón–Beato and García [1], showing that in the case that variations of the electric charge are involved, the Smarr’s formula is no longer valid.
The possible description of the vacuum of quantum gravity through the so called κ-Poincaré group is analyzed considering some of the consequences of this symmetry in the path integral formulation of non-relativistic quantum theory. This study is carried out with two cases, firstly, a free particle, and finally, the situation of a particle immersed in a homogeneous gravitational field. It will be shown that the κ-Poincaré group implies the loss of some of the basic properties associated to Feynman’s path integral. For instance, loss of the group characteristic related to the time dependence of the evolution operator, or the breakdown of the composition law for amplitudes of events occurring successively in time. Additionally some similarities between the present idea and the so called restricted path integral formalism will be underlined. These analogies advocate the claim that if the κ-Poincaré group contains some of the physical information of the quantum gravity vacuum, then this vacuum could entail decoherence. This last result will also allow us to consider the possibility of analyzing the continuous measurement problem of quantum theory from a group-theoretical point of view, but now taking into account the κ-Poincaré symmetries.
In this paper we show the relationship between cylindrical D2-branes and cylindrical superconducting membranes described by a generic effective action at the bosonic level. In the first case the extended objects considered, arose as blown up type IIA superstrings to D2-branes, named supertubes. In the second one, the cosmological objects arose from some sort of field theories. The Dirac–Born–Infeld action describing supertubes is shown to be equivalent to the generic effective action describing superconducting membranes via a special transformation.</p><p class="Para"> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(Dedicated to Prof.
In this work we study static perfect fluid stars in 2+1 dimensions with an exterior BTZ spacetime. We found the general expression for the metric coefficients as a function of the density and pressure of the fluid. We found the conditions to have regularity at the origin throughout the analysis of a set of linearly independent invariants. We also obtain an exact solution of the Einstein equations, with the corresponding equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>(ρ), which is regular at the origin.
We study a model in which a closed universe with dust and quintessence matter components may look like an accelerated flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe at low redshifts. Several quantities relevant to the model are expressed in terms of observed density parameters, Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> and Ω<sub>Λ</sub>, and of the associated density parameter Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> </sub> related to the quintessence scalar field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>.
It is shown that Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmological models coupled to a single scalar field and to a perfect fluid fitting a wide class of matter perfect fluid state equations, determined in (3+1) dimensional gravity can be related to their (2+1) cosmological counterparts, and vice-versa, by using simple algebraic rules relating gravitational constants, state parameters, perfect fluid and scalar field characteristics. It should be pointed out that the demonstration of these relations for the scalar fields and potentials does not require the fulfilment of any state equation for the scalar field energy density and pressure. As far as to the perfect fluid is concerned, one has to demand the fulfilment of state equations of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>+ρ = γ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(ρ). If the considered cosmologies contain the inflation field alone, then any (3+1) scalar field cosmology possesses a (2+1) counterpart, and vice-versa. Various families of solutions are derived, and we exhibited their correspondence; for instance, solutions for pure matter perfect fluids and single scalar field fulfilling linear state equations, solutions for scalar fields coupled to matter perfect fluids, a general class of solutions for scalar fields subjected to a state equation of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em><sub>φ</sub>+ρ<sub>φ</sub> = γρ<sub>φ</sub><sup>β</sup> are reported, in particular Barrow–Saich, and Barrow–Burd–Lancaster–Madsen solutions are exhibited explicitly, and finally perfect fluid solutions for polytropic state equations are given.
We formulate a noncommutative description of topological half-flat gravity in four dimensions. BRST symmetry of this topological gravity is deformed through a twisting of the usual BRST quantization of noncommutative gauge theories. Finally it is argued that the resulting moduli space of instantons is characterized by the solutions of a noncommutative version of Plebański’s heavenly equation.
Cohomological Yang–Mills theory is formulated on a noncommutative differentiable four manifold through the θ-deformation of its corresponding BRST algebra. The resulting noncommutative field theory is a natural setting to define the θ-deformation of Donaldson invariants and they are interpreted as a mapping between the Chevalley–Eilenberg homology of noncommutative spacetime and the Chevalley–Eilenberg cohomology of noncommutative moduli of instantons. In the process we find that in the weak coupling limit the quantum theory is localized at the moduli space of noncommutative instantons.
We sketch the foundations of classical electrodynamics, in particular the transition that took place when Einstein, in 1915, succeeded to formulate general relativity. In 1916 Einstein demonstrated that, with a choice of suitable variables for the electromagnetic field, it is possible to put Maxwell’s equation into a form that is covariant under general coordinate transformations. This unfolded, by basic contributions of Kottler, Cartan, van Dantzig, Schouten &amp; Dorgelo, Toupin &amp; Truesdell, and Post, to what one may call <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">premetric classical electrodynamics.</em> This framework will be described shortly. An analysis is given of the physical dimensions involved in electrodynamics and subsequently the question of units addressed. It will be pointed out that these results are untouched by the generalization of classical to quantum electrodynamics (QED). We compare critically our results with those of <em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">L.B. Okun</strong></em> which he had presented at a recent conference.
A family of generalized composite intersecting <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>-brane solutions with orthogonal intersection rules is described.
In the framework of the (2+1)-dimensional topologically massive theory of gravity put forward by Deser, Jackiw, and Templeton, we analyze the (2+1) Kerr–Schild metric, in order to search for exact solutions, and to obtain plane-fronted wave solutions, which in the standard (2+1) Einstein theory (whose dynamics is provided by a cosmological constant term) do not exist.
We show how an adequate post-Newtonian generalization can be obtained for Newtonian dark matter halos associated with an empiric density profile. Applying this approach to halos that follow from the well known numerical simulations of Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW), we derive all dynamical variables and show that NFW halos approximately follow an ideal gas type of equation of state which fits very well to a polytropic relation in the region outside the core. This fact suggests that “outer” regions of NFW halos might be related to equilibrium states in the non-extensive Statistical Mechanics formalism proposed by Tsallis.
Eigenvectors of stress–energy tensor (the source in Einstein’s equations) form privileged bases in description of the corresponding spacetimes. When one or more of these vector fields are rotating (the property well determined in differential geometry), one says that the spacetime executes this rotation. Though the rotation in its proper sense is understood as that of a timelike congruence (vector field), the rotation of a spacelike congruence is not a less objective property if it corresponds to a canonical proper basis built of the just mentioned eigenvectors. In this last case, we propose to speak on pseudo-rotation. The both properties of metric, its material sources, and spacetime symmetries are considered in this paper.
In this work we present the Kerr space-time in a coordinate system compatible with the general expression for the stationary axial symmetric space times described in the Papapetrou form of the line element. We show that in these coordinates the metric coefficients are regular at least up to the external horizon, thus making it an adequate description for the analysis of phenomena near or at the horizon. Furthermore, we construct a null tetrad and present the equations for the perturbed Ψ<sub>4</sub> Weyl component, which again shows no divergences in the present description.
We study a closed model of the universe filled with viscous fluid and quintessence matter components in a Brans-Dicke type cosmological model. The dynamical equations imply that the universe may look like an accelerated flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe at low redshift. We consider here dissipative processes which follow a causal thermodynamics. The theory is applied to viscous fluid inflation, where accepted values for the total entropy in the observable universe are obtained.
We examine radiative corrections arising from Lorentz violating dimension five operators presumably associated with Planck scale physics as recently considered by Myers and Pospelov. We find that observational data result in bounds on the dimensionless parameters of the order 10<sup>−15</sup>. These represent the most stringent bounds on Lorentz violation to date.
We consider noncommutative quantum cosmology in the case of the low-energy string effective theory. Exact solutions are found and compared with the commutative case.
We present a formulation for potential–density pairs to describe axi-symmetric galaxies in the Newtonian limit of scalar–tensor theories of gravity. The scalar field is described by a modified Helmholtz equation with a source that is coupled to the standard Poisson equation of Newtonian gravity. The net gravitational force is given by two contributions: the standard Newtonian potential plus a term stemming from massive scalar fields. General solutions have been found for axisymmetric systems and the multipole expansion of the Yukawa potential is given. In particular, we have computed potential–density pairs of galactic disks for an exponential profile and their rotation curves.
In this work, the solution of the Einstein equations for a slowly rotating black hole with Born-Infeld charge is obtained. Geometrical properties and horizons of this solution are analyzed. The conditions when the ADM mass (as in the nonlinear static cases) and the ADM angular momentum of the system have been modified by the non linear electromagnetic field of the black hole, are considered.
In the context of quantum field theories in curved spacetime, we compute the effective action of the transition amplitude from vacuum to vacuum in the presence of an external gravitational field. The imaginary part of the resulted effective action determines the probability of vacuum decay via a quantum tunneling process, giving the rate and spectrum of particle creations. We show that (i) the gravitational field polarizes the vacuum and discretizes its spectrum; (ii) vacuum gains gravitational energy by such a polarization. On the basis of gravitational vacuum polarization, we discuss the quantum origin of vacuum decay in curved spacetime as pair-creations of particles and anti-particles. The thermal spectrum of particle creations is attributed to (i) the CPT invariance of pair-creations (annihilations) from (into) vacuum and (ii) vacuum acts as a reserve with the temperature determined by gravitational energy-gain.
We present a physically reasonable source for an static, axially-symmetric solution to the Einstein equations. Arguments are provided, supporting our belief that the exterior space-time produced by such source, describing a quadrupole correction to the Schwarzschild metric, is particularly suitable (among known solutions of the Weyl family) for discussing the properties of quasi-spherical gravitational fields.
We study equations of Riemann–Lanczos type on three dimensional manifolds. Obstructions to global existence for global Lanczos potentials are pointed out. We check that the imposition of the original Lanczos symmetries on the potential leads to equations which do not have a determined type, leading to problems when trying to prove global existence. We show that elliptic equations can be obtained by relaxing those symmetry requirements in at least two different ways, leading to global existence of potentials under natural conditions. A second order potential for the Ricci tensor is introduced.
We analyze the dynamics of the FRW models with global rotation in terms of dynamical system methods. We reduce the dynamics of these models to the FRW models with some fictitious fluid which scales like radiation matter. This fluid mimics dynamical effects of global rotation. The significance of the global rotation of the Universe for the resolution of the acceleration and horizon problems in cosmology is investigated. It is found that the dynamics of the Universe can be reduced to the two-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical system. Then the construction of the Hamiltonian allows for full classification of evolution paths. On the phase portraits we find the domains of cosmic acceleration for the globally rotating universe as well as the trajectories for which the horizon problem is solved. We show that the FRW models with global rotation are structurally stable. This proves that the universe acceleration is due to the global rotation. It is also shown how global rotation gives a natural explanation of the empirical relation between angular momentum for clusters and superclusters of galaxies. The relation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> ~ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em><sup>2</sup> is obtained as a consequence of self similarity invariance of the dynamics of the FRW model with global rotation. In derivation of this relation we use the Lie group of symmetry analysis of differential equation.
We present the full set of evolution equations for the spatially homogeneous cosmologies of type VI<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> filled with a tilted perfect fluid and we provide the corresponding equilibrium points of the resulting dynamical state space. It is found that only when the group parameter satisfies <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> &gt; −1 a self-similar solution exists. In particular we show that for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> &gt; −<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\frac{1}{9}}\)</span> there exists a self-similar equilibrium point provided that γ ∈ <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(({\frac{2(3+\sqrt{-h})}{5+3\sqrt{-h}}},{\frac{3}{2}})\)</span> whereas for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> &lt; −<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\frac 19}\)</span> the state parameter belongs to the interval γ ∈(1,<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\frac{2(3+\sqrt{-h})}{5+3\sqrt{-h}}})\)</span>. This family of new exact self-similar solutions belongs to the subclass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sub>α</sub><sup>α</sup> = 0 having non-zero vorticity. In both cases the equilibrium points have a six-dimensional stable manifold and may act as future attractors at least for the models satisfying <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em><sub>α</sub><sup>α</sup> = 0. Also we give the exact form of the self-similar metrics in terms of the state and group parameter. As an illustrative example we provide the explicit form of the corresponding self-similar radiation model (γ = <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\frac 43}\)</span>), parametrised by the group parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>. Finally we show that there are no tilted self-similar models of type III and irrotational models of type VI<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub>.
The modified gravity with 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> term (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> being the scalar curvature) and the Einstein-Hilbert term is studied by incorporating the phantom scalar field. A number of cosmological solutions are derived in the presence of the phantom field in the perfect fluid background. It is shown: the current inflation obtained in the modified gravity is affected by the existence of the phantom field.
We revisit the integral formulation (or Green’s function approach) of Einstein’s equations in the context of braneworlds. The integral formulation has been proposed independently by several authors in the past, based on the assumption that it possible to give a reinterpretation of the local metric field in curved spacetimes as an integral expression involving sources and boundary conditions. This allows one to separate source-generated and source-free contributions to the metric field. As a consequence, an exact meaning to Mach’s Principle can be achieved in the sense that only source-generated (matter fields) contributions to the metric are allowed for; universes which do not obey this condition would be non-Machian. In this paper, we revisit this idea concentrating on a Randall–Sundrum-type model with a non-trivial cosmology on the brane. We argue that the role of the surface term (the source-free contribution) in the braneworld scenario may be quite subtler than in the 4D formulation. This may pose, for instance, an interesting issue to the cosmological constant problem.
A static non-singular 10-dimensional closed Friedmann universe of Planck size, filled with a perfect fluid with equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = −<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>ε, can arise spontaneously by a quantum fluctuation from nothing in 11-dimensional spacetime. A quantum transition from this state can initiate the inflationary quantum cosmology outlined in [Gen. Relativ. Gravit. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">33</strong>, 1415 (2001)]. With no fine-tuning, that cosmology predicts about 60 e-folds of inflation and a vacuum energy density depending only on the number of extra space dimensions (seven), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>,ℏ, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> and the ratio between the strength of gravity and the strength of the strong force. The fraction of the total energy in the universe represented by this vacuum energy depends on the Hubble constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>0</sub>. Estimates of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>0</sub> from WMAP, SDSS, the Hubble Key Project, and Sunyaev-Zeldovich and X-ray flux measurements range from 60 to 72 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup>. Using a mid-range value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>0</sub> = 65 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup>, the model in [Gen. Relativ. Gravit. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">33</strong>, 1415 (2001)] predicts Ω <sub>Λ</sub>≈ 0.7.
We studied the expectation value of the scale factor in radiation and dust quantum perfect fluid cosmology. We used Schutz’s variational formalism to describe the perfect fluid and selected the conjugate coordinate of the perfect fluid to be the dynamical variable. After quantization and solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation we obtained an exact solution. By superposition of exact solutions, we obtained one wave packet and used it to compute the expectation value of the scale factor. We found that if one selects a different dynamical variable being the time variable in each of these two systems, the expectation value of the scale factor of these two systems can fit in with the prediction of General Relativity. Therefore we thought that the selection of a reference time can be different for different quantum perfect fluid systems.
The Klein-Gordon equation is applied to investigate superradiance around a dilatonic variant of dyonic black holes, a type of black holes whose extremal limits are justified for the S-wave approximation. The result is: The dilaton field boosts the superradiance.
Noether symmetry for scalar tensor theory including curvature quadratic term has been explored, with the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Introduction of an auxiliary variable in the action facilitates in transforming the fourth order field equations to the second order field equations. Introduction of Noether symmetry in the action yield the coupling function ω(φ) and the potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>(φ). The application of Noether symmetry further turned out to be powerful tool to find the solution of the field equations. A few physically reasonable solutions like power law inflation are presented.
The historical route and the current status of a curvature-squared model of gravity, in the affine form proposed by Yang, is briefly reviewed. Due to its inherent scale invariance, it enjoys some advantage for quantization, similarly as internal Yang-Mills fields. However, the exact vacuum solutions with double duality properties exhibit a ‘vacuum degeneracy’. By modifying the duality via a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">scale breaking</em> term, we demonstrate that only the Einstein equations with induced cosmological constant emerge for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classical</em> background, even when coupled to matter sources.



We apply a covariant and generic procedure to obtain explicit expressions of the transverse frames that a type I spacetime admits in terms of an arbitrary initial frame. We also present a simple and general algorithm to obtain the Weyl scalars Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>2</sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> </sup> </span>, Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>0</sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> </sup> </span> and Ψ<span class="Stack"> <sub>4</sub> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> </sup> </span> associated with these transverse frames. In both cases it is only necessary to choose a particular root of a cubic expression.
In this work we extend an analysis due to Visser of the effective propagation of a neutral scalar particle on a brane world scenario which is a particular solution of the five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations with cosmological constant having an electric field pointing in the extra spatial dimension. We determine the dispersion relations of a charged scalar particle to first order in a perturbative analysis around those of the neutral particle. Since depending on whether the particle is charged or not the dispersion relations change, we could collect bulk information, namely the presence of the electric field, by studying the 4D dynamics of the particles.
We present a new solution of the Dirac equation in the background of a plane wave metric. We examine the relation between sections of the exterior and Clifford bundles of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold. A spinor calculus is established and used to investigate a new solution of the Dirac equation lying in a minimal left ideal characterized by a certain idempotent projector.
The properties of an asymptotically flat spacetime with a mass and a magnetic dipole are studied. We focus on the breaking of spherical symmetry by the magnetic dipole. We investigate the geometry of the spacetime through the trajectories of null geodesics and the embedding diagrams of various hypersurfaces, included constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> surfaces and the infinite red shift surface. We find that the effects of the magnetic dipole on the spacetime are larger at the poles than on the equator.
In this paper we explore the possibility of suitably combining the nodes Ω of the existing geodetic LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and Ajisai laser-ranged satellites and of the radar altimeter Jason–1 satellite in order to increase the accuracy in testing the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense–Thirring secular effect in the gravitational field of the Earth. The proposal of introducing Ajisai and Jason–1 in such a combination comes from the expected benefits which could be obtained in reducing the aliasing secular impact of the classical part of the terrestrial gravitational field. According to the recently released EIGEN-CG01C combined GRACE + CHAMP + terrestrial gravimetry/altimetry Earth gravity model, the impact of the static part of the mismodelled even zonal harmonics of geopotential, which represent the major source of systematic error, amounts to 1.6%, at 1−σ level. It is better than the error which could be obtained with a two-node LAGEOS-LAGEOS II only combination (6% at 1−σ). Moreover, the proposed combination would be insensitive also to the secular variations of the low-degree even zonal harmonics, contrary to the LAGEOS-LAGEOS II only combination. Such variations could be a serious limiting factor over observational time spans many years long. The price to be paid for this improvements of the systematic error of gravitational origin is represented by the non-conservative forces introduced along with the new orbital elements. However, they would induce periodic perturbations, contrary to the gravitational noise. A major concern would be the assessment of the impact of the non-conservative accelerations on the Jason–1 node. According to the present-day force models, the mismodelling in the non-conservative forces would, at worst, induce an aliasing periodic signal with an amplitude of 4% of the Lense-Thirring effect over a time span of 2 years. However, an observational time span of just some years could safely be adopted in order to fit and remove the residual long–period non-gravitational signals affecting Jason’s node, which, in the case of the direct solar radiation pressure, have a main periodicity of approximately 120 days. Of course, the possibility of getting time series of the Jason’s node some years long should be demonstrated in reality.
We present a new point of view on the quantization of the massive gravitational field, namely we use exclusively the quantum framework of the second quantization. The Hilbert space of the many-gravitons system is a Fock space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em><sup>+</sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>graviton</sub>) where the one-particle Hilbert space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>graviton</sub> carries the direct sum of two unitary irreducible representations of the Poincaré group corresponding to two particles of mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> &gt; 0 and spins 2 and 0, respectively. This Hilbert space is canonically isomorphic to a space of the type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ker</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>)/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Im</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>) where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> is a gauge charge defined in an extension of the Hilbert space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em><sub>graviton</sub> generated by the gravitational field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em><sub>μν</sub> and some ghosts fields <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em><sub>μ</sub>, ũ<sub>μ</sub> (which are vector Fermi fields) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em><sub>μ</sub> (which is a vector Bose field).</p><p class="Para">Then we study the self interaction of massive gravity in the causal framework. We obtain a solution which goes smoothly to the zero-mass solution of linear quantum gravity up to a term depending on the bosonic ghost field. This solution depends on two real constants as it should be; these constants are related to the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant. In the second order of the perturbation theory we do not need a Higgs field, in sharp contrast to Yang-Mills theory.
We use numerical integrations to study the asymptotical behaviour of a homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">IX</em> model in General Relativity with a massive scalar field. As it is well known, for a Brans-Dicke theory, the asymptotical behaviour of the metric functions is ruled only by the Brans-Dicke coupling constant ω<sub>0</sub> with respect to the value −3/2. In this paper we examine if such a condition still exists with a massive scalar field. We also show that, contrary to what occurs for a massless scalar field, the singularity oscillatory approach may exist in the presence of a massive scalar field having a positive energy density.
It is confirmed rigorously that the Killing–Cauchy horizons, which sometimes occur in space-times representing the collision and subsequent interaction of plane gravitational waves in a Minkowski background, are <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unstable</em> with respect to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bounded</em> perturbations of the initial waves, at least for the case in which the initial waves have constant aligned polarizations.
We show that the shell-universe model (used to explain the observed expansion rate of the universe without a dark energy component) provides a natural mechanism for local increasing of the brane tension leading to the modified Newton’s law alternative to galactic dark matter.
Brillouin scattering of photons off the density fluctuations in a fluid is potentially important for cosmology. We derive the Brillouin spectral distortion of blackbody radiation, and discuss the possible implications for the cosmic microwave background. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect is slightly modified by Brillouin distortion, but only at very long wavelengths.
If it becomes possible to test general relativity by laboratory experiments on rotation, the ratios of mass to angular momentum per unit mass are likely to be extremely small. Solutions for a rotating body with low <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> are therefore of interest. Here I discuss Papapetrou’s exact solution, which has zero mass and arbitrary angular momentum.
A recent paper claiming to have found the true general vacuum solution of the locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type IX spatially homogeneous Einstein equations already found by Taub in <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span> rediscovers that solution.
A work, recently published by this journal, is discussed and the critique is presented in this same issue. Our revision of this critique is focused on two main topics: a) the suggested Taub solution and (b) the method followed to arrive at it.
We complete the historical overview about the geometry of a Schwarzschild black hole at its horizon by emphasizing the contribution made by Synge in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">6</a></span>] to its clarification.

It is found from Maxwell’s equations that the magnetic field lines are good analogues of relativistic strings. The Lorentz force per unit length of magnetic tube is interpretable as Magnus force acting on each individual magnetic tube. It is shown that the superconducting current in pulsar’s interior causes local rotation of magnetic flux tubes carrying quantized flux. Such local rotation remains operative as long as the induced magnetic field of normal electron fluid is above the lower critical field but below the upper. The conservation of magnetic flux leads to a geometrical condition in the form of the Weingarten identity which ensures the existence of family of “magnetic world sheetrdquo;. Each “magnetic world sheet” is a magnetic flux conserving surface. In the process of collapse, a compact spacelike cross-section of a magnetic tube terminates into a trapped surface if the magnetic energy grows faster along the fluid flow lines than that along the magnetic field lines.
Abstract New exact interior solutions to the Einstein field equations for anisotropic spheres are found. We utilise a procedure that necessitates a choice for the energy density and the radial pressure. This class contains the constant density model of Maharaj and Maartens (Gen. Rel. Grav. 21, 899–905 (1989)), and the variable density model of Gokhroo and Mehra (Gen. Rel. Grav. 26, 75–84 (1994)), as special cases. These anisotropic spheres match smoothly to the Schwarzschild exterior and gravitational potentials are well behaved in the interior. A graphical analysis of the matter variables is performed which points to a physically reasonable matter distribution.
When sources are added at their right-hand sides, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ik</em>)</sub> is a priori assumed to be the metric, the equations of Einstein’s Hermitian theory of relativity were shown to allow for an exact solution that describes the general electrostatic field of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> point charges. Moreover, the injunction of spherical symmetry of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ik</em>)</sub> in the infinitesimal neighbourhood of each of the charges was proved to yield the equilibrium conditions of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> charges in keeping with ordinary electrostatics. The tensor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em><sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ik</em>)</sub>, however, cannot be the metric of the theory, since it enters neither the eikonal equation nor the equation of motion of uncharged test particles. A physically correct metric that rules both the behaviour of wave fronts and of uncharged matter is the one indicated by Hély.</p><p class="Para">In the present paper it is shown how the electrostatic solution predicts the structure of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> charged particles and their mutual positions of electrostatic equilibrium when Hély’s physically correct metric is adopted.
We present the analytical solution to the linear evolution equation of a one component Friedmann perturbation using an equation of state of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (1/3)μσ<sup>2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>), where μ is the mass density and σ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) is the root mean square (rms) velocity in the matter dominated epoch. It is assumed that this rms velocity depends only on the time coordinate and decreases as 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> being the expansion factor of the Friedmann background. The evolution equations are written for scales below the horizon using the longitudinal gauge. The general solution, in the coordinate space, of the evolution equation for the scalar mode is obtained. In the case of spherical symmetry, this solution is expressed in terms of unidimensional integrals of the initial conditions: the initial values of the Newtonian potential and its first time derivative. This perfect fluid solution is a good approximation to the evolution of warm dark matter perturbations obtained by solving the Vlasov’s equation for collisionless particles.
The quantum entropies due to the scalar and Dirac fields are investigated in a pure de Sitter spacetime. The leading divergent terms in both cases are regularized by the Pauli-Villars scheme. It is shown that the explosive entropies can be renormalized according to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.
In previous works, we studied the isotropisation of some Bianchi class <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> models with a minimally coupled scalar field. In this paper we extend these results, in the special case of a Bianchi type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> model, to a non minimally coupled scalar field. The Universe isotropisation for the Brans-Dicke and low energy string theories are studied.
We extend the derivation of the Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter black holes is obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle of string theory and non-commutative geometry. This may explain why the thermodynamics of (anti-)de Sitter-like black holes admits a holographic description in terms of a dual quantum conformal field theory, whereas the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like black holes does not.
The periastron position advance for geodesic motion in axially symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations belonging to the Weyl class of vacuum solutions is investigated. Explicit examples corresponding to either static solutions (single Chazy-Curzon, Schwarzschild and a pair of them), or stationary solutions (single rotating Chazy-Curzon and Kerr black hole) are discussed. The results are then applied to the case of S2-SgrA<sup>*</sup> binary system of which the periastron position advance will be soon measured with a great accuracy.
Necessary conditions for various algebraic types of the Weyl tensor in higher dimensions are determined. These conditions are then used to find Weyl aligned null directions for the black ring solution. It is shown that the black ring solution is algebraically special, of type I<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>, while locally on the horizon the type is II. One exceptional subclass – the Myers-Perry solution – is of type D.
We obtain an exact solution for the Einstein’s equations with cosmological constant coupled to a scalar, static particle in static, “spherically” symmetric background in (2+1)-dimensions.
In string theory, stabilization of moduli fields and their cosmological implications have been discussed by many authors. In this paper, we consider the relative positions of three intersecting branes. Surprisingly, there had been no phenomenological and cosmological argument on the mechanism that stabilizes the corresponding parameter. We show that the area of the triangle is not a free parameter. The effective potential is generated from loop corrections in the low energy effective Lagrangian, where supersymmetry is expected to be broken. The stabilization of the area of such triangles will determine the Yukawa couplings that have been considered as the free parameters of the intersecting brane models. The stabilization puts a constraint on the model, which is different from the other requirements that have been discussed before. We also discuss cosmological problems and then show an idea that may solve the problem.
Models with varying cosmic parameters, which were earlier regarded constant, are getting attention. However, different models are usually invoked to explain the evolution of different parameters. We argue that whatever physical process is responsible for the evolution of one parameter, should also be responsible for the evolution of others. This means that the different parameters are coupled together somehow. Based on this guiding principle, we investigate a Bianchi type I model with variable Λ and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, in which Λ, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and the shear parameter σ<sup>2</sup>, all are coupled. It is interesting that the resulting model reduces to the FLRW model for large <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> approaching a constant.
We study the static black hole solutions of generalized two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories generated by pointlike mass sources, in the hypothesis that the matter is conformally coupled.</p><p class="Para">We also discuss the motion of test particles. Due to conformal coupling, these follow the geodesics of a metric obtained by rescaling the canonical metric with the dilaton.
The real scalar field equation between the outer black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon is solved in the extreme Reissner-Nordström de Sitter (RNdS) space. We use an accurate approximation, the polynomial approximation, to approximate the tortoise coordinate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) in order to get the inverse function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>) and then to solve the wave equation. The case where the two horizons are very close to each other is discussed in detail. We find that the wave function is harmonic only in the very small regions near the horizons, and the amplitude decreases remarkably near the potential peak because of the effect of the potential. Furthermore, it is found that the height of the potential increases as the cosmological constant Λ decreases, and the wave amplitude will decrease more remarkably with less Λ.



We show the geometrical equivalence of two five-dimensional metrics, one describing a cosmology which smoothly embeds the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-Lemaître models, and another describing an object which topologically is a black hole. The solutions can be interpreted using either membrane or induced-matter theory. We outline the main physics, wherein the horizon of the black hole is connected to a big bounce in the cosmology, which may in turn be connected to a phase change in the vacuum.
As an example of a dynamical cosmological black hole, a spacetime that describes an expanding black hole in the asymptotic background of the Einstein-de Sitter universe is constructed. The black hole is primordial in the sense that it forms <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab initio</em> with the big bang singularity and its expanding event horizon is represented by a conformal Killing horizon. The metric representing the black hole spacetime is obtained by applying a time dependent conformal transformation on the Schwarzschild metric, such that the result is an exact solution with a matter content described by a two-fluid source. Physical quantities such as the surface gravity and other effects like perihelion precession, light bending and circular orbits are studied in this spacetime and compared to their counterparts in the gravitational field of the isolated Schwarzschild black hole. No changes in the structure of null geodesics are recorded, but significant differences are obtained for timelike geodesics, particularly an increase in the perihelion precession and the non-existence of circular timelike orbits. The solution is expressed in the Newman-Penrose formalism.
A new, globally regular model describing a static, non spherical gravitating object in General Relativity is presented. The model is composed by a vacuum Weyl–Levi-Civita special field – the so called gamma metric – generated by a regular static distribution of mass-energy. Standard requirements of physical reasonableness such as, energy, matching and regularity conditions are satisfied. The model is used as a toy in investigating various issues related to the directional behavior of naked singularities in static spacetimes and the black hole (Schwarzschild) limit.
Among the several proposals to solve the incompatibility between the observed small value of the cosmological constant and the huge value obtained by quantum field theories, we can find the idea of a decaying vacuum energy density, leading from high values at early times of universe evolution to the small value observed nowadays. In this paper we consider a variation law for the vacuum density recently proposed by Schützhold on the basis of quantum field estimations in the curved, expanding background, characterized by a vacuum density proportional to the Hubble parameter. We show that, in the context of an isotropic and homogeneous, spatially flat model, the corresponding solutions retain the well established features of the standard cosmology, and, in addition, are in accordance with the observed cosmological parameters. Our scenario presents an initial phase dominated by radiation, followed by a dust era long enough to permit structure formation, and by an epoch dominated by the cosmological term, which tends asymptotically to a de Sitter universe. Taking the matter density equals to half of the vacuum energy density, as suggested by observation, we obtain a universe age given by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ht</em> = 1.1, and a decelerating parameter equals to −1/2.
Static cylindrical shells composed of massive particles arising from matching of two different Levi–Civita space-times are studied for the shell satisfying either an isotropic or an anisotropic equation of state. We find that these solutions satisfy the energy conditions for certain ranges of the parameters.
In the present work we analyze the possibility of detecting some deformed dispersion relations, emerging in some quantum-gravity models, resorting to the so-called Hanbury–Brown–Twiss effect. It will be proved that in some scenarios the possibilities are not pessimistic. Forsooth, for some values of the corresponding parameters the aforementioned effect could render interesting outcomes.
Using the quasi-normal modes frequency of near extremal Schwar-zschild-de Sitter black holes, we obtain area and entropy spectrum for the black hole horizon. By using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization for an adiabatic invariant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> = ∫<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dE</em>ω(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>), where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> is the energy of the system and ω(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>) is the vibrational frequency, we arrive at an equally spaced mass spectrum. In the other terms, we extend directly the Kunstatter’s approach kun [6] to determine mass and entropy spectrum of near extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes which are asymptotically de Sitter rather than asymptotically flat. We show the mass and area spectrum is equally spaced only for a fixed <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>. For different <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> there are multiplets with different values of spacing.
The creation of the inflationary brane universe in 5d bulk Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is considered. We demonstrate that the emerging universe is ambiguous due to arbitrary function dependence of the junction conditions (or freedom in the choice of boundary terms). We argue that some fundamental physical principle (which may be related with AdS/CFT correspondence) is necessary in order to fix the 4d geometry in a unique way.
A ‘radical’ conservative unifying model of scalar dark matter and modified gravity is proposed here. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">singular</em> but also bifurcates into several <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">almost Einsteinian spaces</em>, distinguished only by a different gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail or butterfly <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">catastrophe</em> in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This finding may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on ‘dark energy’, regarded as an effective cosmological constant.
Spherical reduction of generic four-dimensional theories is revisited. Three different notions of “spherical symmetry” are defined. The following sectors are investigated: Einstein-Cartan theory, spinors, (non-)abelian gauge fields and scalar fields. In each sector a different formalism seems to be most convenient: the Cartan formulation of gravity works best in the purely gravitational sector, the Einstein formulation is convenient for the Yang-Mills sector and for reducing scalar fields, and the Newman-Penrose formalism seems to be the most transparent one in the fermionic sector. Combining them the spherically reduced Standard Model of particle physics together with the usually omitted gravity part can be presented as a two-dimensional (dilaton gravity) theory.



We study here what it means for the Universe to be nearly flat, as opposed to exactly flat. We give three definitions of nearly flat, based on density, geometry and dynamics; all three definitions are equivalent and depend on a single constant flatness parameter ɛ that quantifies the notion of nearly flat. Observations can only place an upper limit on ɛ, and always allow the possibility that the Universe is infinite with k = −1 or finite with k = 1. We use current observational data to obtain a numerical upper limit on the flatness parameter and discuss its implications, in particular the “naturalness” of the nearly flat Universe.
The assumption that an ensemble of classical particles is subject to nonclassical momentum fluctuations, with the fluctuation uncertainty fully determined by the position uncertainty, has been shown to lead from the classical equations of motion to the Schrödinger equation. This ‘exact uncertainty’ approach may be generalised to ensembles of gravitational fields, where nonclassical fluctuations are added to the field momentum densities, of a magnitude determined by the uncertainty in the metric tensor components. In this way one obtains the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum gravity, with the added bonus of a uniquely specified operator ordering. No <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a priori</em> assumptions are required concerning the existence of wave functions, Hilbert spaces, Planck's constant, linear operators, etc. Thus this approach has greater transparency than the usual canonical approach, particularly in regard to the connections between quantum and classical ensembles. Conceptual foundations and advantages are emphasised.
The software tool <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GRworkbench</em> is an ongoing project in visual, numerical General Relativity at The Australian National University. Recently, the numerical differential geometric engine of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GRworkbench</em> has been rewritten using functional programming techniques. By allowing functions to be directly represented as program variables in C++ code, the functional framework enables the mathematical formalism of Differential Geometry to be more closely reflected in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GRworkbench</em>. The powerful technique of ‘automatic differentiation’ has replaced numerical differentiation of the metric components, resulting in more accurate derivatives and an order-of-magnitude performance increase for operations relying on differentiation.
There is an apparent discrepancy in the literature with regard to the quasinormal-mode frequencies of Schwarzschild–de Sitter black holes in the degenerate-horizon limit. On the one hand, a Poschl–Teller-inspired method predicts that the real part of the frequencies will depend strongly on the orbital angular momentum of the perturbation field whereas, on the other hand, the degenerate limit of a monodromy-based calculation suggests there should be no such dependence (at least, for the highly damped modes). In the current paper, we provide a possible resolution by critically re-assessing the limiting procedure used in the monodromy analysis.
How much of modern cosmology is really cosmography? How much of modern cosmology is independent of the Einstein equations? (Independent of the Friedmann equations?) These questions are becoming increasingly germane—as the models cosmologists use for the stress-energy content of the universe become increasingly baroque, it behaves us to step back a little and carefully disentangle cosmological kinematics from cosmological dynamics. The use of basic symmetry principles (such as the cosmological principle) permits us to do a considerable amount, without ever having to address the vexatious issues of just how much “dark energy”, “dark matter”, “quintessence”, and/or “phantom matter” is needed in order to satisfy the Einstein equations. This is the sub-sector of cosmology that Weinberg refers to as “cosmography”, and in this article I will explore the extent to which cosmography is sufficient for analyzing the Hubble law and so describing many of the features of the universe around us.
Over the last few years numerous papers concerning analogue models of (and for) gravity have been published. It has been shown that the dynamical equations for several condensed matter systems, (e.g., simple fluids, superfluids, Bose–Einstein condensates with a sink or a vortex) permit perturbations that are governed by the same type of wave equation as light in a curved spacetime—the curved-space d'Alembertian equation. More recently, several papers have been released which use analogue models to simulate the expanding universe. In this article the de Sitter universe will be simulated using a freely expanding three-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate with spherical symmetry. Initially the condensate is in a harmonic trap, which is then suddenly switched off. At the same time a small perturbation is injected in the center of the condensate cloud. The motion of this perturbation in the expanding condensate will be discussed, and (after some transformations) the similarity of this system to an expanding universe will be exhibited. Finally, we briefly discuss questions of experimental observability of these effects.
A new geometric approximation scheme, designed to solve the covariant Maxwell equations inside a rotating hollow slender conducting cavity (modelling a ring-laser) on a background spacetime, is constructed. It is shown that for well-defined conditions the electromagnetic spectrum splits into TE- and TM-type modes. A twisted mode spectrum is found to depend on the integrated Frenet torsion of the cavity and this in turn may affect the Sagnac beat frequency induced by a non-zero rotation of the cavity.
We describe a novel off-axis Hartmann wavefront sensor, developed for the measurement of wavefront distortions induced in the mirrors (test masses) of advanced gravitational wave interferometers by residual absorption of the circulating laser power.
Thermal lensing is becoming recognized as one of the dominant obstacles to the second generation of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Very high optical power is required to circulate in the interferometer to reach the sensitivity goal, creating strong thermal induced wavefront distortion. These effects will be studied at the High Optical Power Test Facility in Gingin, Western Australia. In this paper, we present simulation results for the first test planned for the middle of 2004. This experiment will produce 5 kW of optical power circulating inside a Fabry–Perot cavity and will demonstrate large thermal lensing effects.</p><p class="Para">Two compensation methods were investigated to offset the negative effect of thermal lensing on the cavity: a compensation plate within the arm cavity and adaptive laser mode matching. Advantages and disadvantages of both systems are discussed.
A bench-top auto-alignment system employing an invariant Gouy phase telescope is described in this paper. Our system uses external galvanometer-actuated mirrors for the tilt and offset control of a laser beam onto a rigid spacer cavity. Wavefront sensing diagnostics which accurately decouple tilt and offset er-rors are employed, and corresponding orthogonal corrections are enabled with the aid of electronic nulling. The closed loop system achieves an alignment fluctua-tion suppression of 50.4 dB for angular tilt and 58.3 dB for lateral offset at 1 Hz, with a unity gain bandwidth in excess of 115 Hz.
In this paper we report on the alignment locking of an in vacuum 77 m long suspended mirror Fabry-Perot cavity. Lock was achieved by mode-matching a 500 mW Nd:YAG NPRO onto a pre-mode cleaner, the output of which was then mode-matched to the suspended cavity. The longitudinal locking was achieved by feeding back to the laser frequency actuator to follow the cavity resonance. Subsequent implementation of a hybrid auto-alignment system enhanced the stability of the circulating power inside the cavity. Preliminary results are presented.
Laser beam geometry variations such as beam jitter and frequency fluctuations are a critical source of noise in the output signal of a laser interferometer gravitational wave detector. In order to minimise this noise a resonant vibration isolated optical filter or mode-cleaner is required. For advanced gravitational wave detectors such a mode-cleaner is required to be able to handle transmitted power ∼100 W, and an internal circulating power of 45 kW. This paper addresses the design requirements of such a mode-cleaner. We characterise the mode-cleaner requirements and the effects of high laser power on the optics and its consequence on the suppression of higher order modes.
Homogeneous cosmology in the braneworld can be studied without solving bulk equations of motion explicitly. The reason is simply because the symmetry of the spacetime restricts possible corrections in the 4-dimensional effective equations of motion. It would be great if we could analyze cosmological perturbations without solving the bulk. For this purpose, we combine the geometrical approach and the low energy gradient expansion method to derive the 4-dimensional effective action. Given our effective action, the standard procedure to obtain the cosmological perturbation theory can be utilized and the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation can be computed without solving the bulk equations of motion explicitly.
The static potential for a massless scalar field shares the essential features of the scalar gravitational mode in a tensorial perturbation analysis about the background solution. Using the fluxbrane construction of [8] we calculate the lowest order of the static potential of a massless scalar field on a thin brane using series solutions to the scalar field's Klein Gordon equation and we find that it has the same form as Newton's Law of Gravity. We claim our method will in general provide a quick and useful check that one may use to see if their model will recover Newton's Law to lowest order on the brane.
Primordial black hole formation by cosmic string collapses is reconsidered in the case where the winding number of the string is larger than unity. The line energy density of a multiple winding string becomes greater than that of a single winding string so that the probability of black hole formation by string collapse during loop oscillation would be strongly enhanced. Moreover, this probability could be affected by changes in gravity theory due to large extra dimensions based on the brane universe model. In addition, a wider class of strings which are stable compared to conventional cosmic strings can contribute to such a scenario. Although the production of the multiple winding defect is suppressed and its number density should be small, the enhancement of black hole formation by the increased energy density may provide a large number of evaporating black holes in the present universe which gives more stringent constraints on the string model compared to the ordinary string scenario.


Generic cosmological models in non-critical string theory have a time-dependent dilaton background at a late epoch. The cosmological deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>0</sub> is given by the square of the string coupling, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> <sup>2</sup>, up to a negative sign. Hence the expansion of the Universe must accelerate eventually, and the observed value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>0</sub> corresponds to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> <sup>2</sup> ∼ 0.6. In this scenario, the string coupling is asymptotically free at large times, but its present rate of change is imperceptibly small.
If our universe underwent inflation, its entropy during the inflationary phase was substantially lower than it is today. Because a low-entropy state is less likely to be chosen randomly than a high-entropy one, inflation is unlikely to arise through randomly-chosen initial conditions. To resolve this puzzle, we examine the notion of a natural state for the universe, and argue that it is a nearly-empty spacetime. If empty space has a small vacuum energy, however, inflation can begin spontaneously in this background. This scenario explains why a universe like ours is likely to have begun via a period of inflation, and also provides an origin for the cosmological arrow of time.
In general relativity, gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, and so gravitons are massless. The masslessness can be traced to symmetry under diffeomorphisms. However, another elegant possibility exists: masslessness can instead arise from spontaneous violation of local Lorentz invariance. We construct the corresponding theory of gravity. It reproduces the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity at low energies and temperatures. Detectable signals occur for sensitive experiments, and potentially profound implications emerge for our theoretical understanding of gravity.
If string theory is correct, then our observable Universe may be a 3-dimensional “brane” embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This theoretical scenario should be tested via the state-of-the-art in gravitational experiments—the current and upcoming gravity-wave detectors. Indeed, the existence of extra dimensions leads to oscillations that leave a spectroscopic signature in the gravity-wave signal from black holes. The detectors that have been designed to confirm Einstein's prediction of gravity waves, can in principle also provide tests and constraints on string theory.
We argue that recent developments in discretizations of classical and quantum gravity imply a new paradigm for doing research in these areas. The paradigm consists in discretizing the theory in such a way that the resulting discrete theory has no constraints. This solves many of the hard conceptual problems of quantum gravity. It also appears as a useful tool in some numerical simulations of interest in classical relativity. We outline some of the salient aspects and results of this new framework.
In this paper, we investigate the quintessence model with a minimally coupled scalar field in the context of recent supernovae observations. By choosing a particular form of the deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>, which gives an early deceleration and late time acceleration for the dust dominated model, we show that this sign flip in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> can be obtained by a simple trigonometric potential. The early matter dominated model expands with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> = 1/2 as desired and enters a negative <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> phase quite late during the evolution.
The paper addresses matrix spaces, whose properties and dynamics are determined by Dirac matrices in Riemannian spaces of different dimension and signature. Among all Dirac matrix systems there are such ones, which nontrivial scalar, vector or other tensors cannot be made up from. These Dirac matrix systems are associated with the vacuum state of the matrix space. The simplest vacuum system realization can be ensured using the orthonormal basis in the internal matrix space. This vacuum system realization, however, is not unique. The case of 7-dimensional Riemannian space of signature 7(−) is considered in detail. In this case two basically different vacuum system realizations are possible: (1) with using the orthonormal basis; (2) with using the oblique-angled basis, whose base vectors coincide with the simple roots of the Lie algebra <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> <sub>8</sub>.</p><p class="Para">Considerations are presented, from which it follows that the least-dimen-si-on space bearing on physics is the Riemannian 11-dimensional space of signature 1(−)&amp; 10(+). The considerations consist in the condition of maximum vacuum energy density and vacuum fluctuation energy density.
We describe conditions assuring that the Kerr–Schild type solutions of Einstein's equations with pure radiation fields are asymptotically flat at future null infinity. Such metrics cannot describe “true” gravitational radiation from bounded sources—it is shown that the Bondi news function vanishes identically. We obtain formulae for the total energy and angular momentum at ℐ. As an example we consider a non-stationary generalization of the Kerr metric given by Vaidya and Patel. Angular momentum and total energy are expressed in closed form as functions of retarded time.
The material tensor of linear response in electrodynamics is constructed out of products of two symmetric second rank tensor fields which in the approximation of geometrical optics and for uniaxial symmetry reduce to “optical” metrics, describing the phenomenon of birefringence. This representation is interpreted in the context of an underlying internal geometrical structure according to which the symmetric tensor fields are vectorial elements of an associated two-dimensional space.
A new class of algebraically special solutions is found for Einstein's equations based on the generalised Robinson-Trautman formulation introduced by Wainwright. The solution metrics depend on all four spacetime coordinates <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>, and in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> subspace are either spherically symmetric (parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> <sub>0</sub> &gt; 0) or spatially flat (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> <sub>0</sub> = 0). The inhomogeneous spacetimes, of Petrov type II, have singularities at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = 0 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0. The source is a stiff perfect fluid that expands with shear and acceleration but without rotation. The dynamical configuration in the era <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> ∼ 0 depends directly on a function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em>) of the metric. Trapped surfaces are found, associated with the singularity <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0, which is shown to be censored.
We consider the extension of the Majumdar-type class of static solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell equations proposed by Ida to include charged perfect fluid sources. We impose the equation of state ρ+3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = 0 and discuss spherically symmetric solutions for the linear potential equation satisfied by the metric. In this particular case the fluid charge density vanishes and we locate the arising neutral perfect fluid in the intermediate region defined by two thin shells with respective charges <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> and −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>. With its innermost flat and external (Schwarzschild) asymptotically flat spacetime regions, the resultant condenser-like geometries resemble solutions discussed by Cohen and Cohen in a different context. We explore this relationship and point out an exotic gravitational property of our neutral perfect fluid. We mention possible continuations of this study to embrace non-spherically symmetric situations and higher dimensional spacetimes.

A binary system composed of an oscillating and rotating coplanar dusty disk and a point mass is considered. The conservative dynamics is treated on the Newtonian level. The effects of gravitational radiation reaction and wave emission are studied to leading quadrupole order. The related waveforms are given. The dynamical evolution of the system is determined semi-analytically exploiting the Hamiltonian equations of motion which comprise the effects both of the Newtonian tidal interaction and the radiation reaction on the motion of the binary system in elliptic orbits. Tidal resonance effects between orbital and oscillatory motions are considered in the presence of radiation damping.
We obtain the electrostatic energy of two opposite charges near the horizon of stationary black holes in the massive Schwinger model. Besides the confining aspects of the model, we discuss the Bekenstein entropy upper bound of a charged object using the generalized second law. We show that despite the massless case, in the massive Schwinger model the entropy of the black hole and consequently the Bekenstein bound are altered by the vacuum polarization.
We consider five dimensional deSitter spacetimes with a deficit angle due to the presence of a closed 2-brane and identify one dimension as an extra dimension. From the four dimensional viewpoint we can see that the spacetime has a structure similar to a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing, that is, four dimensional spacetime ends at the 2-brane. Since a spatial section of the full deSitter spacetime has the topology of a sphere, the boundary surface surrounds the remaining four dimensional spacetime, and can be considered as the celestial sphere. After the spacetime is created from nothing via an instanton which we describe, some four dimensional observers in it see the celestial sphere falling down, and will be in contact with a 2-brane attached on it.
We examine two electrovac spacetimes, the Kerr-Newman solution and another due to Perjes, which represent single charged, rotating, magnetic objects. Both contain regions with closed timelike curves (CTC), but these regions would be covered by the sources in any physical realisation of the spacetimes, so the CTC would not be detectable. We then study a stationary solution referring to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">two</em> charged, rotating, magnetic objects. In general there is a region of CTC between the objects no matter how far apart they are. In this case the region would not be covered by the sources, and CTC would be detectable in principle.
In the context of the natural splitting, the standard relative dynamics can be expressed in terms of gravito-electromagnetic fields, which allow to formally introduce a gravito-magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect. We showed elsewhere that this formal analogy can be used to derive the Sagnac effect in flat space-time as a gravito-magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect. Here, we generalize those results to study the General Relativistic corrections to the Sagnac effect in some stationary and axially symmetric geometries, such as the space-time around a weakly gravitating and rotating source, Kerr space-time, Gödel universe and Schwarzschild space-time.
Scattering of electromagnetic waves by static and traversable wormholes is discussed. Based on the fact that these spacetimes have no horizon, and regarding their non-trivial topology, we have developed the perturbation theory of scattering and the Born approximation for obtaining the differential scattering cross section. Some of the zeros of the scattering pattern at long wavelengths are determined which can be used for estimating the radius of the throat. The known result that in scattering by static spacetimes the linear polarization remains unchanged is verified here.
We consider a Vaidya-type radiating spacetime in Einstein gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet combination of quadratic curvature terms. Simply generalizing the known static black hole solutions in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we present an exact solution in arbitrary dimensions with the energy-momentum tensor given by a null fluid form. As an application, we derive an evolution equation for the “dark radiation” in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld.
We demonstrate that a spherical accretion onto astrophysical black holes, under the influence of Newtonian or various post-Newtonian pseudo-Schwarzschild gravitational potentials, may constitute a concrete example of classical analogue gravity naturally found in the Universe. We analytically calculate the corresponding analogue Hawking temperature as a function of the minimum number of physical parameters governing the accretion flow. We study both the polytropic and the isothermal accretion. We show that unlike in a general relativistic spherical accretion, analogue white hole solutions can never be obtained in such post-Newtonian systems. We also show that an isothermal spherical accretion is a remarkably simple example in which the only one information–the temperature of the fluid, is sufficient to completely describe an analogue gravity system. For both types of accretion, the analogue Hawking temperature may become higher than the usual Hawking temperature. However, the analogue Hawking temperature for accreting astrophysical black holes is considerably lower compared with the temperature of the accreting fluid.
Alternative theories of gravity have been recently studied in connection with their cosmological applications, both in the Palatini and in the metric formalism. The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework (in the Palatini formalism) to test these theories at the solar system level and possibly at the galactic scales. We exactly solve field equations in vacuum and find the corresponding corrections to the standard general relativistic gravitational field. On the other hand, approximate solutions are found in matter cases starting from a Lagrangian which depends on a phenomenological parameter. Both in the vacuum case and in the matter case the deviations from General Relativity are controlled by parameters that provide the Post-Newtonian corrections which prove to be in good agreement with solar system experiments.
The circular noise is important in connection to Mach's principle, and also as a possible probe of the Unruh effect. In this letter the power spectrum of the detector following the Trocheries-Takeno motion in the Minkowski vacuum is analytically obtained in the form of an infinite series. A mean distribution function and corresponding energy density are obtained for this particular detected noise. The analogous of a non constant temperature distribution is obtained. And in the end, a brief discussion about the equilibrium configuration is given.
The Einstein-Maxwell equations for non-static charged shear-free spherically symmetric perfect fluid distribution reduce to a second-order non-linear differential equation in the radial parameter. Several solutions of this equation have been obtained in earlier work without considering the general requirement for physical relevance of the solutions. Generally physically acceptable relativistic fluid models demand that the solutions satisfy the reality conditions ρ ≥ 0, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> ≥ 0, ρ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> </sub> ≤ 0, etc. throughout the fluid model. In this article the expression for density gradient ρ <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> </sub> (or ρ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> </sub>) has been utilized to produce charged shear-free relativistic fluid models with non-positive density gradient (NDG)ρ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> </sub> ≤ 0. Eventually, we have found that none of the Riccati solutions have NDG including Vaidya metric. Also, the solutions with NDG neither possess Lie-symmetries nor Painlevé property. Further, it is observed that the solutions with NDG have no uncharged analogue.
Four-dimensional Riemannian spacetimes with two commuting spacelike Killing vectors are studied in Einstein's theory of gravity, and found that no outer apparent horizons exist, provided that the dominant energy condition holds.



We present methods for the construction of exact diagonal cylindrically symmetric solutions in a four dimensional low energy limit of string theory, the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. The methods allow us to generate exact string backgrounds from known solutions to the equations of Einstein or Einstein gravity coupled to a massless scalar field. We also give and analyze explicit examples of such solutions. It is shown that they are free of curvature singularities,(quasi)regular on the axis of symmetry, asymptotically flat and describe nonrotating cosmic strings interacting with gravitational, dilaton and electromagnetic waves.
It has often been suggested (especially by S. Carlip) that spacetime symmetries in the neighborhood of a black hole horizon may be relevant to a statistical understanding of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. A prime candidate for this type of symmetry is that one which is exhibited by the Einstein tensor. More precisely, it is now known that this tensor takes on a strongly constrained (block-diagonal) form as it approaches any stationary, non-extremal Killing horizon. Presently, exploiting the geometrical properties of such horizons, we provide a particularly elegant argument that substantiates this highly symmetric form for the Einstein tensor. It is, however, duly noted that, on account of a “loophole,” the argument does fall just short of attaining the status of a rigorous proof.
The Hamiltonian formulation of curvature squared action requires suitable choice of auxiliary variables. It has been observed here that for correct classical and quantum description, curvature squared action should be supplemented by a boundary term <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Sigma= 4\beta\int\sqrt{h}K^4Rd^3x \)</span>. Further a part of the boundary term viz. <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\sigma=4\beta\int\sqrt hK^3Rd^3x \)</span> should be eliminated prior to the introduction of the auxiliary variable. In the process auxiliary variable becomes unique and model dependent. The phase spaces corresponding to isotropic and anisotropic minisuperspace models are found to be spanned by different sets of variables. Thus there does not exist a general quantum dynamical equation like Wheeler-DeWitt one, that is valid for both isotropic and anisotropic models.
Null isotropy in a spacetime is defined. The relation of null isotropy to the constant curvature and infinitesimal spatial isotropy is investigated. The influence of null isotropy on conjugate points along null geodesics and curvature singularities is investigated.
Wave packet broadening in usual quantum mechanics is a consequence of dispersion behavior of the medium which the wave propagates in it. In this paper, we consider the problem of wave packet broadening in the framework of Generalized Uncertainty Principle(GUP) of quantum gravity. New dispersion relations are derived in the context of GUP and it has been shown that there exists a gravitational induced dispersion which leads to more broadening of the wave packets. As a result of these dispersion relations, a generalized Klein-Gordon equation is obtained and its interpretation is given.
The probability representation for quantum states of the universe in which the states are described by a fair probability distribution instead of wave function (or density matrix) is developed to consider cosmological dynamics. The evolution of the universe state is described by standard positive transition probability (tomographic transition probability) instead of the complex transition probability amplitude (Feynman path integral) of the standard approach. The latter one is expressed in terms of the tomographic transition probability. Examples of minisuperspaces in the framework of the suggested approach are presented. Possibility of observational applications of the universe tomographs are discussed.
A conformally flat accelerated charge metric is found in an arbitrary dimension <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>. It is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-null fluid equations with a cosmological constant in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> ≥ 4 dimensions. When the acceleration is zero, our solution reduces to the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson metric. We show that the charge loses its energy, for all dimensions, due to the acceleration.
Firstly, we review the pointwise and averaged energy conditions, the quantum inequality and the notion of the “volume integral quantifier,” which provides a measure of the “total amount” of energy condition violating matter. Secondly, we present a specific metric of a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole in the presence of a generic cosmological constant, verifying that the null and the averaged null energy conditions are violated, as was to be expected. Thirdly, a pressureless dust shell is constructed around the interior wormhole spacetime by matching the latter geometry to a unique vacuum exterior solution. In order to further minimize the usage of exotic matter, we then find regions where the surface energy density is positive, thereby satisfying all of the energy conditions at the junction surface. An equation governing the behavior of the radial pressure across the junction surface is also deduced. Lastly, taking advantage of the construction, specific dimensions of the wormhole, namely, the throat radius and the junction interface radius, and estimates of the total traversal time and maximum velocity of an observer journeying through the wormhole, are also found by imposing the traversability conditions.
Singularities in the dark energy universe are discussed, assuming that there is a bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid. In particular, it is shown how the physically natural assumption of letting the bulk viscosity be proportional to the scalar expansion in a spatially flat FRW universe can drive the fluid into the phantom region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &lt; −1), even if it lies in the quintessence region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &gt; −1) in the non-viscous case.
We prove, for the relativistic Boltzmann equation on a Bianchi Type I space-time, a global existence and uniqueness theorem, for arbitrarily large initial data.
Prompted by the recent more precise determination of the basic cosmological parameters and growing evidence that the matter-energy content of the universe is now dominated by dark energy and dark matter we present the general solution of the equation that describes the evolution of density perturbations in the linear approximation. It turns out that as in the standard CDM model the density perturbations grow very slowly during the radiation dominated epoch and their amplitude increases by a factor of about 4000 in the matter and later dark energy dominated epoch of expansion of the universe.
We present a first attempt to apply the approach of deformation quantization to linearized Einstein's equations. We use the analogy with Maxwell equations to derive the field equations of linearized gravity from a modified Maxwell Lagrangian which allows the construction of a Hamiltonian in the standard way. The deformation quantization procedure for free fields is applied to this Hamiltonian. As a result we obtain the complete set of quantum states and the discrete energy spectrum of linearized gravity.
In this paper, we have examined strings with monopole and electric field and domain walls with matter and electric field in the spherically symmetric space-time admitting a one-parameter group of conformal motions. For this purpose, we have solved Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric space-time via conformal motions. Also, we have discussed the features of the obtained solutions.
We investigate the effects of a weak gravitational wave, modelled as a gaussian wavepacket, on the polarization state of an electromagnetic field enclosed in a cavity. Our approach is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">semiclassical</em>, in that the electromagnetic field is described as a quantum field, while the gravitational perturbation is treated classically, as a slightly curved background spacetime. Assuming that before the interaction the electromagnetic field has been prepared in a given polarization state, we show that – due to the gravitational scattering with the wave – some photons having different polarization states are found in the cavity at late times. Such polarization scattering has some resemblance with Thomson scattering, well-known in Quantum Electrodynamics: hence the motivation for the title. We give a numerical estimate of the resulting photon polarization spreading in the case of a typical gravitational burst from a final supernova rebound. We also briefly comment about the possible influence of such gravitational scattering on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization.
We derive and analyze a class of spherically symmetric cosmological models whose source is an interactive mixture of inhomogeneous cold dark matter (DM) and a generic homogeneous dark energy (DE) fluid. If the DE fluid corresponds to a quintessence scalar field, the interaction term can be associated with a well motivated non-minimal coupling to the DM component. By constructing a suitable volume average of the DM component we obtain a Friedman evolution equation relating this average density with an average Hubble scalar, with the DE component playing the role of a repulsive and time-dependent Λ term. Once we select an “equation of state” linking the energy density (μ) and pressure (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>) of the DE fluid, as well as a free function governing the radial dependence, the models become fully determinate and can be applied to known specific DE sources, such as quintessence scalar fields or tachyonic fluids. Considering the simple equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (γ − 1) μ with 0 ≤ γ &lt; 2/3, we show that the free parameters and boundary conditions can be selected for an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a suitable cosmic background that accurately fits current observational data. While a DE dominated scenario emerges in the asymptotic future, with total Ω and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> tending respectively to 1 and −1/2 for all cosmic observers, the effects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy yield different local behavior and evolution rates for these parameters in the local overdense region. We suggest that the models presented can be directly applied to explore the effects of various DE formalisms on local DM cosmological inhomogeneities.
We show that the method used in the Schwarzschild black hole for finding the elementary solution of the electrostatic equation in closed form cannot extend in higher dimensions. By contrast, we prove the existence of static, spherically symmetric geometries with a non-degenerate horizon in which the static scalar equation can be solved in closed form. We give the explicit results in 6 dimensions. We determine moreover the expressions of the electrostatic potential and of the static scalar field for a point source in the extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes in higher dimensions.
Self-similar models are important in general relativity and other fundamental theories. In this paper we shall discuss the “similarity hypothesis”, which asserts that under a variety of physical circumstances solutions of these theories will naturally evolve to a self-similar form. We will find there is good evidence for this in the context of both spatially homogenous and inhomogeneous cosmological models, although in some cases the self-similar model is only an intermediate attractor. There are also a wide variety of situations, including critical phenomena, in which spherically symmetric models tend towards self-similarity. However, this does not happen in all cases and it is important to understand the prerequisites for the conjecture.
It is shown that among the four classes of the static spherically symmetric solutions of the vacuum Brans-Dicke theory of gravity only two are really independent. Further, by matching exterior and interior (due to physically reasonable spherically symmetric matter source) scalar fields it is found that only the Brans class I solution with a certain restriction on the solution parameters may represent an exterior metric for a nonsingular massive object. The physical viability of the black hole nature of the solution is investigated. It is concluded that no physical black hole solution different from the Schwarzschild black hole is available in the Brans-Dicke theory.
A system of coupled point masses under the influence of gravitational waves is considered. By means of the geodesic deviation equation as the equation of motion it is shown, taking into account the second order small terms, that there exist forces which cause the acceleration of the system in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal force is due to the fact that simultaneously with energy momentum is also absorbed from waves. It is proved directly on the basis of the equations of motion of the point masses that the energy and momentum absorbed by the test system obey the special relativistic relationship of a zero rest mass particle. The case when the Weber oscillator moves at a relativistic speed with respect to the source of gravitational waves is also examined. In this case, the absorption of energy and momentum by the Weber oscillator is much larger or smaller compared to the stationary situation.
The answer to the question, what physical meaning should be attributed to the so-called boost-rotation symmetric exact solutions to the field equations of general relativity, is provided within the general interpretation scheme for the “theories of relativity,” based on group theoretical arguments, and set forth by Erich Kretschmann already in the year 1917.
By inspecting some known solutions to Einstein's equations, we present the metric of higher dimensional Reissner-Nordström black hole in the background of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe. Then we verify the solution with a perfect fluid. The discussion of the event horizon of the black hole reveals that the scale of the black hole would increase with the expansion of the universe and decrease with the contraction of the universe.
The debate on the physical relevance of conformal transformations can be faced by taking the Palatini approach into account gravitational theories. We show that conformal transformations are not only a mathematical tool to disentangle gravitational and matter degrees of freedom (passing from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame) but they acquire a physical meaning considering the bi-metric structure of Palatini approach which allows to distinguish between spacetime structure and geodesic structure. These facts are relevant at least at cosmological scales, while at small scale (i.e. in the spacetime regions relevant for observations) the conformal factor is slowly varying and its effects are not relevant. Examples of higher-order and non-minimally coupled theories are worked out and relevant cosmological solutions in Einstein frame and Jordan frame are discussed showing that also the interpretation of cosmological observations can drastically change depending on the adopted frame.
Braneworld theory provides a natural setting to treat, at a classical level, the cosmological effects of vacuum energy. Non-static extra dimensions can generally lead to a variable vacuum energy, which in turn may explain the present accelerated cosmic expansion. We concentrate our attention in models where the vacuum energy decreases as an inverse power law of the scale factor. These models agree with the observed accelerating universe, while fitting simultaneously the observational data for the density and deceleration parameter. The redshift at which the vacuum energy can start to dominate depends on the mass density of ordinary matter. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\bar \Omega\)</span> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> = 0.3, the transition from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion occurs at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> </sub>≈ 0.48 ± 0.20, which is compatible with SNe data. We set a lower bound on the deceleration parameter today, namely <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\bar{q}\)</span> &gt; − 1 + 3 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\bar \Omega\)</span> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub>/2, i.e., <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\bar{q}\)</span> &gt; − 0.55 for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\bar \Omega \)</span> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> = 0.3. The future evolution of the universe crucially depends on the time when vacuum starts to dominate over ordinary matter. If it dominates only recently, at an epoch <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> &lt; 0.64, then the universe is accelerating today and will continue that way forever. If vacuum dominates earlier, at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> &gt; 0.64, then the deceleration comes back and the universe recollapses at some point in the distant future. In the first case, quintessence and Cardassian expansion can be formally interpreted as the low energy limit of our model, although they are entirely different in philosophy. In the second case there is no correspondence between these models and ours.
This work develops the dynamics of a perfectly elastic solid model for application to the outer crust of a magnetised neutron star. Particular attention is given to the Noether identities responsible for energy-momentum conservation, using a formulation that is fully covariant, not only (as is usual) in a fully relativistic treatment but also (sacrificing accuracy and elegance for economy of degrees of gravitational freedom) in the technically more complicated case of the Newtonian limit. The results are used to obtain explicit (relativistic and Newtonian) formulae for the propagation speeds of generalised (Alfven type) magneto-elastic perturbation modes.
We study the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with dynamical dark energy modelled in terms of the equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> </sub> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>)) ρ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> </sub> in which the coefficient <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em> </sub> is parameterized by the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> or redshift <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>. We use methods of qualitative analysis of differential equations to investigate the space of all admissible solutions for all initial conditions on the two-dimensional phase plane. We show advantages of representing this dynamics as a motion of a particle in the one-dimensional potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>). One of the features of this reduction is the possibility of investigating how typical big rip singularities are in the future evolution of the model. The properties of potential function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> can serve as a tool for qualitative classification of all evolution paths. Some important features like resolution of the acceleration problem can be simply visualized as domains on the phase plane. Then one is able to see how large is the class of solutions (labelled by the inset of the initial conditions) leading to the desired property.
We study the qualitative dynamical behaviour of a phantom field minimally coupled to gravity, with an arbitrary self-interacting potential. We show that the dynamics of this system is surprisingly simple, independently of the form of the potential. Periodic or oscillatory behaviour of the scale factor or periodic behaviour of the scalar field is not possible. We characterize all the possible asymptotic behaviours of the dynamical variables.
A nontrivial scalar field configuration of vanishing energy-momentum is reported. These matter configurations have no influence on the metric and therefore they are not be “detected" gravitationally. This phenomenon occurs for a time–dependent nonminimally coupled and self-interacting scalar field on the 2+1 (BTZ) black hole geometry. We conclude that such stealth configurations exist for the static 2+1 black hole for any value of the nonminimal coupling parameter ζ≠0 with a fixed self-interaction potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> <sub>ζ</sub>(Φ). For the range 0 &lt; ζ≤1/2 potentials are bounded from below and for the range 0 &lt; ζ &lt; 1/4 the stealth field falls into the black hole and is swallowed by it at an exponential rate, without any consequence for the black hole.
It is pointed out that scalar-tensor theories of gravity admit solutions in which the metric is Minkowskian although the scalar and matter fields do not vanish. Explicit pp-wave solutions of the Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory are presented. These include solutions with metrics that are flat or Ricci flat even though the Maxwell and scalar fields are non-zero.
The determination of the fine structure constant α and the search for its possible variation are considered. We focus on the role of the fine structure constant in modern physics and discuss precision tests of quantum electrodynamics.Different methods of a search for possible variations of fundamental constants are compared and those related to optical measurements are considered in detail.

This is the first of a couple of papers in which the peculiar capabilities of the Hamiltonian approach to general relativity are exploited to get both <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new</em> results concerning specific technical issues, and new insights about <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">old</em> foundational problems of the theory. The first paper includes: (1) a critical analysis of the various concepts of symmetry related to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian viewpoint on the one hand, and to the Hamiltonian viewpoint, on the other. This analysis leads, in particular, to a re-interpretation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">active</em> diffeomorphisms as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">passive and metric-dependent</em> dynamical symmetries of Einstein's equations, a re-interpretation which enables to disclose the (not widely known)) connection of a subgroup of them to Hamiltonian gauge transformations <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">on-shell</em>; (2) a re-visitation of the canonical reduction of the ADM formulation of general relativity, with particular emphasis on the geometro-dynamical effects of the gauge-fixing procedure, which amounts to the definition of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">global non-inertial, space-time laboratory</em>. This analysis discloses the peculiar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dynamical nature</em> that the traditional definition of distant simultaneity and clock-synchronization assume in general relativity, as well as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gauge relatedness</em> of the “conventions” which generalize the classical Einstein's convention. (3) a clarification of the physical role of Dirac and gauge variables, as their being related to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tidal-like</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">generalized inertial effects</em>, respectively. This clarification is mainly due to the fact that, unlike the standard formulations of the equivalence principle, the Hamiltonian formalism allows to define a generalized notion of “force” in general relativity in a natural way.
This is the second of a couple of papers in which we aim to show the peculiar capability of the Hamiltonian ADM formulation of metric gravity to grasp a series of conceptual and technical problems that appear to have not been directly discussed so far. In this paper we also propose new viewpoints about issues that, being deeply rooted into the foundational level of Einstein theory, seem particularly worth of clarification in connection with the alternative programs of string theory and loop quantum gravity. The achievements of the present work include: (1) the analysis of the so-called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hole</em> phenomenology in strict connection with the Hamiltonian treatment of the initial value problem. The work is carried through in metric gravity for the class of spatially non-compact Christoudoulou-Klainermann space-times, in which the temporal evolution is ruled by the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">weak</em> ADM energy. It is crucial to our analysis the re-interpretation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">active</em> diffeomorphisms as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">passive and metric-dependent</em> dynamical symmetries of Einstein's equations, a re-interpretation which enables to disclose their (nearly unknown) connection to gauge transformations on-shell; this is expounded in the first paper (gr-qc/0403081); (2) the utilization of the Bergmann-Komar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic pseudo-coordinates</em>, defined as suitable functionals of the Weyl curvature scalars, as tools for a specific gauge-fixing to the super-hamiltonian and super-momentum constraints; (3) the consequent construction of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">physical atlas</em> of 4-coordinate systems for the 4-dimensional <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mathematical</em> manifold, in terms of the highly non-local degrees of freedom of the gravitational field (its four independent <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Dirac observables</em>). Such construction embodies the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">physical individuation</em> of the points of space-time as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">point-events</em>, both in absence and presence of matter, and associates a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-commutative structure</em> to each gauge fixing or 4-dimensional coordinate system; (4) a clarification of the multiple definition given by Peter Bergmann of the concept of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(Bergmann) observable</em> in general relativity. This clarification leads to the proposal of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">main conjecture</em> asserting the existence of: i) special Dirac's observables which are also Bergmann's observables, ii) gauge variables that are coordinate independent (namely they behave like the tetradic scalar fields of the Newman-Penrose formalism). A by-product of this achievements is the falsification of a recently advanced argument asserting the absence of (any kind of) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">change</em> in the observable quantities of general relativity; (5) a proposal showing how the physical individuation of point-events could in principle be implemented as an experimental setup and protocol leading to a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">standard of space-time</em> more or less like atomic clocks define standards of time.</p><p class="Para">In the end, against the well-known Einstein's assertion according to which <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">general covariance takes away from space and time the last remnant of physical objectivity</em>, we conclude that point-events maintain a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">peculiar sort of objectivity</em>. Also, besides being operationally essential for building measuring apparatuses for the gravitational field, the role of matter in the non-vacuum gravitational case is also that of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">participating directly</em> in the individuation process, being involved in the determination of the Dirac observables. Finally, some hints following from our approach for the quantum gravity programme are suggested.
We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a conformally invariant gravitational theory. We particularly emphasize on the nonminimal coupling of matter fields to gravity. By the nonminimal coupling we consider a local distinction between the conformal frames of metric of matter fieldsand the metric explicitly entering the vacuum sector. We suppose that these two frames are conformally related by a dilaton field. We show that the imposition of a condition on the variable mass term of a scalar field may lead to the spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this way the scalar field may imitate the Higgs field behavior. Attributing a constant configuration to the ground state of the Higgs field, a Higgs conformal frame is specified. We define the Higgs conformal frame as a cosmological frame which describes the large scale characteristics of the observed universe. In the cosmological frame the gravitational coupling acquires a correct value and one no longer deals with the vacuum energy problem. We then study a more general case by considering a variable configuration for the ground state of Higgs field. In this case we introduce a cosmological solution of themodel.
It is shown that a string fluid is the simplest anisotropic fluid with vanishing heat flux. Furthermore it has the property that the Ricci tensor is obtained from the energy momentum tensor, and vice versa, if one interchanges the fluid variables. We use previous works on the collineations of anisotropic fluids, which include the string fluid as a particular case, to compute the kinematic and the dynamic effects of certain collineations of a string fluid. It is found that the possible spacetimes, which can carry a string fluid, are severely restricted and the possible string fluids in spacetimes, which can admit them are more or less fixed. We recover previous results on the effect of symmetries in string fluid spacetimes and get many new ones, for example the matter inheritance collineations. The study and the results are presented in a systematic manner, which allows the comprehension and the comparison of the restrictions imposed by each collineation. Finally one can use the same method of work for a systematic study of similar problems.
The magnitude-redshift test is applied to cosmological models in extended theories of gravity containing extra terms in the Lagrangian which give rise to an evolving dark-energy component. Two classes of models are considered: one based on generalized scalar-tensor theory and the other on curvature corrections to the metric tensor. Results are compared to recent observational data of Type Ia supernovae. The predictions of both kinds of models may provide better fits to the data depending on dimensionless free parameters of order ∼ 0.01−0.1.
As a consequence of gravitational induced uncertainty, equation of motion for harmonic oscillator differs considerably from usual quantum mechanical situation. This paper considers the dynamics of a simple harmonic oscillator in the context of Generalized (Gravitational) Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Using Heisenberg Picture of quantum mechanics, we find time evolution of position and momentum operators and we will show that expectation values have an unusual complicated mass dependence. Also we will show that since the notion of locality breaks down, Ehrenfest theorem is not satisfied for harmonic oscillator in GUP.
In this work we investigate the behavior of three-dimensional (3D) cosmological models. The simulation of inflationary and dark-energy-dominated eras are among the possible results in these 3D formulations; taking as starting point the results obtained by Cornish and Frankel. Motivated by those results, we investigate, first, the inflationary case where we consider a two-constituent cosmological fluid: the scalar field represents the hypothetical inflaton which is in gravitational interaction with a matter/radiation contribution. For the description of an old universe, it is possible to simulate its evolution starting with a matter dominated universe that faces a decelerated/accelerated transition due to the presence of the additional constituent (simulated by the scalar field or ruled by an exotic equation of state) that plays the role of dark energy. We obtain, through numerical analysis, the evolution in time of the scale factor, the acceleration, the energy densities, and the hydrostatic pressure of the constituents. The alternative scalar cosmology proposed by Cornish and Frankel is also under investigation in this work. In this case an inflationary model can be constructed when another non-polytropic equation of state (the van der Waals equation) is used to simulate the behavior of an early 3D universe.

It is shown that, on a manifold with a Finsler metric of Lorentzian signature, the lightlike geodesics satisfy the following variational principle. Among all lightlike curves from a point <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> (emission event) to a timelike curve γ (worldline of receiver), the lightlike geodesics make the arrival time stationary. Here “arrival time” refers to a parametrization of the timelike curve γ. This variational principle can be applied (i) to the vacuum light rays in an alternative spacetime theory, based on Finsler geometry, and (ii) to light rays in an anisotropic non-dispersive medium with a general-relativistic spacetime as background.
In the Kaluza-Klein model with a cosmological constant Λ and a flux, the external spacetime of the created universe from a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sup> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sup>seed instanton can be identified in quantum cosmology. One can also show that in the internal space theeffective cosmological constant is most probably zero.
In this paper, we extend Parikh's recent work to two kinds of the black holes whose ADM mass is no longer identical to its mass parameter, each with a topological defect, one being a global monopole black hole and another a cosmic string black hole. We view Hawking radiation as a tunnelling process across the event horizon and calculate the tunnelling probability. From the tunnelling probability we also find a leading correction to the semiclassical emission rate. The results are consistent with an underlying unitary theory.


In relativistic theory of irreversible thermodynamical processes near equilibrium, generally a series of assumptions is made having, in particular, the consequence that the temperature vector is a Killing vector. We show that, in contrast to usual approaches, in equilibrium (i) the temperature vector can also be a conformal Killing vector, (ii) as an implication of the Killing property of the temperature vector, most assumptions made can be derived, without restricting the matter configuration to a perfect fluid, (iii) for non-vanishing rotation of the fluid, the heat-flow is unequal to zero, (iv) for vanishing acceleration of the fluid the Friedmann radiation cosmos is the only physically significant solution of Einstein's equations and (v) the equilibrium conditions are of the Cattaneo form such that a causal propagation of temperature can be expected.
We obtain the energy and momentum densities of a general static axially symmetric vacuum space-time, the Weyl metric, with the help of Landau – Lifshitz and Bergmann – Thomson energy-momentum complexes. We find that these two definitions of energy-momentum complexes do not provide the same energy density for the space-time under consideration, while give the same momentum density. We show that, in the case of the Curzon metric (a particular case of the Weyl metric), these two definitions give the same energy only when R → ∞. Furthermore, we compare these results with those obtained using Einstein, Papapetrou and MØller energy momentum complexes.
We take a boundary-value approach to quantum amplitudes arising in gravitational collapse to a black hole. Pose boundary data on initial and final space-like hypersurfaces Σ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>,<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> </sub>, separated at spatial infinity by a Lorentzian proper-time interval <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>. Quantum amplitudes are calculated following Feynman's approach; rotate: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>→|<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>|exp (−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em>θ) into the complex, where 0&lt; θ≤π/2, and solve the corresponding well-posed complex <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classical</em> boundary-value problem. We compute the classical Lorentzian action <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub>class</sub> and corresponding semi-classical quantum amplitude, proportional to exp (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">iS</em> <sub>class</sub>). To recover the Lorentzian amplitude, take the limit θ→ 0<sub>+</sub> of the semi-classical amplitude. For the classical boundary-value problem with given perturbative boundary data, we compute an effective spherically-symmetric energy-momentum tensor 〉 <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sup>μν</sup>〈<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">EFF</em> </sub>, averaged over several wavelengths of the radiation, describing the averaged extra energy-momentum contribution in the Einstein field equations, due to the perturbations. This takes the form of a null fluid, describing the radiation (of quantum origin) streaming radially outwards. The classical space-time metric, in this region of the space time, is of Vaidya form, justifying the adiabatic radial mode equations, for spins <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> = 0 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> = 2.
We algebraically classify some higher dimensional spacetimes, including a number of vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations which can represent higher dimensional black holes.We discuss some consequences of this work.
With the aim of understanding the cosmic velocity fields at large scale, we investigate the dynamics of a pressureless distribution of gravitational sources moving under an anisotropic generalization of Hubble expansion and according to Euler-Poisson equations system. As a result, it turns out that such a behavior requires the distribution to be homogenous, similarly to Hubble law. Among several solutions, we show a planar kinematics which admits a constant (eternal) and rotational distortion, where the velocity field is not potential. Within this class, the one with no rotational distortion identifies to a bulk flow. To apply this model within cosmic structures as the Local Super Cluster, the solutions are interpreted as approximations providing us with an hint on the behavior of the cosmic flow just after decoupling era up to present date. Such a result suggests that the observed bulk flow may not be due exclusively to tidal forces but has a primordial origin.
We find a class of warp drive spacetimes possessing Newtonian limits, which we then determine. The same method is used to compute Newtonian limits of the Schwarzschild solution and spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models.
We consider the topology of the BS causal completion, and show that it is not distorted in the causal direction. Using this result, we show that the causal completion with spacelike causal boundary in the sense of the BS construction satisfies the formal definition of the global hyperbolicity. We also show that any two causally related points in the causal completion can be connected by a causal geodesic.
The possibility that the present acceleration of the Universe is driven by a kind of viscous fluid is exploited. At background level this model is similar to the generalized Chaplygin gas model (GCGM). But, at the perturbative level, the viscous fluid exhibits interesting properties. In particular the oscillations in the power spectrum that plagues the GCGM are not present. Possible fundamental descriptions for this viscous dark energy are discussed.

By establishing that Palatini formulation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity is equivalent to ω=−3/2 Brans-Dicke theory, we show that energy-momentum tensor is covariantly conserved in this type of modified gravity theory.

We comment on the paper “ISLAND – Inverse-Square-Law Acceleration Measurement using Inertial Drift,” by Lockerbie, N.A.: Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">36</strong>, 593–600 (2004).
This paper is in answer to the comment on the GRG paper: Lockerbie N.A. Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">36</strong>, 593 (2004), made by A.V. Sanders, G.T. Gillies (ibid.).



The analysis of the modifications that the presence of a deformed dispersion relation entails in the roots of the so-called degree of coherence function, for a beam embodying two different frequencies and moving in a Michelson interferometer, is carried out. The conditions to be satisfied, in order to detect this kind of quantum gravity effect, are also obtained.
We study noncommutative quantum and classical cosmology with a scalar field by means of deforming the minisuperspace. We analyze the homogeneous and isotropic model and compare our results with the usual commutative case. In particular the classical behaviour of the scalar field can dramatically change due to the presence of noncommutativity.
The standard methods for quantizing relativistic strings diverge significantly from the Dirac-Wheeler-DeWitt program for quantization of generally covariant systems and one wonders whether the latter could be successfully implemented as an alternative to the former. As a first step in this direction, we consider the possibility of quantizing strings (and also relativistic membranes) via a partially gauge-fixed ADM (Arnowitt, Deser and Misner) formulation of the reduced field equations for these systems. By exploiting some (Euclidean signature) Hamilton-Jacobi techniques that Mike Ryan and I had developed previously for the quantization of Bianchi IX cosmological models, I show how to construct Diff(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>1</sup>)-invariant (or Diff(Σ)-invariant in the case of membranes) ground state wave functionals for the cases of co-dimension one strings and membranes embedded in Minkowski spacetime. I also show that the reduced Hamiltonian density operators for these systems weakly commute when applied to physical (i.e. Diff(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>1</sup>) or Diff(Σ)-invariant) states. While many open questions remain, these preliminary results seem to encourage further research along the same lines.
A brief overview on the subject of Supersymmetric Quantum Cosmology (SQC) is presented here. Different approaches are described, all of them being inspired by the search of a square root of (quantum) General Relativity. Some new ideas in the form of a list of (still!) open problems and an extensive bibliography are included.
We reconsider the unified model of gravitation and Yang–Mills interactions proposed by Chakraborty and Peldán, in the light of recent formal developments in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we show that one can promote the Hamiltonian constraint of the unified model to a well defined anomaly-free quantum operator using the techniques introduced by Thiemann, at least for the Euclidean theory. The Lorentzian version of the model can be consistently constructed, but at the moment appears to yield a correct weak field theory only under restrictive assumptions, and its quantization appears problematic.
We present a parametrization of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sup>3</sup> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>1</sup> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> Gowdy cosmological models which allows us to study both types of topologies simultaneously. We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the general solution of the linear polarized special case (with both topologies) has exactly the same functional dependence. This unified parametrization is used to investigate the existence of Cauchy horizons at the cosmological singularities, leading to a violation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture. Our results indicate that the only acausal spacetimes are described by the Kantowski-Sachs and the Kerr-Gowdy metrics.
We consider the quantum mechanical equivalence of the Seiberg-Witten map in the context of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal phase-space formalism in order to construct a quantum mechanics over noncommutative Heisenberg algebras. The formalism is then applied to the exactly soluble Landau and harmonic oscillator problems in the 2-dimensional noncommutative phase-space plane, in order to derive their correct energy spectra and corresponding Wigner distributions. We compare our results with others that have previously appeared in the literature.
The indefinite sign of the Hamiltonian constraint means that solutions to Einstein's equations must achieve a delicate balance – often among numerically large terms that nearly cancel. If numerical errors cause a violation of the Hamiltonian constraint, the failure of the delicate balance could lead to qualitatively wrong behavior rather than just decreased accuracy. This issue is different from instabilities caused by constraint-violating modes. Examples of stable numerical simulations of collapsing cosmological spacetimes exhibiting local mixmaster dynamics with and without Hamiltonian constraint enforcement are presented.
Oscillatons are spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein–Klein–Gordon equations. These solutions are non-singular, asymptotically flat, and with periodic time dependency. In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of particles moving around of an oscillatonic field. Bound orbits are found for particular values of the particles' angular momentum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> and their initial radial position <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub>0</sub>. It is found that the radial coordinate of such particles oscillates in time and we are able to predict the corresponding oscillating period as well as its amplitude. We carry out this study for the quadratic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>(φ) = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> <sub>Φ</sub> Φ<sup>2</sup>/2 scalar field potential. We discuss possible ways to follow in order to connect this kind of studies with astrophysical observations.
Using only the principle of relativity and Euclidean geometry we show in this pedagogical article that the square of proper time or length in a two-dimensional spacetime diagram is proportional to the Euclidean area of the corresponding causal domain. We use this relation to derive the Minkowski line element by two geometric proofs of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">spacetime Pythagoras theorem</em>.
In four spacetime dimensions gravitational plane waves (a special case of the plane-fronted waves with parallel rays) admit a 5 parameter isometry group. We generalize this group to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensions and explore some special features of spacetimes admitting this isometry group. In particular, it is shown that every generally covariant rank-2 symmetric tensor field constructed from a metric with plane wave symmetry will vanish except multiples of the metric and Ricci tensors. We show that, in four spacetime dimensions, a particular enlargement of the plane wave symmetry group is enough to force the group-invariant metrics to satisfy all generally covariant vacuum equations. We comment on the construction of a “mini-superspace” description of spacetimes admitting plane wave symmetry.
Gauged WZW and coset models are known to be useful to prove holomorphic factorization of the partition function of WZW and coset models. In this note we show that these gauged models can be also important to quantize the theory in the context of the Berezin formalism. For gauged coset models Berezin quantization procedure also admits a further holomorphic factorization in the complex structure of the moduli space.
Within the Geometrical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics, quantum states are <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rays</em> in the standard Hilbert space of the theory. The resulting formulation is very elegant from the geometrical viewpoint, since it allows to cast the main postulates of the theory in terms of two geometric structures, namely a symplectic structure and a Riemannian metric. However, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics is not naturally incorporated, since the quantum state space is non-linear. In this note we offer some steps to incorporate the superposition principle within the geometric description. In this respect, we argue that it is necessary to make the distinction between a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">projective superposition principle</em> and a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">decomposition principle</em> that should replace the standard superposition principle. We illustrate our proposal with two very well known examples, namely the spin 1/2 system and the two slit experiment, where the distinction is clear.
We consider the Frenet-Serret geometry of null curves in a three and a four-dimensional Minkowski background. We develop a theory of deformations adapted to the Frenet-Serret frame. We exploit it to provide a Lagrangian description of the dynamics of geometric models for null curves.


Both for the background world model and its linear perturbations Newtonian cosmology coincides with the zero-pressure limits of relativistic cosmology. However, such successes in Newtonian cosmology are not purely based on Newton's gravity, but are rather guided ones by previously known results in Einstein's theory. The action-at-a-distance nature of Newton's gravity requires further verification from Einstein's theory for its use in the large-scale nonlinear regimes. We study the domain of validity of the Newtonian cosmology by investigating weakly nonlinear regimes in relativistic cosmology assuming a zero-pressure and irrotational fluid. We show that, first, if we ignore the coupling with gravitational waves the Newtonian cosmology is exactly valid even to the second order in perturbation. Second, the pure relativistic correction terms start appearing from the third order. Third, the correction terms are independent of the horizon scale and are quite small in the large-scale near the horizon. These conclusions are based on our special (and proper) choice of variables and gauge conditions. In a complementary situation where the system is weakly relativistic but fully nonlinear (thus, far inside the horizon) we can employ the post-Newtonian approximation. We also show that in the large-scale structures the post-Newtonian effects are quite small. As a consequence, now we can rely on the Newtonian gravity in analyzing the evolution of nonlinear large-scale structures even near the horizon volume.
We investigate the viability of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories in the framework of the Palatini approach as solutions to the problem of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Two physically motivated popular choices for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) are considered,: power law, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) = β <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup>, and logarithmic, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) = α ln <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. Under the Palatini approach, both Lagrangians give rise to cosmological models comprising only standard matter and undergoing a present phase of accelerated expansion. We use the Hubble diagram of type Ia Supernovae and the data on the gas mass fraction in relaxed galaxy clusters to see whether these models are able to reproduce what is observed and to constrain their parameters. It turns out that they are indeed able to fit the data with values of the Hubble constant and of the matter density parameter in agreement with some model independent estimates, but the today deceleration parameter is higher than what is measured in the concordance ΛCDM model.
String theory, quantum geometry, loop quantum gravity and black hole physics all indicate the existence of a minimal observable length on the order of Planck length. This feature leads to a modification of Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Such a modified Heisenberg uncertainty principle is referred as gravitational uncertainty principle(GUP) in literatures. This proposal has some novel implications on various domains of theoretical physics. Here, we study some consequences of GUP in the spirit of Quantum mechanics. We consider two problem: a particle in an one-dimensional box and free particle wave function. In each case we will solve corresponding perturbational equations and compare the results with ordinary solutions.
The quantum theory of angular momentum affords a treatment of tensors and vectors in a spherical basis. By using this theory we define the tensor differential operators: divergence, curl and gradient which act on a tensor of any rank, in terms of C-G coefficients. With these definitions we obtain a matrix representation and useful properties for those operators. An interesting application of this formalism is to find the wave equation of a tensor of any rank in a linear theory. This provides a new common way to look at the wave equations associated with both Maxwell's equations and the Maxwell-like equations for the linearized Weyl curvature tensor in gravitoelectromagnetism describing gravitational radiation on a Minkowski spacetime background.
In this paper it is shown that the Brans – Dicke scalar field itself can serve the purpose of providing an early deceleration and a late time acceleration of the universe without any need of quintessence field if one considers an interaction, i.e., transfer of energy between the dark matter and the Brans – Dicke scalar field.
In this paper we proposed to use the group of analysis of symmetries of the dynamical system to describe the evolution of the Universe. This method is used in searching for the unknown equation of state. It is shown that group of symmetries enforce the form of the equation of state for noninteracting scaling multifluids. We showed that symmetries give rise to the equation of state in the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> =-Λ + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>1</sub>ρ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>) + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>2</sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>β</sup> + 0 and energy density ρ = Λ+ρ<sub>01</sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>-3(1+w)</sup> +ρ<sub>02</sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>α</sup> +ρ<sub>03</sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>-3</sup>, which is commonly used in cosmology. The FRW model filled with scaling fluid (called homological) is confronted with the observations of distant type Ia supernovae. We found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysis of SNIa data.We showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well to supernovae data. We found that Ω<sub>m,0</sub> ≃ 0.4 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> ≃ -1 (β = -3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to a high density universe. However if we assume prior that Ω<sub>m,0</sub> = 0.3 then the favoured model is close to concordance ΛCDM model. Our results predict that in the considered model with scaling fluids distant type Ia supernovae should be brighter than in the ΛCDM model, while intermediate distant SNIa should be fainter than in the ΛCDM model. We also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid is actually preferred by data over ΛCDM model. As a result we find from the Akaike model selection criterion: it prefers the model with noninteracting scaling fluid.
We investigate general relativistic effects associated with the gravitomagnetic monopole moment of a gravitational source through the analysis of the motion of test particles and electromagnetic fields distribution in the spacetime around the nonrotating cylindrical NUT source. We consider the circular motion of test particles in the NUT spacetime, their characteristics and the dependence of the effective potential on the radial coordinate for the different values of the NUT parameter and orbital momentum of test particles. It is shown that the bounds of stability for circular orbits are displaced toward the event horizon with the growth of the monopole moment of the NUT object. In addition, we obtain exact analytical solutions of the Maxwell equations for magnetized and charged cylindrical NUT stars.
The general scheme for massive spin 1 equation in curved space-time is specialized to describe the Proca fields. The expressions of the Proca tensor fields are detailed in the Robertson-Walker space-time by means of the solutions of the spin 1 equation in a given tetrad and by the components of the tetrad itself. Asymptotic behaviours of the fields are discussed in the flat, closed and open space-time cases.
A new method to obtain thick domain wall solutions to the coupled Einstein scalar field system is presented. The procedure allows the construction of irregular walls from well known ones, such that the spacetime associated to them are physically different. As consequence of the approach, we obtain two irregular geometries corresponding to thick domain walls with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dS</em> expansion and topological double kink embedded in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> spacetime. In particular, the double brane can be derived from a fake superpotential.
In this work the evolution of a Universe model is investigated where a scalar field, non-minimally coupled to space-time curvature, plays the role of quintessence and drives the Universe to a present accelerated expansion. A non-relativistic dark matter constituent that interacts directly with dark energy is also considered, where the dark matter particle mass is assumed to be proportional to the value of the scalar field. Two models for dark matter pressure are considered: the usual one, pressureless, and another that comes from a thermodynamic theory and relates the pressure with the coupling between the scalar field and the curvature scalar. Although the model has a strong dependence on the initial conditions, it is shown that the mixture consisted of dark components plus baryonic matter and radiation can reproduce the expected red-shift behavior of the deceleration parameter, density parameters and luminosity distance.
A new approximate solution of vacuum and stationary Einstein field equations is obtained. This solution is constructed by means of a power series expansion of the Ernst potential in terms of two independent and dimensionless parameters representing the quadrupole and the angular momentum respectively. The main feature of the solution is a suitable description of small deviations from spherical symmetry through perturbations of the static configuration and the massive multipole structure by using those parameters. This quality of the solution might eventually provide relevant differences with respect to the description provided by the Kerr solution.
The first-order correction of the perturbative solution of the coupled equations of the quadratic gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics is constructed, with the zeroth-order solution coinciding with the ones given by Ayón-Beato and Garcí a and by Bronnikov. It is shown that a simple generalization of the Bronnikov's electromagnetic Lagrangian leads to the solution expressible in terms of the polylogarithm functions. The solution is parametrized by two integration constants and depends on two free parameters. By the boundary conditions the integration constants are related to the charge and total mass of the system as seen by a distant observer, whereas the free parameters are adjusted to make the resultant line element regular at the center. It is argued that various curvature invariants are also regular there that strongly suggests the regularity of the spacetime. Despite the complexity of the problem the obtained solution can be studied analytically. The location of the event horizon of the black hole, its asymptotics and temperature are calculated. Special emphasis is put on the extremal configuration.
We assume a flat brane located at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> = 0, surrounded by an AdS space, and consider the 5D Einstein equations when the energy flux component of the energy-momentum tensor is related to the Hubble parameter through a constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>. We calculate the metric tensor, as well as the Hubble parameter on the brane, when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> is small. As a special case, if the brane is tensionless, the influence from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> on the Hubble parameter is absent. We also consider the emission of gravitons from the brane, by means of the Boltzmann equation. Comparing the energy conservation equation derived herefrom with the energy conservation equation for a viscous fluid on the brane, we find that the entropy change for the fluid in the emission process has to be negative. This peculiar effect is related to the fluid on the brane being a non-closed thermodynamic system. The negative entropy property for non-closed systems is encountered in other areas in physics also, in particular, in connection with the Casimir effect at finite temperature.
The relativistic kinetic theory of the phonon gas in superfluids is developed. The technique of the derivation of macroscopic balance equations from microscopic equations of motion for individual particles is applied to an ensemble of quasi-particles. The necessary expressions are constructed in terms of a Hamilton function of a (quasi-)particle. A phonon contribution into superfluid dynamic parameters is obtained from energy-momentum balance equations for the phonon gas together with the conservation law for superfluids as a whole. Relations between dynamic flows being in agreement with results of relativistic hydrodynamic consideration are found. Based on the kinetic approach a problem of relativistic variation of the speed of sound under phonon influence at low temperature is solved.
Using exact solutions, we show that it is in principle possible to regard waves and particles as representations of the same underlying geometry, thereby resolving the problem of wave-particle duality.
We present a new type of gravitational mass defect in which an infinite amount of matter may be bounded in a zero ADM mass. This interpolates between effects typical of closed worlds and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>-spheres. We consider the Tolman model of dust distribution and show that this phenomenon reveals itself for a solution that has no origin on one side but is closed on the other side. The second class of examples corresponds to smooth gluing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>-spheres to the portion of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution. The procedure is generalized to combinations of smoothly connected <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>-spheres, FRW and Schwarzschild metrics. In particular, in this approach a finite <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>-sphere is obtained that looks for observers in two <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>-regions as the Schwarzschild metric with two different masses one of which may vanish.
The false vacuum decay in a brane world model is studied in this work. We investigate the vacuum decay via the Coleman-de Luccia instanton, derive explicit approximative expressions for the Coleman-de Luccia instanton which is close to a Hawking-Moss instanton and compare the results with those already obtained within Einstein's theory of relativity.
Treating macro-black hole as quantum states, and using Brown–York's quasi-local gravitational energy definition and Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the GHS black hole's quantum horizon is constructed. The Hawking temperature is computed naturally, and the entropy can also be figured out without introducing the cutoff factor h. The Φ-field mode number is predicted too. The result is consistent with that of the Schwarzschild and R-N black hole.
We develop a theory in which there are couplings amongst Dirac spinor, dilaton and non-Riemannian gravity and explore the nature of connection-induced dilaton couplings to gravity and Dirac spinor when the theory is reformulated in terms of the Levi-Civita connection. After presenting some exact solutions without spinors, we investigate the minimal spinor couplings to the model and in conclusion we cannot find any nontrivial dilaton couplings to spinor.
I consider stationary axially symmetric solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations. These show that, in general, time-independent electric and magnetic fields acting together cause rotational effects in the spacetime. An electric charge placed on the axis of a magnetic dipole induces a region of closed timelike curves.


This paper reports on and summarizes some recent progress on gravitational shocks, i.e., discontinuities in the Riemann curvature tensor. It is shown how the constraint equations play a crucial rôle in determining the nature and propagation of the shocks. Existence results are stated and are illustrated by some examples from numerical relativity.
We show, using a covariant and gauge– invariant approach to cosmological perturbation theory, that velocity and gravitational wave perturbations of the Friedmann– Lemaître– Robertson– Walker (FLRW) model can lead to the generation and amplification of cosmic magnetic fields. It is argued that under certain conditions these fields can reach strengths capable of supporting the galactic dynamo mechanism.
On twistors, strings, and the cosmological constant.
This paper first discusses the historical context of the influential “Exact Solutions” book, which was co-authored by Malcolm MacCallum. It then makes various technical points about such solutions. It is useful to characterize solutions in terms of the properties of matter they contain or the kinds of test particle motions which are possible. It is also interesting to consider which isometries are implied by particular kinds of matter behaviour. Judging the validity of an approximation by the smallness of the tensor components can be misleading. Finally, an example is given of a result which is obvious in Newtonian theory but little understood in General Relativity.
The same but different: That might describe two metrics. On the surface CLASSI may show two metrics are locally equivalent, but buried beneath may be a wealth of further structure. This was beautifully described in a paper by Malcolm MacCallum in 1998. Here I will illustrate the effect with two flat metrics — one describing ordinary Minkowski spacetime and the other describing a threeparameter family of Gal'tsov-Letelier-Tod spacetimes. I will dig out the beautiful hidden classical singularity structure of the latter (a structure first noticed by Tod in 1994) and then show how quantum considerations can illuminate the riches. I will then discuss how quantum structure can help us understand classical singularities and metric parameters in a variety of exact solutions mined from the Exact Solutions book.
This paper describes the start of an investigation into the application of classical invariant theory to scalar polynomial invariants of the Riemann tensor. In particular, the classical methods of enumerating invariants are discussed with the aim, not achieved in this paper, of verifying Sneddon's result, obtained by explicit calculation of the invariants that the dimension of a Hilbert basis is 38.

The equivalence problem is the problem of deciding whether two metric tensors are related by a coordinate transformation or not. I give a brief historical review of work done on this problem in Stockholm around 1980.
Quadratic Hamiltonians with a linear Lie-Poisson bracket have a number of applications in mechanics. For example, the Lie-Poisson bracket <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em>(3) includes the Euler-Poinsot model describing motion of a rigid body around a fixed point under gravity and the Kirchhoff model describes the motion of a rigid body in ideal fluid. Among the applications with a Lie-Poisson bracket <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">so</em>(4) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">so</em>(3, 1) is the description of free rigid body motion in a space of constant curvature. Advances in computer algebra algorithms, in implementations and hardware, together allow the computation of Hamiltonians with higher degree first integrals providing new results in the classic search for integrable models. A computer algebra module enabling related computations in a 3-dimensional vector formalism is described.

We study a possible gravitational vacuum-effect, in which vacuum-energy variation is due to variation of gravitational field, vacuum state gains gravitational energy and releases it by spontaneous photon emissions. Based on the path-integral representation, we present a general formulation of vacuum transition matrix and energy-momentum tensor of a quantum scalar field theory in curved spacetime. Using analytical continuation of dimensionality of the phase space, we calculate the difference of vacuum-energy densities in the presence and absence of gravitational field. Using the dynamical equation of gravitational collapse, we compute the rate of vacuum state gaining gravitational energy. Computing the transition amplitude from initial vacuum state to final vacuum state in gravitational collapsing process, we show the rate and spectrum of spontaneous photon emissions for releasing gravitational energy. We compare our idea with the Schwinger idea for Sonoluminiescence and contrast our scenario with the Hawking effect.
An approximate strategy for studying the evolution of binary systems of extended objects is introduced. The stars are assumed to be polytropic ellipsoids. The surfaces of constant density maintain their ellipsoidal shape during the time evolution. The equations of hydrodynamics then reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations for the internal velocities, the principal axes of the stars and the orbital parameters. The equations of motion are given within Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism. The special case when both stars are axially symmetric fluid configurations is considered. Leading order gravitational radiation reaction is incorporated, where the quasi-static approximation is applied to the internal degrees of freedom of the stars. The influence of the stellar parameters, in particular the influence of the polytropic index <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>, on the leading order gravitational waveforms is studied.
Susskind claims in his recent book <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The Cosmic Landscape</em> that evidence for the existence and nature of ‘pocket universes’ in a multiverse would be available in the detailed nature of the Cosmic Blackbody Background Radiation that constantly bathes all parts of our observable universe. I point out that acceptance of the complex chain of argument involved does not imply possible experimental verification of multiverses at the present time. Rather this claim relates only to theoretically possible observations in the very far future of the universe.
We discuss possible variations of the effective gravitational constant with length scale, predicted by most of alternative theories of gravity and unified models of physical interactions. After giving a brief general exposition, we review in more detail the predicted corrections to Newton’s law of gravity in diverse brane world models. We consider various configurations in 5 dimensions (flat, de Sitter and AdS branes in Einstein and Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theories, with and without induced gravity and possible incomplete graviton localization), 5D multi-brane systems and some models in higher dimensions. A common feature of all models considered is the existence of corrections to Newton’s law at small radii comparable with the bulk characteristic length: at such radii, gravity on the brane becomes effectively multidimensional. Many models contain superlight perturbation modes, which modify gravity at large scale and may be important for astrophysics and cosmology.
Configuration space of general relativity is extended by inclusion of the determinant of the metric as a new independent variable. As the consequence the Hilbert–Einstein action takes a polynomial form.
The hole argument was developed by Einstein in 1913 while he was searching for a relativistic theory of gravitation. Einstein used the language of coordinate systems and coordinate invariance, rather than the language of manifolds and diffeomorphism invariance. He formulated the hole argument against covariant field equations and later found a way to avoid it using coordinate language. In this paper we shall use the invariant language of categories, manifolds and natural objects to give a coordinate-free description of the hole argument and a way of avoiding it. Finally we shall point out some important implications of further extensions of the hole argument to sets and relations for the problem of quantum gravity.
In this paper, we show that self-similarity with respect to the existence of a (purely radial) homothetic Killing vector field for spherically symmetric spacetimes implies the separability of the spacetime metric in terms of the co-moving coordinates (and vice versa) and that the metric is, uniquely, the one recently reported in (Class. Quantam Grav. 18: 2147–2162; 2001). This spacetime, in general, has non-vanishing energy flux and shear. An interesting feature of this spacetime, in contrast to other self-similar spherically symmetric spacetimes (not reducible to our form) is that it has an arbitrary radial distribution of matter.
An almost brief, though lengthy, review introduction about the long history of higher order gravities and their applications, as employed in the literature, is provided. We review the analogous procedure between higher order gravities and GR, as described in our previous works, in order to highlight/manipulate its important achievements. Amongst which are presentation of an easy classification of higher order Lagrangians and its employment as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">criteria</em> in order to distinguish correct metric theories of gravity. For example, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of the second order Lagrangians in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">isolation</em>. But, it does allow the inclusion of the cosmological term. We also discuss on the compatibility of our procedure and the Mach idea. We derive a dimensional dependent version of Duff’s trace anomaly relation, which in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">four</em>-dimension is the same as the usual Duff relation. The Lanczos Lagrangian satisfies this new constraint in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any</em> dimension. The square of the Weyl tensor identically satisfies it independent of dimension, however, this Lagrangian satisfies the previous relation only in three and four dimensions.
The unifying approach to early-time and late-time universe based on phantom cosmology is proposed. We consider gravity-scalar system which contains usual potential and scalar coupling function in front of kinetic term. As a result, the possibility of phantom–non-phantom transition appears in such a way that universe could have effectively phantom equation of state at early time as well as at late time. In fact, the oscillating universe may have several phantom and non-phantom phases. Role in each of two phase and can be absorbed into the redefinition of the scalar field. Right on the transition point, however, the factor cannot be absorbed into the redefinition and play the role to connect two phases smoothly. Holographic dark energy where infrared cutoff is identified with combination of FRW parameters: Hubble constant, particle and future horizons, cosmological constant and universe life-time (if finite). Depending on the specific choice of the model the number of interesting effects occur: the possibility to solve the coincidence problem, crossing of phantom divide and unification of early-time inflationary and late-time accelerating phantom universe. The bound for holographic entropy which decreases in phantom era is also discussed.
The Hessian of either the entropy or the energy function can be regarded as a metric on a Gibbs surface. For two parameter families of asymptotically flat black holes in arbitrary dimension one or the other of these metrics are flat, and the state space is a flat wedge. The mathematical reason for this is traced back to the scale invariance of the Einstein–Maxwell equations. The picture of state space that we obtain makes some properties such as the occurence of divergent specific heats transparent.
Singularities in the dark energy late universe are discussed, under the assumption that the Lagrangian contains the Einstein term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> plus a modified gravity term of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>α</sup>, where α is a constant. It is found, similarly as in the case of pure Einstein gravity [Brevik and Gorbunova, Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">37</strong>, 2039, 2005], that the fluid can pass from the quintessence region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &gt;  − 1) into the phantom region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &lt;  − 1) as a consequence of a bulk viscosity varying with time. It becomes necessary now, however, to allow for a two-fluid model, since the viscosities for the two components vary differently with time. No scalar fields are needed for the description of the passage through the phantom barrier.

In this paper we classified the matter collineations (MCs) of Bianchi type II spacetime according to the degenerate and non-degenerate energy-momentum tensor. It is shown that when the energy-momentum tensor is degenerate, most of the cases yield infinite dimensional MCs whereas some cases give finite dimensional Lie algebras in which there are <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">three, four</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">five</em> MCs. For the non-degenerate matter tensor cases we obtained that the Lie algebra of MCs is finite dimensional, in which the number of MCs are also <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">three, four</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">five</em>. Furthermore, we discussed the physical implications of the obtained MCs in the case of perfect fluid as source.
By matching across a surface of constant time, it is demonstrated that the spacetime for a radiation-dominated Einstein–de Sitter universe can be directly matched to the spacetime for a matter-dominated Einstein–de Sitter universe. Thus, this can serve as a model of a universe filled with radiation that suddenly is converted to matter and antimatter, or a universe filled with matter and antimatter that suddenly annihilates to leave radiation. This matching is shown to hold for asymptotically Einstein–de Sitter cosmological black hole spacetimes, yielding simplistic models of primordial black holes that evolve between being in radiation-dominated universes and matter-dominated universes.
We revisit the classical and quantum cosmology of a universe in which a self interacting scalar field is coupled to gravity with a flat FRW type metric undergoing continuous signature transition. We arrange for quantum cosmologically allowed discontinuity in the classical solutions at the signature changing hypersurface, provided these solutions be dual in some respects. This may be of some importance in the study of early universe within the signature changing scenarios.
We analyze the dynamics of an AdS<sub>5</sub> braneworld with matter fields when gravity is allowed to deviate from the Einstein form on the brane. We consider exact five-dimensional warped solutions which are associated with conformal bulk fields of weight –4 and describe on the brane the following three dynamics: those of inhomogeneous dust, of generalized dark radiation, and of homogeneous polytropic dark energy. We show that, with modified gravity on the brane, the existence of such dynamical geometries requires the presence of non-conformal matter fields confined to the brane.
We show that in a configuration of point masses, replacing one of the point deflectors by a spherically symmetric distributed mass only introduces one extra image. This extra image is located inside the radius of the distributed mass added. We extend a result available for a set of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> point masses, by showing that the maximum number of images that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> distributed lensing objects located on a plane can create is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> <sub>max</sub> = 6(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> − 1) + 1 for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> ≥ 2. Our result is generic in that the mass density for each deflector is only constrained to diverge slower than 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> approaches the center of the mass.
Here we shall find the Green’s function of the difference equation of loop quantum cosmology. To illustrate how to use it, we shall obtain an iterative solution for closed model and evaluate its corresponding Bohmian trajectory.
In this study Kaluza–Klein Cosmological solutions are obtained for quark matter coupled to the string cloud and domain wall in the context of general relativity. For this purpose Einstein field equations are solved by using anisotropy feature of the universe in the five-dimensional Kaluza–Klein Cosmological model. Also, the features of obtained solutions are discussed.
The present paper reconsiders the Newtonian limit of models of modified gravity including higher order terms in the scalar curvature in the gravitational action. This was studied using the Palatini variational principle in Meng and Wang (Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">36</strong>, 1947 (2004)) and Domínguez and Barraco (Phys. Rev. D <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">70</strong>, 043505 (2004)) with contradicting results. Here a different approach is used, and problems in the previous attempts are pointed out. It is shown that models with negative powers of the scalar curvature, like the ones used to explain the present accelerated expansion, as well as their generalization which include positive powers, can give the correct Newtonian limit, as long as the coefficients of these powers are reasonably small. Some consequences of the performed analysis seem to raise doubts for the way the Newtonian limit was derived in the purely metric approach of fourth order gravity [Dick in Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">36</strong>, 217 (2004)]. Finally, we comment on a recent paper [Olmo in Phys. Rev. D <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">72</strong>, 083505 (2005)] in which the problem of the Newtonian limit of both the purely metric and the Palatini formalism is discussed, using the equivalent Brans–Dicke theory, and with which our results partly disagree.

We use the Conformal Metric as described in Kar–Sinha work on Gravitational Bending of Light in a 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> Spacetime to recompute the equations of the 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> Force in Basini–Capozziello–Ponce De Leon Formalism and we arrive at a result that possesses some advantages. The equations of the Extra Force as proposed by Ponce De Leon are now more elegant in Conformal Formalism and many algebraic terms can be simplified or even suppressed. Also we recompute the Kar–Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light affected by the presence of the Extra Dimension and analyze the Superluminal Chung–Freese Features of this Formalism describing the advantages of the Chung–Freese BraneWorld when compared to other Superluminal spacetime metrics (e.g. Warp Drive) and we describe why the Extra Dimension is invisible and how the Extra Dimension could be made visible at least in theory. We also examine the Maartens–Clarkson Black Holes in 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> (Black Strings) coupled to massive Kaluza–Klein graviton modes predicted by Extra Dimensions theories and we study experimental detection of Extra Dimensions on-board LIGO and LISA Space Telescopes. We also propose the use of International Space Station (ISS) to measure the additional terms (resulting from the presence of Extra Dimensions) in the Kar–Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light in Outer Space to verify if we really lives in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime. Also we demonstrate that Particle <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Z</em> can only exist if the 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> spacetime exists.
We study possible restrictions on the structure of curvature corrections to gravitational theories in the context of their corresponding Kac–Moody algebras, following the initial work on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> <sub>10</sub> in Damour and Nicolai [Class Quant Grav 22:2849 (2005)]. We first emphasize that the leading quantum corrections of M-theory can be naturally interpreted in terms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">(non-gravity) fundamental weights</em> of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> <sub>10</sub>. We then heuristically explore the extent to which this remark can be generalized to all over-extended algebras by determining which curvature corrections are compatible with their weight structure, and by comparing these curvature terms with known results on the quantum corrections for the corresponding gravitational theories.
We argue that if black hole entropy arises from a finite number of underlying quantum states, then any particular such state can be identified from infinity. The finite density of states implies a discrete energy spectrum, and, in general, such spectra are non-degenerate except as determined by symmetries. Therefore, knowledge of the precise energy, and of other commuting conserved charges, determines the quantum state. In a gravitating theory, all conserved charges including the energy are given by boundary terms that can be measured at infinity. Thus, within any theory of quantum gravity, no information can be lost in black holes with a finite number of states. However, identifying the state of a black hole from infinity requires measurements with Planck scale precision. Hence observers with insufficient resolution will experience information loss.
In this essay we introduce a theoretical framework designed to describe black hole dynamics. The difficulties in understanding such dynamics stems from the proliferation of scales involved when one attempts to simultaneously describe all of the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom. These range from the modes that describe the black hole horizon, which are responsible for dissipative effects, to the long wavelength gravitational radiation that drains mechanical energy from macroscopic black hole bound states. We approach the problem from a Wilsonian point of view, by building a tower of theories of gravity each of which is valid at different scales. The methodology leads to multiple new results in diverse topics including phase transitions of Kaluza-Klein black holes and the interactions of spinning black hole in non-relativistic orbits. Moreover, our methods tie together speculative ideas regarding dualities for black hole horizons to real physical measurements in gravitational wave detectors.


We discuss the existence, arising by analogy to that in algebraically special space-times, of a unique asymptotically shear-free congruence in any asymptotically flat space-time. Associated with it is a unique complex analytic curve in H-space. The surprising potential physical significance of this curve is discussed.
We calculate the exact values of the quasinormal frequencies for an electromagnetic field and a gravitational perturbation moving in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional de Sitter spacetime (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> ≥  4). We also study the quasinormal modes of a real massive scalar field and compare our results with those of other references.
We study five dimensional thin-shell wormholes in Einstein–Maxwell theory with a Gauss–Bonnet term. The linearized stability under radial perturbations and the amount of exotic matter are analyzed as a function of the parameters of the model. We find that the inclusion of the quadratic correction substantially widens the range of possible stable configurations, and besides it allows for a reduction of the exotic matter required to construct the wormholes.
It is known that certain quantum cosmological models present quantum behavior for large scale factors. Since quantization can suppress past singularities, it is natural to inquire whether quantum effects can prevent future singularities. To this end, a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker quantum cosmological model dominated by a phantom energy fluid is investigated. The classical model displays accelerated expansion ending in a Big Rip. The quantization is performed in three different ways, which turn out to lead to the same result, namely there is a possibility that quantum gravitational effects could not remove the Big Rip.
The problem of kink stability of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find explicitly the spectrum, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran. To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only along the sonic line.
We present some results concerning the large volume limit of loop quantum cosmology in the flat homogeneous and isotropic case. We derive the Wheeler–De Witt equation in this limit. Looking for the action from which this equation can also be obtained, we then address the problem of the modifications to be brought to the Friedman’s equation and to the equation of motion of the scalar field, in the classical limit.
In this paper, we study the effects of Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and Modified Dispersion Relations (MDRs) on the thermodynamics of ultra-relativistic particles in early universe. We show that limitations imposed by GUP and particle horizon on the measurement processes, lead to certain modifications of early universe thermodynamics.
We present a new solution of the Einstein-scalar field system with minimally coupled massless scalar field and nonzero cosmological constant. The field equations are satisfied on both the four dimensional space and a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = const. three dimensional slice.
We construct thin shell Lorentzian wormholes in higher dimensional Einstein–Maxwell theory applying the ‘Cut and Paste’ technique proposed by Visser. The linearized stability is analyzed under radial perturbations around some assumed higher dimensional spherically symmetric static solution of the Einstein field equations in presence of Electromagnetic field. We determine the total amount of exotic matter, which is concentrated at the wormhole throat.
The dynamics of general relativistic timelike spherically symmetric thin shells of matter is considered, putting special emphasis on the physical interpretation of the models and, therefore, on the dependence of the dynamical behavior upon then the choice of the equation of state. From this point of view the general formalism is reviewed both in the Israel’s and in the canonical (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian) approach. Known exact solutions corresponding to closed equations of state are reviewed as well, and a new, wide class of nonlinear barotropic solutions is introduced and discussed in detail.
We perform a full second order calculation of the deflection of light along the equatorial plane in the Kerr metric. Previous Kerr deflection calculations were interested in obtaining the correction due to rotation to the Einstein deflection. By expanding to first order in the rotational parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, they obtain the Einstein deflection of 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub>o</sub> and the second order deflection due to rotation of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({4Ma/r_{\rm o}^2}\)</span> , (where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub>o</sub> is the point of closest approach). In this paper, we are interested in going beyond the rotational contribution for the purpose of astrophysical applications. We therefore keep all terms up to second order in our final weak field expansion. Besides the rotational contribution, we also obtain an extra second order term of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({7.78\,M^2/r_{\rm o}^2}\)</span> . Since <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> &gt; <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, this extra term is greater than the rotational contribution of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({4Ma/r_{\rm o}^2}\)</span> in astrophysical applications. When <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is close to unity the terms are of the same order of magnitude.
We present a new class of exact interior solutions for anisotropic spheres to the Einstein field equations with a prescribed energy density. This category of solutions has similar energy density profiles to the models of Chaisi and Maharaj (Gen. Rel. Grav. 37, 1177–1189, 2005) whose approach we follow in the integration process. A distinguishing feature of the solutions presented is that they satisfy a barotropic equation of state linearly relating the radial pressure to the energy density.

Exact interpretation of the NUT parameter becomes possible when a static Schwarzchild mass is immersed in a stationary, source free electromagnetic universe. We explain this on the basis of our solution (Halilsoy and Al-Badawi in Class Quantum Grav 12:3013, 1995), which represents the non-linear superposition of the Schwarzschild solution and the generalized Bertotti–Robinson solution.
This paper is devoted to investigating the teleparallel versions of the Friedmann models as well as the Lewis–Papapetrou solution. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields for both spacetimes. It is shown that the axial-vector vanishes for the Friedmann models. We discuss the different possibilities for the axial-vector, depending on the arbitrary functions ω and ψ in the Lewis–Papapetrou metric. The vector related to spin has also been evaluated.
Using the monodromy method we calculate the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of an electromagnetic field moving in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild de Sitter black holes (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> ≥  4). For the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter black hole we also compute these frequencies with a similar method. Moreover, we calculate the electromagnetic normal modes of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime.
Inhomogeneities are introduced in loop quantum cosmology using regular lattice states, with a kinematical arena similar to that in homogeneous models considered earlier. The framework is intended to encapsulate crucial features of background independent quantizations in a setting accessible to explicit calculations of perturbations on a cosmological background. It is used here only for qualitative insights but can be extended with further more detailed input. One can thus see how several parameters occuring in homogeneous models appear from an inhomogeneous point of view. Their physical roles in several cases then become much clearer, often making previously unnatural choices of values look more natural by providing alternative physical roles. This also illustrates general properties of symmetry reduction at the quantum level and the roles played by inhomogeneities. Moreover, the constructions suggest a picture for gravitons and other metric modes as collective excitations in a discrete theory, and lead to the possibility of quantum gravity corrections in large universes.
The Block Universe idea, representing spacetime as a fixed whole, suggests the flow of time is an illusion: the entire universe just is, with no special meaning attached to the present time. This paper points out that this view, in essence represented by usual space time diagrams, is based on time- reversible microphysical laws, which fail to capture essential features of the time-irreversible macro-physical behaviour and the development of emergent complex systems, including life, which exist in the real universe. When these are taken into account, the unchanging block universe view of spacetime is best replaced by an evolving block universe which extends as time evolves, with the potential of the future continually becoming the certainty of the past; spacetime itself evolves, as do the entities within it. However, this time evolution is not related to any preferred surfaces in spacetime; rather it is associated with the evolution of proper time along families of world lines.
We present the whole set of equations with regularity and matching conditions required for the description of physically meaningful stationary cylindrically symmmetric distributions of matter, smoothly matched to Lewis vacuum spacetime. A specific example is given. The electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor are calculated, and it is shown that purely electric solutions are necessarily static. Then, it is shown that no conformally flat stationary cylindrical fluid exits, satisfying regularity and matching conditions.
The present work has a double aim. On the one hand, we call attention on the relationship existing between the Ashtekar formalism and other gauge-theoretical approaches to gravity, in particular the Poincaré Gauge Theory. On the other hand, we study two kinds of solutions for the constraints of General Relativity, consisting of two mutually independent parts, namely a general three-metric-dependent contribution to the extrinsic curvature <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> in terms of the Cotton–York tensor, and besides it further metric independent contributions, which we analyze in particular in the presence of isotropic three-metrics.
We establish a dynamical equivalence between the bosonic part of pure type I supergravity in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 10 and a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 1 non-linear σ-model on the Kac–Moody coset space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DE</em> <sub>10</sub>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DE</em> <sub>10</sub>) if both theories are suitably truncated. To this end we make use of a decomposition of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DE</em> <sub>10</sub> under its regular <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(9,9) subgroup. Our analysis also deals partly with the fermionic fields of the supergravity theory and we define corresponding representations of the generalised spatial Lorentz group <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DE</em> <sub>10</sub>).
Antoci et al. have argued that the horizons of the boost-rotation, Kerr and Schwarzschild solutions are singular, having shown that a certain invariantly defined acceleration scalar blows up at the horizons. Their examples do not satisfy the usual definition of a singularity. It is argued that using the same term is seriously misleading and it is shown that such divergent functions are natural concomitants of regular horizons. In particular it is noted that the divergence is given by the special relativistic approximation to the overall metric. Earlier work on characterization of horizons by invariants is revisited, a new invariant criterion for them is proposed, and the relation of the acceleration invariant to the Cartan invariants, which are finite at the horizons and completely determine the spacetimes, is examined for the C-metric, Kerr and Schwarzschild cases. An appendix considers coordinate identifications at axes and horizons.

The equation of motion of cosmic string loops in Kerr–de Sitter spacetimes is derived. Having solved the equation numerically, we find that the loops can evolve except for very small ones.
The aim of this paper is to study foliations that remain invariant under parallel transport along the integral curves of vector fields of another foliation. According to this idea, we define a new concept of stability between foliations. A particular case of stability (called regular stability) is studied, giving a useful characterization in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor. This characterization allows us to prove that there are no regularly self-stable foliations of dimension greater than 1 in the Schwarzschild and Robertson–Walker space–times. Finally, we study the existence of regularly self-stable foliations in other space–times, like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em>-wave space–times.
Considering charged fluid spheres as anisotropic sources and the diffusion limit as the transport mechanism, we suppose that the inner space–time admits self-similarity. Matching the interior solution with the Reissner–Nordström–Vaidya exterior one, we find an extremely compact and oscillatory final state with a redistribution of the electric charge function and non zero pressure profiles.
A model with one compact extra dimension and a scalar field of Brans–Dicke type in the bulk is discussed. It describes two branes with non-zero tension embedded into the space-time with flat background. This setup allows one to use a very simple method for stabilization of the size of extra dimension. It appears that the four-dimensional Planck mass is expressed only through parameters of the scalar field potentials on the branes.
We give a proof that static general-relativistic stellar models, in other words static perfect fluid stars in asymptotically-flat spacetimes, are spherically symmetric for physically reasonable equations of state. The analysis may also be of independent interest for differential geometric rigidity theorems.
Our present knowledge of the distribution of matter in the local universe is reviewed. Appropriate boundaries isolating astrophysical systems are sought on the length scales of the solar system, the galaxy and the local group of galaxies. The influence of diffuse matter is compared to that of nearby objects using the geodesic deviation equation. The question of assigning realistic wave zones to some canonical sources of gravitational radiation is briefly reviewed. Taking our local environment as typical, it is found that compact systems of a size similar to that of the solar system can normally be considered isolated. Compact galactic nuclei with low matter flux can probably also be considered isolated.
The motion of a local source inducing small oscillations in the gravitational field is investigated and shown to exhibit pure rotational kinetic energy. Should the net affect of these slow, revolving oscillations cause large-scale rotations in spacetime it would certainly result in anomalous celestial accelerations. When this angular rotational frequency of spacetime is applied to the anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10/11 spacecrafts, the correlation is promising.
We consider asymptotically-flat, static and stationary solutions of the Einstein equations representing Einstein–Maxwell space–times in which the Maxwell field is not constant along the Killing vector defining stationarity, so that the symmetry of the space-time is not inherited by the electromagnetic field. We find that static degenerate black hole solutions are not possible and, subject to stronger assumptions, nor are static, non-degenerate or stationary black holes. We describe the possibilities if the stronger assumptions are relaxed.
It is shown numerically that strange matter rings permit a continuous transition to the extreme Kerr black hole. The multipoles as defined by Geroch and Hansen are studied and suggest a universal behaviour for bodies approaching the extreme Kerr solution parametrically. The appearance of a ‘throat region’, a distinctive feature of the extreme Kerr spacetime, is observed. With regard to stability, we verify for a large class of rings, that a particle sitting on the surface of the ring never has enough energy to escape to infinity along a geodesic.
It has been suggested that the cosmological constant is a variable dynamical quantity. A class of solution has been presented for the spherically symmetric space time describing wormholes by assuming the erstwhile cosmological constant Λ to be a space variable scalar, viz., Λ = Λ (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) . It is shown that the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) violating exotic matter can be made arbitrarily small.
We present the study of exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions to a four-dimensional low energy limit of string theory containing non-minimal interacting electromagnetic, dilaton and axion fields. We focus at Einstein-Rosen solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion equations. Several cases are analyzed and some of them have asymptotically velocity-term dominated (AVTD) singularities.
The idea of treating quantum general relativistic theories in a perturbative expansion around a topological theory has recently received attention, in the quantum gravity literature. We investigate the viability of this idea by applying it to conventional Yang–Mills theory on flat spacetime. This theory admits indeed a formulation as a modified topological theory, like general relativity. We find that the expansion around the topological theory coincides with the usual expansion around the free abelian theory, though the equivalence is non-trivial. In this context, the technique appears therefore to be viable, but not to bring particularly new insights. On the other hand, we point out that the relation of this expansion with the actual quantum BF theory is far from being transparent. Some implications for gravity are discussed.
We investigate the massive particle’s tunneling radiation from Schwarzchild black holes in higher-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times. Difference from the mass-less particle, the geodesics of the massive particle is not light-like, but decided by the phase velocity. We focus on s-waves, extend Parikh and Wilczek’s semi-classical tunneling method, and calculate the massive particle’s emission rate. It is shown that the emission rate is relevant to the change of the black hole’s entropy respectively, and the result takes the same functional form as that of the mass-less particle.
In the framework of renormalization-group improved cosmologies, we use the Noether symmetry approach to get exact and general integration of the matter-dominated cosmological equations. This is performed by using an expression of Λ  =  Λ (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>) determined by the method itself. We also work out a comparison between such a model and the concordance ΛCDM model as to the magnitude–redshift relationship, hence showing that no appreciable differences occur.
We study the effect of an external magnetic field on the stability of circular motion around a five dimensional Myers–Perry metric. Using the Hamilton–Jacobi formalism we derive the effective potential for the radial motion of charged particles around a five dimensional rotating black hole in a uniform magnetic field. We show that there are stable circular orbits around a five dimensional rotating black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field.

The expression of the gravitational energy-momentum defined in the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is extended to an arbitrary set of real-valued tetrad fields, by adding a suitable reference space subtraction term. The characterization of tetrad fields as reference frames is addressed in the context of the Kerr space–time. It is also pointed out that Einstein’s version of the principle of equivalence does not preclude the existence of a definition for the gravitational energy-momentum density.
It is demonstrated that due to back-reaction of quantum effects, expansion of the universe stops at its maximum and takes a turn around. Later on, it contracts to a very small size in finite future time. This phenomenon is followed by a “bounce” with re-birth of an exponentially expanding non-singular universe.
The two exterior solutions for a charged line-mass are examined. In both cases the mass per unit length is negative.
We build extended sources for the Reissner-Nordström metric. Our models describe a neutral perfect fluid core bounded by a charged thin shell, and feature everywhere positive rest mass density and everywhere non-negative active gravitational mass, as well as classical electron radius and electromagnetic total mass. We contrast our results with previously discussed charged anisotropic fluid models which excluded the thin shell and presented similar properties. Our charged thin shells are restricted by the 2D texture equation of state which causes the continuity of the active gravitational mass, in spite of the singularity of the energy-momentum tensor. We mention possible extensions of this study suggested by modified active mass formulae proposed in the literature.
All homothetic self-similar solutions of the Brans-Dicke scalar field in three-dimensional spacetime with circular symmetry are found in closed form.
It is demonstrated that the Melvin universe representing the spacetime with a strong ‘homogeneous’ electric field can by obtained from the spacetime of two accelerated charged black holes by a suitable limiting procedure. The behavior of various invariantly defined geometrical quantities in this limit is also studied.
It is often claimed that the asymptotic behaviour of the Brans–Dicke solutions versus general relativity, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\omega \longrightarrow \infty }\)</span> , is related to the trace of the stress tensor. Considering the standard Euclidean cosmological model, we argue that this claim is not correct. On the other hand, we argue that this behaviour depends on the property of the considered solutions versus stationarity and asymptotical flatness.
Using a general classification of dark enegy models in four classes, we discuss the complementarity of cosmological observations to tackle down the physics beyond the acceleration of our universe. We discuss the tests distinguishing the four classes and then focus on the dynamics of the perturbations in the Newtonian regime. We also exhibit explicitely models that have identical predictions for a subset of observations.
We analyze the space-times admitting two shear-free geodesic null congruences. The integrability conditions are presented in a plain tensorial way as equations on the volume element <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> of the time-like 2-plane that these directions define. From these we easily deduce significant consequences. We obtain explicit expressions for the Ricci and Weyl tensors in terms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> and its first and second order covariant derivatives. We study the different compatible Petrov-Bel types and give the necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize every type in terms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>. The type D case is analyzed in detail and we show that every type D space-time admitting a 2 + 2 conformal Killing tensor also admits a conformal Killing-Yano tensor.
Symmetric hyperbolic systems of equations are explicitly constructed for a general class of tensor fields by considering their structure as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-fold forms. The hyperbolizations depend on 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>−1 arbitrary timelike vectors. The importance of the so-called “superenergy” tensors, which provide the necessary symmetric positive matrices, is emphasized and made explicit. Thereby, a unified treatment of many physical systems is achieved, as well as of the sometimes called “higher order” systems. The characteristics of these symmetric hyperbolic systems are always physical, and directly related to the null directions of the superenergy tensor, which are in particular principal null directions of the tensor field solutions. Generic energy estimates and inequalities are presented too. Examples are included, in particular a mixed gravitational-scalar field system at the level of the Bianchi equations.
The geodesic equation in induced matter theory is redefined. It is shown that the extra forces do not change the four-impulse of massive particles. We show that the 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> space-time is non-integrable and find the relation between non-integrability and the Mach’s principal.
The deflection of light rays by rotating gravitational lens is considered in the framework of higher-order gravitational theory. The bending angle of light is derived. The effect of the massive scalar and tensor components of higher-order gravitational field as well as the gravito-magnetic on light deflection are discussed.
In the extensive literature dealing with the relativistic phenomenon of Thomas rotation several methods have been developed for calculating the Thomas rotation angle of a gyroscope along a circular world line. One of the most appealing concepts, introduced in Rindler and Perlick (Gen Rel Grav 22:1067, 1990), is to consider a rotating reference frame co-moving with the gyroscope, and relate the precession of the gyroscope to the angular velocity of the reference frame. A recent paper (Herrera and di Prisco in Found Phys Lett 15:373, 2002), however, applies this principle to three different co-moving rotating reference frames and arrives at three different Thomas rotation angles. The reason for this apparent paradox is that the principle of Rindler and Perlick (Gen Rel Grav 22:1067, 1990) is used for a situation to which it does not apply. In this paper we rigorously examine the theoretical background and limitations of applicability of the principle of Rindler and Perlick (Gen Rel Grav 22:1067, 1990). Along the way we also establish some general properties of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rotating reference frames</em>, which may be of independent interest.
We study the coupling of massive fermions to the quantum mechanical dynamics of spacetime emerging from the spinfoam approach in three dimensions. We first recall the classical theory before constructing a spinfoam model of quantum gravity coupled to spinors. The technique used is based on a finite expansion in inverse fermion masses leading to the computation of the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude of the theory. The path integral is derived as a sum over closed fermionic loops wrapping around the spinfoam. The effects of quantum torsion are realised as a modification of the intertwining operators assigned to the edges of the two-complex, in accordance with loop quantum gravity. The creation of non-trivial curvature is modelled by a modification of the pure gravity vertex amplitudes. The appendix contains a review of the geometrical and algebraic structures underlying the classical coupling of fermions to three dimensional gravity.
The DGP brane world model allows us to get the observed late time acceleration via modified gravity, without the need for a “dark energy” field. This can then be generalised by the inclusion of high energy terms, in the form of a Gauss-Bonnet bulk. This is the basis of the Gauss-Bonnet-Induced-Gravity (GBIG) model explored here with both early and late time modifications to the cosmological evolution. Recently the simplest GBIG models (Minkowski bulk and no brane tension) have been analysed. Two of the three possible branches in these models start with a finite density “Big-Bang” and with late time acceleration. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of more general models where we include a bulk cosmological constant and brane tension. We show that by including these factors it is possible to have late time phantom behaviour.
In this paper we consider a model universe with large extra dimensions to obtain a modified black hole entropy-area relation. We use the generalized uncertainty principle to find a relation between the number of spacetime dimensions and the presence or vanishing of logarithmic prefactor in the black hole entropy-area relation. Our calculations are restricted to the microcanonical ensembles and we show that in the modified entropy-area relation, the microcanonical logarithmic prefactor appears only when spacetime has an even number of dimensions.
The various requirements on a consistent varying speed of light (‘VSL’) theory are surveyed, giving a short check-list that needs to be satisfied by such theories.
We show by an almost elementary calculation that the ADM mass of an asymptotically flat space can be computed as a limit involving a rate of change of area of a closed 2-surface. The result is essentially the same as that given by David Brown and York (Phys. Rev. D <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">55</strong>, 1977–1984 1997; Phys. Rev. D <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">47</strong>, 1407–1419 1993). We will prove this result in two ways, first by direct calculation from the original formula as given by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner and second as a corollary of an earlier result by Brewin for the case of simplicial spaces.
We show that the isentropic subclass of Buchdahl’s exact solution for a gaseous relativistic star is stable and gravitationally bound for all values of the compactness ratio <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> [≡ (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>), where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is the total mass and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> is the radius of the configuration in geometrized units] in the range, 0 &lt;  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> ≤  0.20, corresponding to the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">regular</em> behaviour of the solution. This result is in agreement with the expectation and opposite to the earlier claim found in the literature.


Using the generalised invariant formalism we derive a special subclass of conformally flat spacetimes whose Ricci tensor has a pure radiation and a Ricci scalar component. The method used is a development of the methods used earlier for pure radiation spacetimes of Petrov types O and N, respectively. In this paper we demonstrate how to handle, in the generalised invariant formalism, spacetimes with isotropy freedom and rich Killing vector structure. Once the spacetimes have been constructed, it is straightforward to deduce their Karlhede classification: the Karlhede algorithm terminates at the fourth derivative order, and the spacetimes all have one degree of null isotropy and three, four or five Killing vectors.
We obtain the quasinormal modes for tensor perturbations of Gauss–Bonnet (GB) black holes in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> = 5, 7, 8 dimensions and vector perturbations in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> =  5, 6, 7 and 8 dimensions using third order WKB formalism. The tensor perturbation for black holes in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> = 6 is not considered because of the fact that the black hole is unstable to tensor mode perturbations. In the case of uncharged GB black hole, for both tensor and vector perturbations, the real part of the QN frequency increases as the Gauss–Bonnet coupling (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α′</em>) increases. The imaginary part first decreases upto a certain value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α′</em> and then increases with α′ for both tensor and vector perturbations. For larger values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α′</em>, the QN frequencies for vector perturbation differs slightly from the QN frequencies for tensorial one. It has also been shown that as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α′</em> → 0, the quasinormal frequencies for tensor and vector perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole can be obtained. We have also calculated the quasinormal spectrum of the charged GB black hole for tensor perturbations. Here we have found that the real oscillation frequency increases, while the imaginary part of the frequency falls with the increase of the charge. We also show that the quasinormal frequencies for scalar field perturbations and the tensor gravitational perturbations do not match as was claimed in the literature. The difference in the result increases if we increase the GB coupling.
We consider the metric exterior to a charged dilaton black hole in a de Sitter universe. We study the motion of a test particle in this metric. Conserved quantities are identified and the Hamilton–Jacobi method is employed for the solutions of the equations of motion. At large distances from the black hole the Hubble expansion of the universe modifies the effective potential such that bound orbits could exist up to an upper limit of the angular momentum per mass for the orbiting test particle. We then study the phenomenon of strong field gravitational lensing by these black holes by extending the standard formalism of strong lensing to the non-asymptotically flat dilaton-de Sitter metric. Expressions for the various lensing quantities are obtained in terms of the metric coefficients.
New rotating dyonic dipole black ring solutions are derived in 5D Einstein-dilaton gravity with antisymmetric forms. The black rings are analyzed and their thermodynamics is discussed. New dyonic black string solutions are also presented.
The Klein–Gordon equations are solved for the case of a plane-symmetric static massless scalar field in general relativity with cosmological constant, generalizing the solutions found by Taub, Novotny and Horsky, and Singh. A separate class of solutions is obtained in which the metrics reduce to flat space in the limit that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \rightarrow 0\)</span>.The static solutions can be used to generate time-dependent cosmological solutions, one of which exhibits rapid inflation followed by continued exponential expansion at all later times.
A family of static solutions of the Einstein field equations with spherical symmetry for a locally anisotropic fluid with homogeneous energy density is obtained. These solutions depend on two adjustable parameters related to degree of anisotropy of the fluid. Some known solutions may be recovered for specific values of these parameters. As a difference to other known solutions it is possible to change the grade of anisotropy of the model, keeping the same functional dependence on the coordinates. By means of a slow adiabatic contraction, the stability of the obtained solutions is studied. Also, it is shown, how it is possible to enhance the stability of the models by adjusting the parameters, and to obtain more compact configurations than those obtained with other similar anisotropic solutions, while the dominant or strong energy condition holds within the sphere.
A modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) model of unifying dark energy and dark matter is considered in this paper, in which dark energy interacts with dark matter. Concretely, the evolution of such a unified dark sectors model is studied and the statefinder diagnostic to the MCG model is performed in our model. By analysis, it is shown that the effective equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy can cross the so-called phantom divide <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> = −1, the behavior of MCG will be like ΛCDM in the future and therefore our Universe will not end up with Big Rip in the future. Furthermore, we plot the evolution trajectories of the MCG model in the statefinder parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>–<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> plane and illustrate the discrimination between this scenario and the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model.
The kink stability of self-similar solutions of a massless scalar field with circular symmetry in 2 + 1 gravity is studied, and found that such solutions are unstable against the kink perturbations along the sonic line (self-similar horizon). However, when perturbations outside the sonic line are considered, and taking the ones along the sonic line as their boundary conditions, we find that non-trivial perturbations do not exist. In other words, the consideration of perturbations in the whole spacetime limits the unstable mode of the perturbations found along the sonic line, and the kink instability rises because of the incomplete treatment of the problem. As a result, the critical solution for the scalar collapse remains critical even after the kink perturbations are taken into account.
A common misconception about laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves purports that, because the wavelength of laser light and the length of an interferometer’s arm are both stretched by a gravitational wave, no effect should be visible, invoking an analogy with cosmological redshift in an expanding universe. The issue is clarified with the help of a direct calculation.




We obtain an approximate global stationary and axisymmetric solution of Einstein’s equations which can be considered as a simple star model: a self-gravitating perfect fluid ball with constant mass density rotating in rigid motion. Using the post-Minkowskian formalism (weak-field approximation) and considering rotation as a perturbation (slow-rotation approximation), we find second-order approximate interior and exterior (asymptotically flat) solutions to this problem in harmonic and quo-harmonic coordinates. In both cases, interior and exterior solutions are matched, in the sense of Lichnerowicz, on the surface of zero pressure to obtain a global solution. The resulting metric depends on three arbitrary constants: mass density, rotational velocity and the star radius at the non-rotation limit. The mass, angular momentum, quadrupole moment and other constants of the exterior metric are determined by these three parameters. It is easy to check that Kerr’s metric cannot be the exterior part of that metric.
We use Fermi coordinates to calculate the canonical partition function for an ideal gas in a circular geodesic orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime. To test the validity of the results we prove theorems for limiting cases. We recover the Newtonian gas law subject only to tidal forces in the Newtonian limit. Additionally we recover the special relativistic gas law as the radius of the orbit increases to infinity. We also discuss how the method can be extended to the non ideal gas case.
We rigorously prove that for compact charged general relativistic objects there is a lower bound for the mass–radius ratio. This result follows from the same Buchdahl type inequality for charged objects, which has been extensively used for the proof of the existence of an upper bound for the mass–radius ratio. The effect of the vacuum energy (a cosmological constant) on the minimum mass is also taken into account. Several bounds on the total charge, mass and the vacuum energy for compact charged objects are obtained from the study of the Ricci scalar invariants. The total energy (including the gravitational one) and the stability of the objects with minimum mass–radius ratio is also considered, leading to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged objects with minimum mass–radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy only.
We present a new solution for the rotation curves of galactic disks with gravitational potential of the Yukawa type. We follow the technique employed by Toomre in 1963 in the study of galactic disks in the Newtonian theory. This new solution allows an easy comparison between the Newtonian solution and the Yukawian one. Therefore, constraints on the parameters of theories of gravitation can be imposed, which in the weak field limit reduce to Yukawian potentials. We then apply our formulae to the study of rotation curves for a zero-thickness exponential disk and compare it with the Newtonian case studied by Freeman in 1970. As an application of the mathematical tool developed here, we show that in any theory of gravity with a massive graviton (this means a gravitational potential of the Yukawa type), a strong limit can be imposed on the mass (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> <sub>g</sub>) of this particle. For example, in order to obtain a galactic disk with a scale length of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>∼ 10 kpc, we should have a massive graviton of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> <sub>g</sub> ≪ 10<sup>−59</sup>g. This result is much more restrictive than those inferred from solar system observations.
We analyze the constraint equation giving allowed solutions describing fields and currents in a force-free magnetosphere around a rotating black hole. Utilizing the divergence properties of the energy and angular-momentum fluxes, for physically allowed solutions with nonzero energy and angular momentum extraction, we conclude that poloidal surfaces are independent of the radial coordinate for large values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>. Imposing this requirement and the Znajek regularity condition, we explicitly derive all possible exact solutions admitted by the constraint equation for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> independent poloidal surfaces which are given in terms of the electromagnetic angular velocity function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Omega = 1/a \sin^2 \theta}\)</span> , where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> is the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole. Further, we show that for the class of solutions we have developed there is no electromagnetic extraction of energy.
The classical trajectories for FLRW universe with varying speed of light are obtained for the cases in which the cosmological constant depends or not depend on the velocity of light. The theory is then quantized and the corresponding WDW equation is solved. It is shown that the method of causal interpretation of Bohm can be applied successfully to the theory. Finally the Bohmian trajectories are obtained and compared with the classical ones.
We study the asymptotic behavior of the spherically symmetric solutions of the system obtained from the dimensional reduction of the six-dimensional Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet action. We show that in general the scalar field that parametrizes the size of the internal space is not trivial, but nevertheless the solutions depend on a single parameter. In analogy with other models containing Gauss–Bonnet terms, naked singularities are avoided if a minimal radius for the horizon is assumed.
We examine here spherical gravitational collapse of a matter model with vanishing radial pressure and non-zero tangential pressure. It is seen analytically that the collapsing cloud either forms a black hole or disperses depending on values of the initial parameters which are initial density, tangential pressure and velocity profile of the cloud. A threshold of black hole formation is observed near which a scaling relation is obtained for the mass of black hole, assuming initial profiles to be smooth. The similarities in the behaviour of this model at the onset of black hole formation with that of numerical critical behaviour in other collapse models are indicated.
We use the approach used by Eguchi–Hanson in constructing four-dimensional instanton metrics and construct a class of regular six-dimensional instantons which are nothing but <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> resolved conifolds. We then also obtain D3-brane solutions on these EH-resolved conifolds.
In this paper, we have examined magnetized quark and strange quark matter in the spherical symmetric space–time admitting one-parameter group of conformal motions. For this purpose, we have solved Einstein’s field equations for spherical symmetric space–time via conformal motions. Also, we have discussed the features of the obtained solutions.
An outstanding challenge for models of non-perturbative quantum gravity is the consistent formulation and quantitative evaluation of physical phenomena in a regime where geometry and matter are strongly coupled. After developing appropriate technical tools, one is interested in measuring and classifying how the quantum fluctuations of geometry alter the behaviour of matter, compared with that on a fixed background geometry. In the simplified context of two dimensions, we show how a method invented to analyze the critical behaviour of spin systems on flat lattices can be adapted to the fluctuating ensemble of curved spacetimes underlying the causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) approach to quantum gravity. We develop a systematic counting of embedded graphs to evaluate the thermodynamic functions of the gravity-matter models in a high- and low-temperature expansion. For the case of the Ising model, we compute the series expansions for the magnetic susceptibility on CDT lattices and their duals up to orders 6 and 12, and analyze them by ratio method, Dlog Padé and differential approximants. Apart from providing evidence for a simplification of the model’s analytic structure due to the dynamical nature of the geometry, the technique introduced can shed further light on criteria à la Harris and Luck for the influence of random geometry on the critical properties of matter systems.
We present exact quantum solutions for a noncommutative, multidimensional cosmological model and show that stabilization of extra dimensions sets in with the introduction of noncommutativity between the scale factors. An interpretation is offered to accommodate the notion of time, rendering comparison with the classical solutions possible.
Based on an explicit computation of the scattering amplitude of four open membranes in a constant 3-form background, we construct a toy model of the field theory for open membranes in the large <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> field limit. It is a generalization of the noncommutative field theories which describe open strings in a constant 2-form flux. The noncommutativity due to the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>-field background is now replaced by a nonassociative triplet product. The triplet product satisfies the consistency conditions of lattice 3D gravity, which is inherent in the world-volume theory of open membranes. We show the UV/IR mixing of the toy model by computing some Feynman diagrams. Inclusion of the internal degree of freedom is also possible through the idea of the cubic matrix.
Recently, Dadhich et al. (Phys. Lett. B <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">487</strong>, 1, 2000) have discovered a black hole solution localized on a three brane in five dimensional gravity in the Randall–Sundrum scenario. In this article, we develop a new class of thin shell wormhole by surgically grafting above two black hole spacetimes. Various aspects of this thin wormhole are also analyzed.
We deduce the explicit form of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">phase-locked</em> (PL) tetrad, adapted to a small spinning particle (a test <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gyroscope</em>) following an arbitrary geodesic orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry of a gravitational source. We subsequently obtain the analytic expression of the gyroscopic precessional velocity <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Ω</strong> in a non-circular orbit, by means of the Fermi rotation coefficients related to the tetrad’s transport law. As an application, we compute the orbital shift in the spin vector, considering a spinning test particle (the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gyroscope</em>) in a slightly non-circular orbital motion in the weak gravitational field limit. We compare our results with those of other previous works.
A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
We give a comparative description of different types of regular static, spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) and discuss in more detail their particular type, which we suggest to call black universes. The latter have a Schwarzschild-like causal structure, but inside the horizon there is an expanding Kantowski–Sachs universe and a de Sitter infinity instead of a singularity. Thus a hypothetic BH explorer gets a chance to survive. Solutions of this kind are naturally obtained if one considers static, spherically symmetric distributions of various (but not all) kinds of phantom matter whose existence is favoured by cosmological observations. It also looks possible that our Universe has originated from phantom-dominated collapse in another universe and underwent isotropization after crossing the horizon. An explicit example of a black-universe solution with positive Schwarzschild mass is discussed.
This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetric solutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing these solutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor are evaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along ρ and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on the metric function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> are discussed. The vector related with spin has also been evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further, we use the teleparallel version of Möller prescription to find the energy–momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that (for λ = 1) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are equal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in each, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss the two special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.
In this paper, we evaluated the quasinormal modes of electromagnetic perturbation in a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by the static spherically symmetric quintessence by using the third-order WKB approximation when the quintessential state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> </sub> in the range of −1/3 &lt;  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> </sub> &lt;  0. Due to the presence of quintessence, Maxwell field damps more slowly. And when at −1 &lt;  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> </sub> &lt;  −1/3, it is similar to the black hole solution in the ds/Ads spacetime. The appropriate boundary conditions need to be modified.
We find exact solutions to the Dirac equation in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Using these solutions we analytically calculate the de Sitter quasinormal (QN) frequencies of the Dirac field. For the massive Dirac field this computation is similar to that previously published for massive fields of half-integer spin moving in four dimensions. However to calculate the QN frequencies of the massless Dirac field we must use distinct methods in odd and even dimensions, therefore the computation is different from that already known for other massless fields of integer spin.
Following the technique of Müller zum Hagen (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 67: 415–421, 1970) we show that strictly static and strictly stationary solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations are analytic in harmonic coordinates. This holds whether or not the Maxwell field inherits the symmetry.






We construct a Hamiltonian formulation for the class of plane-fronted gravitational waves with parallel rays (pp-waves). Because of the existence of a light-like Killing vector, the dynamics is effectively reduced to a 2+1 evolution with “time” chosen to be light-like. In spite of the vanishing action this allows us to geometrically identify a symplectic form as well as dynamical Hamiltonian, thus casting the system into canonical form.
This paper considers the quantum collapse of infinitesimally thin dust shells in 2 + 1 gravity. In 2 + 1 gravity a shell is no longer a sphere, but a ring of matter. The classical equation of motion of such shells in terms of variables defined on the shell has been considered by Peleg and Steif (Phys Rev D 51:3992, 1995), using the 2 + 1 version of the original formulation of Israel (Nuovo Cimento B 44:1, 1966), and Crisóstomo and Olea (Phys Rev D 69:104023, 2004), using canonical methods. The minisuperspace quantum problem can be reduced to that of a harmonic oscillator in terms of the curvature radius of the shell, which allows us to use well-known methods to find the motion of coherent wave packets that give the quantum collapse of the shell. Classically, as the radius of the shell falls below a certain point, a horizon forms. In the quantum problem one can define various quantities that give “indications” of horizon formation. Without a proper definition of a “horizon” in quantum gravity, these can be nothing but indications.
We discuss the Ashtekar formalism from the point of view of 12 dimensions. We first focus on the 2 + 10 spacetime signature and then we consider the transition 2 + 10 → (2 + 2) + (0 + 8). We argue that both sectors 2 + 2 and 0 + 8, which are exceptional signatures, can be analyzed from the point of view of a self-dual action associated with the Ashtekar formalism.
We consider a formalism by which gauge theories can be constructed on noncommutative space time structures. The coordinates are supposed to form an algebra, restricted by certain requirements that allow us to realise the algebra in terms of star products. In this formulation it is useful to define derivatives and to extend the algebra of coordinates by these derivatives. The elements of this extended algebra are deformed differential operators. We then show that there is a morphism between these deformed differential operators and the usual higher order differential operators acting on functions of commuting coordinates. In this way we obtain deformed gauge transformations and a deformed version of the algebra of diffeomorphisms. The deformation of these algebras can be clearly seen in the category of Hopf algebras. The comultiplication will be twisted. These twisted algebras can be realised on noncommutative spaces and allow the construction of deformed gauge theories and deformed gravity theory.
A surface of codimension higher than one embedded in an ambient space possesses a connection associated with the rotational freedom of its normal vector fields. We examine the Yang–Mills functional associated with this connection. The theory it defines differs from Yang–Mills theory in that it is a theory of surfaces. We focus, in particular, on the Euler-Lagrange equations describing this surface, introducing a framework which throws light on their relationship to the Yang–Mills equations.
We present a discussion of the fundamental loss of unitarity that appears in quantum mechanics due to the use of a physical apparatus to measure time. This induces a decoherence effect that is independent of any interaction with the environment and appears in addition to any usual environmental decoherence. The discussion is framed self consistently and aimed to general physicists. We derive the modified Schrödinger equation that arises in quantum mechanics with real clocks and discuss the theoretical and potential experimental implications of this process of decoherence.
We discuss a large class of phenomenological models incorporating quantum gravity motivated corrections to electrodynamics. The framework is that of electrodynamics in a birefringent and dispersive medium with non-local constitutive relations, which are considered up to second order in the inverse of the energy characterizing the quantum gravity scale. The energy-momentum tensor, Green functions and frequency dependent refraction indices are obtained, leading to departures from standard physics. The effective character of the theory is also emphasized by introducing a frequency cutoff Ω. The analysis of its effects upon the standard notion of causality is performed, showing that in the radiation regime (Ω <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> ≫ 1) the expected corrections of the order (ω/Ω)<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> get further suppressed by highly oscillating terms proportional to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sin(\Omega R), \cos(\Omega R)\)</span> , thus forbiding causality violations to show up in the corresponding observational effects.
We resort to the methods of statistical mechanics in order to determine the effects that a deformed dispersion relation has upon the thermodynamics of a photon gas. The ensuing modifications to the density of states, partition function, pressure, internal energy, entropy, and specific heat are calculated. It will be shown that the breakdown of Lorentz invariance can be interpreted as a repulsive interaction, among the photons. Additionally, it will be proved that the presence of a deformed dispersion relation entails an increase in the entropy of the system. In other words, as a consequence of the loss of the aforementioned symmetry the number of microstates available to the corresponding equilibrium state grows.
Testing extra dimensions at low-energies may lead to interesting effects. In this work a test point charge is taken to move uniformly in the 3D subspace of a (3 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>)-brane embedded in a (3 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 1)-space with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> compact and one warped infinite spatial extra dimensions. We found that the electromagnetic potentials of the point charge match standard Liennard–Wiechert’s at large distances but differ from them close to it. These are finite at the position of the charge and produce finite self-energies. We also studied a localized Hydrogen atom and take the deviation from the standard Coulomb potential as a perturbation. This produces a Lamb shift that is compared with known experimental data to set bounds for the parameter of the model. This work provides details and extends results reported in a previous Letter.
We present a general setup for inflation in string theory where the inflaton field corresponds to Wilson lines in compact space in the presence of magnetic fluxes. T-dualities and limits on the value of the magnetic fluxes relate this system to the standard D-brane inflation scenarios, such as brane-antibrane inflation, D3/D7 brane inflation and different configurations of branes at angles. This can then be seen as a generalised approach to inflation from open string modes. Inflation ends when the Wilson lines achieve a critical value and an open string mode becomes tachyonic. Then hybrid-like inflation, including its cosmic string remnants, is realized in string theory beyond the brane annihilation picture. Our formalism can be incorporated within flux-induced moduli stabilisation mechanisms in type IIB strings. Also, contrary to the standard D-brane separation, Wilson lines can be considered in heterotic string models. We provide explicit examples to illustrate similarities and differences of our mechanism to D-brane inflation. In particular we present an example in which the η problem present in brane inflation models is absent in our case. We have examples with both blue and red tilted spectral index and remnant cosmic string tension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}\)</span> .
We show by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions that a sufficient condition can be derived which determines when a local experiment will detect the cosmological variation of a scalar field which is driving the spacetime variation of a supposed constant of Nature. We extend our earlier analyses of this problem by including the possibility that the local region is undergoing collapse inside a virialised structure, like a galaxy or galaxy cluster. We show by direct calculation that the sufficient condition is met to high precision in our own local region and we can therefore legitimately use local observations to place constraints upon the variation of “constants” of Nature on cosmological scales.
The scalar–tensor theory of gravity with the Higgs field as scalar field is presented. For central symmetry it reproduces the empirically measured flat rotation curves of galaxies. We approximate the galaxy by a polytropic gas sphere with the polytropic index <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> = 2 and a massive core.
We start with a model where the dark matter is of scalar field nature, which condensates and form the dark halos of galaxies. In this work we study Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) where the scalar field particles are in many different states, and not only in the ground state, as in a realistic BEC. We find that this model is in better agreement with the rotation curves of galaxies than previous models with scalar field dark matter.
This paper shows that a hyperbolic equation for heat conduction can be obtained directly using the tenets of linear irreversible thermodynamics in the context of the five dimensional space-time metric originally proposed by T. Kaluza back in 1922. The associated speed of propagation is slightly lower than the speed of light by a factor inversely proportional to the specific charge of the fluid element. Moreover, consistency with the second law of thermodynamics is achieved. Possible implications in the context of physics of clusters of galaxies of this result are suggested.
We address the problem of defining the concept of entropy for anisotropic cosmological models. In particular, we analyze for the Bianchi I and V models the entropy which follows from postulating the validity of the laws of standard thermodynamics in cosmology. Moreover, we analyze the Cardy–Verlinde construction of entropy and show that it cannot be associated with the one following from relativistic thermodynamics.
In this work we investigate loop variables in Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We analyze the parallel transport of vectors and spinors along several paths in this spacetime in order to classify its global properties. Band holonomy invariance is analysed in this background.
We discuss the possibility that the detection of gravitational waves emitted by compact stars may allow to constrain the MIT bag model of quark matter equation of state. Our results show that the combined knowledge of the frequency of the emitted gravitational wave and of the mass, or the radiation radius, of the source allows one to discriminate between strange stars and neutron stars and set stringent bounds on the bag constants.
In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically distributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases, i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of two fluids given by c<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> , d<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub>. It is shown that the high-speed approximation scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> <sub>2</sub> when c<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> , d<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> are bounded below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the uncertainty on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used, the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and consequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation of the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa (Prog Theor Phys 113:73, 2005) for the perfect fluid.
We study the stability of general relativistic static thick disks. As an application we consider the thick disk generated by applying the “displace, cut, fill and reflect” method, usually known as the image method, to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates. The isotropic Schwarzschild thick disk obtained from this method is the simplest model to describe, in the context of General Relativity, real thick galaxies. Stability under a general first order perturbation of the disk energy momentum tensor is investigated. The first order perturbation, when applied to the conservation equations, leads to a set of differential equations that have fewer equations than unknowns. In this article we search for perturbations in which the perturbation of the four velocity in a certain direction leads to a pressure perturbation in the same direction. We found that, in general, the isotropic Schwarzschild thick disk is stable under these kinds of perturbations.
We build up a detailed description of the space-time boundary of a Poincaré patch of anti-de Sitter (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em>) space. We map the Poincaré <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> boundary to the global coordinate chart and show why this boundary is not equivalent to the global <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> boundary. The Poincaré <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> boundary is shown to contain points of the bulk of the entire <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> space. The Euclidean <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> space is also discussed. In this case one can define a semi-global chart that divides the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> space in the same way as the corresponding Euclidean Poincaré chart.
Solar System tests give nowadays constraints on the estimated value of the cosmological constant, which can be accurately derived from different experiments regarding gravitational redshift, light deflection, gravitational time-delay and geodesic precession. Assuming that each reasonable theory of gravitation should satisfy Solar System tests, we use these limits on the estimated value of the cosmological constant to constrain extended theories of Gravity, which are nowadays studied as possible theories for cosmological models and provide viable solutions to the cosmological constant problem and the explanation of the present acceleration of the Universe. We obtain that the estimated values, from Solar System tests, for the parameters appearing in the extended theories of Gravity are orders of magnitude bigger than the values obtained in the framework of cosmologically relevant theories.
After the nontrivial quantum parameters Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> and quantum potentials <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> obtained in our previous research, the circumstance of a real scalar wave in the bulk is studied with the similar method of Brevik and Simonsen (Gen. Rel. Grav. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">33</strong>:1839, 2001). The equation of a massless scalar field is solved numerically under the boundary conditions near the inner horizon <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> </sub> and the outer horizon <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub>. Unlike the usual wave function Ψ<sub>ω<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> </sub> in 4D, quantum number <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> introduces a new functions Ψ<sub>ω<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub>, whose potentials are higher and wider with bigger <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. Using the tangent approximation, a full boundary value problem about the Schr<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ö</em>dinger-like equation is solved. With a convenient replacement of the 5D continuous potential by square barrier, the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained. If extra dimension does exist and is visible at the neighborhood of black holes, the unique wave function Ψ<sub>ω<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> may say something to it.
We show that any solution of the 4D Einstein equations of general relativity in vacuum with a cosmological constant may be embedded in a solution of the 5D Ricci-flat equations with an effective 4D cosmological “constant” Λ that is a specific function of the extra coordinate. For unified theories of the forces in higher dimensions, this has major physical implications.
We set constraints and an upper bound on the masses required for a configuration of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> point lenses to produce the maximum of 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> − 5 images of a distant source. We show how this result can be used to detect and constrain the mass of planets or brown dwarfs in multiple-star systems.
We study, in some detail, the linear stability of closed timelike curves in the Gödel universe. We show that these curves are stable. We present a simple extension (deformation) of the Gödel metric that contains a class of closed timelike curves similar to the ones associated to the original metric. This extension correspond to the addition of matter whose energy-momentum tensor is analyzed. We find the conditions to have matter that satisfies the usual energy conditions. We study the stability of closed timelike curves in the presence of usual matter as well as in the presence of exotic matter (matter that does satisfy the above mentioned conditions). We find that the closed timelike curves in the Gödel universe with or without the inclusion of regular or exotic matter are stable under linear perturbations. We also find a sort of structural stability.
We apply the ADM 3 + 1 formalism to derive the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations for cold plasma in spatially flat Schwarzschild metric. Respective perturbed equations are linearized for non-magnetized and magnetized plasmas both in non-rotating and rotating backgrounds. These are then Fourier analyzed and the corresponding dispersion relations are obtained. These relations are discussed for the existence of waves with positive angular frequency in the region near the horizon. Our results support the fact that no information can be extracted from the Schwarzschild black hole. It is concluded that negative phase velocity propagates in the rotating background whether the black hole is rotating or non-rotating.
The induced Einstein equation on a perturbed brane in the Induced Matter Theory is re-analyzed. We indicate that in a conformally flat background, the local quantum corrections to the Einstein equation can be obtained via the IMT. Using the FRW metric as the 4D gravitational model, we show that the classical fluctuations of the brane may be related to the quantum corrections to the classical Einstein equation. In other words, the induced Einstein equation on the perturbed brane can correspond with the semiclassical Einstein equation.
We write the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations of motion for a spinning particle in a stationary spacetime using the quasi-Maxwell formalism and give an interpretation of the coupling between spin and curvature. The formalism is then used to compute equilibrium positions for spinning particles in the NUT spacetime.
The massive spin-2 quantum gauge theory previously developed is applied to calculate gravitational bremsstrahlung. It is shown that this theory is unique and free from defects. In particular, there is no strong coupling if the graviton mass becomes small. The cross sections go over smoothly into the ones of the massless theory in the limit of vanishing graviton mass. The massless cross sections are calculated for the full tensor theory.
Considering the unfixed background space-time and self-gravitational interaction, we view the Hawking radiation of a stationary Kerr–Newman black hole by Hamilton–Jacobi method. Meanwhile, extending this work to non-stationary black holes, we attempt to investigate the Hawking radiation of the non-stationary Kerr–Newman black hole. Both of the results show the tunneling probabilities are related to the change of Bekenstein- Hawking entropy and the radiation spectrums deviate from the purely thermal one, which is in accordance with the known result.

The action of the bosonic sector of the effective field theory induced by heterotic strings in four dimensions, which is relevant (for instance) to the study of dyons (Shapere et al. in Mod Phys Lett A6: 2677, 1991), is re-interpreted geometrically by using the new concept of ‘<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-Differentiation’. This extends the authors’ geometrical unification of the Einstein–Maxwell theory.
Black holes behave as thermodynamic systems, and a central task of any quantum theory of gravity is to explain these thermal properties. A statistical mechanical description of black hole entropy once seemed remote, but today we suffer an embarrassment of riches: despite counting very different states, many inequivalent approaches to quantum gravity obtain identical results. Such “universality” may reflect an underlying two-dimensional conformal symmetry near the horizon, which can be powerful enough to control the thermal characteristics independent of other details of the theory. This picture suggests an elegant description of the relevant degrees of freedom as Goldstone-boson-like excitations arising from symmetry breaking by the conformal anomaly.

Relativistic heavy ion collisions create a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. Some of the plasma’s properties can be approximately understood in terms of a dual black hole. These properties include shear viscosity, thermalization time, and drag force on heavy quarks. They are hard to calculate from first principles in QCD. Extracting predictions about quark-gluon plasmas from dual black holes mostly involves solving Einstein’s equations and classical string equations of motion. AdS/CFT provides a translation from gravitational calculations to gauge theory predictions. The gauge theory to which the predictions apply is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal {N}\)</span> = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory. QCD is different in many respects from super-Yang-Mills, but it seems that its high temperature properties are similar enough to make some meaningful comparisons.
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of certain black holes can be computed microscopically in string theory by mapping the elusive problem of counting microstates of a strongly gravitating black hole to the tractable problem of counting microstates of a weakly coupled D-brane system, which has no event horizon, and indeed comfortably fits on the head of a pin. We show here that, contrary to widely held beliefs, the entropy of spherically symmetric black holes can easily be dwarfed by that of stationary multi-black-hole “molecules” of the same total charge and energy. Thus, the corresponding pin-sized D-brane systems do not even approximately count the microstates of a single black hole, but rather those of a zoo of entropically dominant multicentered configurations.
We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current ΛCDM universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that observers in our “island universe” will be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe was first presented.
Cosmological black holes (CBH), i.e. black holes with masses of the order of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(10^{13}\div 10^{14} M_{\odot}\)</span> , have been proposed as possible progenitors of galaxy voids. The presence of a CBH in the central region of a void should induce significant gravitational lensing effects and in this paper we discuss such gravitational signatures using simulated data. These signatures may be summarized as follows: (1) a blind spot in the projected position of the CBH where no objects can be detected; (2) an excess of faint secondary images; (3) an excess of double images having a characteristic angular separation. All these signatures are shown to be detectable in future deep surveys.
The bending angle of light is a central quantity in the theory of gravitational lensing. We develop an analytical perturbation framework for calculating the bending angle of light rays lensed by a Schwarzschild black hole. Using a perturbation parameter given in terms of the gravitational radius of the black hole and the light ray’s impact parameter, we determine an invariant series for the strong-deflection bending angle that extends beyond the standard logarithmic deflection term used in the literature. In the process, we discovered an improvement to the standard logarithmic deflection term. Our perturbation framework is also used to derive as a consistency check, the recently found weak deflection bending angle series. We also reformulate the latter series in terms of a more natural invariant perturbation parameter, one that smoothly transitions between the weak and strong deflection series. We then compare our invariant strong deflection bending-angle series with the numerically integrated exact formal bending angle expression, and find less than 1% discrepancy for light rays as far out as twice the critical impact parameter. The paper concludes by showing that the strong and weak deflection bending angle series together provide an approximation that is within 1% of the exact bending angle value for light rays traversing anywhere between the photon sphere and infinity.
Experimental verification of the existence of gravimagnetic fields generated by currents of matter is important for a complete understanding and formulation of gravitational physics. Although the rotational (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic</em>) gravimagnetic field has been extensively studied and is now being measured by the Gravity Probe B, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extrinsic</em> gravimagnetic field generated by the translational current of matter is less well studied. The present paper uses the post-Newtonian parametrized Einstein and light geodesics equations to show that the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extrinsic</em> gravimagnetic field generated by the translational current of matter can be measured by observing the relativistic time delay and/or light deflection caused by the moving mass. We prove that the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extrinsic</em> gravimagnetic field is generated by the relativistic effect of the aberration of the gravity force caused by the Lorentz transformation of the metric tensor and the Levi–Civita connection. We show that the Lorentz transformation of the gravity field variables is equivalent to the technique of the retarded Lienard–Wiechert gravitational potentials predicting that a light particle is deflected by gravitational field of a moving body from its retarded position so that both general-relativistic phenomena—the aberration and the retardation of gravity—are tightly connected and observing the aberration of gravity proves that gravity has a causal nature. We explain in this framework the 2002 deflection experiment of a quasar by Jupiter where the aberration of gravity from its orbital motion was measured with accuracy 20%. We describe a theory of VLBI experiment to measure the gravitational deflection of radio waves from a quasar by the Sun, as viewed by a moving observer from the geocentric frame, to improve the measurement accuracy of the aberration of gravity to a few percent.
We exactly compute the finite <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> index and BPS partition functions for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{N}}=4\)</span> SYM theory in a newly proposed maximal angular momentum limit. The new limit is not predicted from the superconformal algebra, but naturally arises from the supergravity dual. We show that the index does not receive any finite <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> corrections while the free BPS partition function does.
In the framework of a class of metrics allowing for a timelike and a spacelike symmetries, usually referred to as stationary and axisymmetric gravitational fields, coupled to differentially rotating perfect fluids, the existing exact solutions to the corresponding Einstein equations are analyzed from the point of view of the fulfillment of the energy conditions and the existence of an axis of rotation. The main conclusion is that none of the reported exact solutions fulfills all these physical requirements, and at most, they can be thought of as stationary cyclic symmetric cosmological spacetimes.
A usual causal requirement on a viable theory of matter is that the speed of sound be at most the speed of light. In view of various recent papers querying this limit, the question is revisited here. We point to various issues confronting theories that violate the usual constraint.
We study gravitational radiation reaction in the equations of motion for binary systems with spin-orbit coupling, at order (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>)<sup>7</sup> beyond Newtonian gravity, or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>)<sup>2</sup> beyond the leading radiation reaction effects for non-spinning bodies. We use expressions for the energy and angular momentum flux at infinity that include spin-orbit corrections, together with an assumption of energy and angular momentum balance, to derive equations of motion that are valid for general orbits and for a class of coordinate gauges. We show that the equations of motion are compatible with those derived earlier by a direct calculation.
We study the evolution of an inhomogeneous fluid with self-similarity of the second kind and anisotropic pressure. We found a class of solution to the Einstein field equations by assuming an equation of state where the radial pressure of the fluid is proportional to its energy density (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p_r = \omega \rho\)</span>) and that the fluid moves along time-like geodesics. The equation of state combined with the self-similarity of second kind implies ω = −1. The energy conditions, geometrical and physical properties of the solutions are studied. We have found that, for the self-similar parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha=-\frac{1}{2}\)</span> , the solution represents an accelerated cosmological model ending in a Big Rip stage.
The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes suggested in Marolf and Ross (Class Quant Grav 20:4085, 2003), and modified later in Flores (Commun Math Phys 2007), is tested by computing the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is particularized for two important families of spacetimes, conformal to the previous ones: (standard) static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach essentially reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for multiple classical spacetimes: Reissner–Nordström (including Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.
We study the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for static quantum states on (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 1)-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric black holes. By solving the conservation equations, we are able to write the stress-energy tensor in terms of a single unknown function of the radial co-ordinate, plus two arbitrary constants. Conditions for the stress-energy tensor to be regular at event horizons (including the extremal and “ultra-extremal” cases) are then derived using generalized Kruskal-like co-ordinates. These results should be useful for future calculations of the RSET for static quantum states on spherically symmetric black hole geometries in any number of space-time dimensions.
Some historical documents, especially the Einstein–Besso manuscript from 1913, an extensive notebook by H. Thirring from 1917, and the correspondence between Thirring and Einstein in the year 1917 reveal that most of the merit for the so-called Lense-Thirring effect of general relativity belongs to Einstein. Besides telling this “central story” of the effect, we give a short “prehistory”, with contributions by E. Mach, B. and I. Friedlaender, and A. Föppl, followed by the later history of the problem of a correct centrifugal force inside a rotating mass shell, which was resolved only relatively recently.
In this paper we complete the integration of the conformally flat pure radiation spacetimes with a non-zero cosmological constant Λ, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\tau \ne 0\)</span> , by considering the case <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda +\tau\bar\tau \ne 0\)</span> . This is a further demonstration of the power and suitability of the generalised invariant formalism (GIF) for spacetimes where only one null direction is picked out by the Riemann tensor. For these spacetimes, the GIF picks out a second null direction (from the second derivative of the Riemann tensor) and once this spinor has been identified the calculations are transferred to the simpler GHP formalism, where the tetrad and metric are determined. The whole class of conformally flat pure radiation spacetimes with a non-zero cosmological constant (those found in this paper, together with those found earlier for the case <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda +\tau\bar\tau = 0\)</span>) have a rich variety of subclasses with zero, one, two, three, four or five Killing vectors.

In case of spacetimes with single horizon, there exist several well- established procedures for relating the surface gravity of the horizon to a thermodynamic temperature. Such procedures, however, cannot be extended in a straightforward manner when a spacetime has multiple horizons. In particular, it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using the example of Schwarzschild–De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor, response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational. (c) Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are discussed.
A detailed examination of the Killing equations in Robertson–Walker coordinates shows how the addition of matter and/or radiation to a de Sitter Universe breaks the symmetry generated by four of its Killing fields. The product <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(U = a^2 \,{\dot H}\)</span> of the squared scale parameter by the time-derivative of the Hubble function encapsulates the relationship between the two cases: the symmetry is maximal when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> is a constant, and reduces to the six-parameter symmetry of a generic Friedmann–Robertson–Walker model when it is not. As the fields physical interpretation is not clear in these coordinates, comparison is made with the Killing fields in static coordinates, whose interpretation is made clearer by their direct relationship to the Poincaré group generators via Wigner–Inönú contractions.
Caianiello’s derivation of Quantum Geometry through an isometric embedding of the spacetime (<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">M</strong>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>̃) in the pseudo-Riemannian structure (<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">T*M</strong>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>*<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AB</em> </sub>) is reconsidered. In the new derivation, using a non-linear connection and the bundle formalism, we obtain a Lorentzian-type structure in the 4-dimensional manifold <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">M</strong> that is covariant under arbitrary local coordinate transformations in <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">M</strong>. We obtain that if models with maximal acceleration are non-trivial, gravity should be supplied with other interactions in a unification framework.
Dynamical Einstein cluster is a spherical self-gravitating system of counterrotating particles, which may expand, oscillate and collapse. This system exhibits critical behaviour in its collapse at the threshold of black hole formation. It appears when the specific angular momentum of particles is tuned finely to the critical value. We find the unique exact self-similar solution at the threshold. This solution begins with a regular surface, involves timelike naked singularity formation and asymptotically approaches a static self-similar cluster.
We formulate quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) in the framework of locally covariant quantum field theory developed by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch, which is based on notions taken from category theory. This leads to a new viewpoint on the QEIs, and also to the identification of a new structural property of locally covariant quantum field theory, which we call local physical equivalence. Covariant formulations of the numerical range and spectrum of locally covariant fields are given and investigated, and a new algebra of fields is identified, in which fields are treated independently of their realisation on particular spacetimes and manifestly covariant versions of the functional calculus may be formulated.
We will pick up the concepts of partial and complete observables introduced by Rovelli in Conceptional Problems in Quantum Gravity, Birkhäuser, Boston (1991); Class Quant Grav, 8:1895 (1991); Phys Rev, D65:124013 (2002); Quantum Gravity, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2007) in order to construct Dirac observables in gauge systems. We will generalize these ideas to an arbitrary number of gauge degrees of freedom. Different methods to calculate such Dirac observables are developed. For background independent field theories we will show that partial and complete observables can be related to Kuchař’s Bubble-Time Formalism (J Math Phys, 13:768, 1972). Moreover one can define a non-trivial gauge action on the space of complete observables and also state the Poisson brackets of these functions. Additionally we will investigate, whether it is possible to calculate Dirac observables starting with partially invariant partial observables, for instance functions, which are invariant under the spatial diffeomorphism group.




We study a system of differential equations that governs the distribution of matter in the theory of General Relativity. The new element in this paper is the use of a dynamical action principle that includes all the degrees of freedom, matter as well as metric. The matter lagrangian defines a relativistic version of non-viscous, isentropic hydrodynamics. The matter fields are a scalar density and a velocity potential; the conventional, four-vector velocity field is replaced by the gradient of the potential and its scale is fixed by one of the Eulerian equations of motion, an innovation that significantly affects the imposition of boundary conditions. If the density is integrable at infinity, then the metric approaches the Schwarzschild metric at large distances. There are stars without boundary and with finite total mass; the metric shows rapid variation in the neighbourhood of the Schwarzschild radius and there is a very small core where a singularity indicates that the gas laws break down. For stars with boundary there emerges a new, critical relation between the radius and the gravitational mass, a consequence of the stronger boundary conditions. Tentative applications are suggested, to certain Red Giants, and to neutron stars, but the investigation reported here was limited to homogeneous polytropes. Comparison with the results of Oppenheimer and Volkoff on neutron cores shows a close agreement of numerical results. However, in the model the boundary of the star is fixed uniquely by the required matching of the interior metric to the external Schwarzschild metric, which is not the case in the traditional approach. There are solutions for which the metric is very close to the Schwarzshild metric everywhere outside the horizon, where the source is concentrated. The Schwarzschild metric is interpreted as the metric of an ideal, limiting configuration of matter, not as the metric of empty space.
The standard procedure for finding analytic perturbations in General Relativity suffers from the drawback that it is cumbersome to use beyond linear order perturbations. We present an alternate method of finding perturbations and provide an example in the form of a spherically symmetric over-dense region in an open Robertson–Walker background. The perturbation has several properties which are similar to those of a spiral galaxy.
The gravitational instability of a fully ionized gas is analyzed within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. In particular, the presence of a heat flux corresponding to generalized thermodynamic forces is shown to affect the properties of the dispersion relation governing the stability of this kind of system. The overall weight of the sole Dufour effect on the value of Jeans wavenumber is shown to be negligible.
This paper determines the travel time of a light ray connecting two points in the space-time solving numerically a two-point boundary value problem by means of the shooting method. For the resolution of this problem multiple precision floating-point arithmetic is required. We have studied distinct implementations of the shooting method attending to the way in which the Jacobian appearing at each iteration is approximated. We have shown that by using Magnus expansions to solve the differential equation for the Jacobian, one obtains a better efficiency of the shooting method. Also, a comparison between the numerical results obtained through the application of the shooting method and those derived by Le Poncin-Lafitte et al. (Class Quantum Grav, 21:4463-4483, 2004) from perturbative expansions of the world function is made.
The original Rainich theory for the non-null Einstein–Maxwell solutions consists of a set of algebraic conditions and the Rainich (differential) equation. We show here that the subclass of type D aligned solutions can be characterized just by algebraic restrictions.
In a recent study Noether symmetries of some static spacetime metrics in comparison with Killing vectors of corresponding spacetimes were studied. It was shown that Noether symmetries provide additional conservation laws that are not given by Killing vectors. In an attempt to understand how Noether symmetries compare with conformal Killing vectors, we find the Noether symmetries of the flat Friedmann cosmological model. We show that the conformally transformed flat Friedman model admits additional conservation laws not given by the Killing or conformal Killing vectors. Inter alia, these additional conserved quantities provide a mechanism to twice reduce the geodesic equations via the associated Noether symmetries.
We examine the effect on cosmological evolution of adding a Gauss–Bonnet term to the standard Einstein–Hilbert action for a (1 + 3) + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> dimensional Friedman–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric. By assuming that the additional dimensions compactify as a power law as the usual 3 spatial dimensions expand, we solve the resulting dynamical equations and find that the solution may be of either de Sitter or Kasner form depending upon whether the Gauss–Bonnet term or the Einstein term dominates.
We construct a large family of complete maximal surfaces in the static Robertson–Walker 3-spaces with negative base curvature. These examples provide a wide variety of non-standard foliations of such spaces by entire maximal graphs.
We find new classes of exact solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell system of equations for a charged sphere with a particular choice of the electric field intensity and one of the gravitational potentials. The condition of pressure isotropy is reduced to a linear, second order differential equation which can be solved in general. Consequently we can find exact solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell field equations corresponding to a static spherically symmetric gravitational potential in terms of hypergeometric functions. It is possible to find exact solutions which can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions, namely polynomials and product of polynomials and algebraic functions. Uncharged solutions are regainable with our choice of electric field intensity; in particular we generate the Einstein universe for particular parameter values.
The 3 + 1 GRMHD equations for Schwarzschild spacetime in Rindler coordinates with isothermal state of plasma are formulated. We consider the cases of non-rotating and rotating backgrounds with non-magnetized and magnetized plasmas. For these cases, the perturbed form of these equations are linearized and Fourier analyzed by introducing plane wave type solutions. The determinant of these equations in each case leads to two dispersion relations which give value of the wave number <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. Using the wave number, we obtain information like phase and group velocities etc. which help to discuss the nature of the waves and their characteristics. These provide interesting information about the black hole magnetosphere near the horizon. There are cases of normal and anomalous dispersion. We find a case of normal dispersion of waves when the plasma admits the properties of Veselago medium. Our results agree with those of Mackay et al. according to which rotation of a black hole is required for negative phase velocity propagation.
Penrose’s twistorial approach to the definition of angular momentum at null infinity is developed so that angular momenta at different cuts can be meaningfully compared. This is done by showing that the twistor spaces associated with different cuts of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal{J}^+\)</span> can be identified as manifolds (but not as vector spaces). The result is a well-defined, Bondi–Metzner–Sachs-invariant notion of angular momentum in a radiating space–time; the difficulties and ambiguities previously encountered are attached to attempts to express this in special-relativistic terms, and in particular to attempts to identify a single Minkowski space of origins. Unlike the special-relativistic case, the angular momentum cannot be represented by a purely <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> =  1 quantity <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>, but has higher-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> contributions as well. Applying standard kinematic prescriptions, these higher-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> contributions are shown to correspond precisely to the shear. Thus it appears that shear and angular momentum should be regarded as different aspects of a single unified concept.
A new parametrization of the 3-metric allows to find explicitly a York map by means of a partial Shanmugadhasan canonical transformation in canonical ADM tetrad gravity. This allows to identify the two pairs of physical tidal degrees of freedom (the Dirac observables of the gravitational field have to be built in term of them) and 14 gauge variables. These gauge quantities, whose role in describing generalized inertial effects is clarified, are all configurational except one, the York time, i.e. the trace <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(^{3}K(\tau ,\vec \sigma )\)</span> of the extrinsic curvature of the instantaneous 3-spaces <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Sigma_{\tau}\)</span> (corresponding to a clock synchronization convention) of a non-inertial frame centered on an arbitrary observer. In <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Sigma_{\tau}\)</span> the Dirac Hamiltonian is the sum of the weak ADM energy <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(E_{\rm ADM} = \int d^3\sigma\, {\mathcal{E}}_{\rm ADM}(\tau ,\vec \sigma )\)</span> (whose density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\mathcal{E}}_{\rm ADM}(\tau ,\vec \sigma )\)</span> is coordinate-dependent, containing the inertial potentials) and of the first-class constraints. The main results of the paper, deriving from a coherent use of constraint theory, are: (i) The explicit form of the Hamilton equations for the two tidal degrees of freedom of the gravitational field in an arbitrary gauge: a deterministic evolution can be defined only in a completely fixed gauge, i.e. in a non-inertial frame with its pattern of inertial forces. The simplest such gauge is the 3-orthogonal one, but other gauges are discussed and the Hamiltonian interpretation of the harmonic gauges is given. This frame-dependence derives from the geometrical view of the gravitational field and is lost when the theory is reduced to a linear spin 2 field on a background space-time. (ii) A general solution of the super-momentum constraints, which shows the existence of a generalized Gribov ambiguity associated to the 3-diffeomorphism gauge group. It influences: (a) the explicit form of the solution of the super-momentum constraint and then of the Dirac Hamiltonian; (b) the determination of the shift functions and then of the lapse one. (iii) The dependence of the Hamilton equations for the two pairs of dynamical gravitational degrees of freedom (the generalized tidal effects) and for the matter, written in a completely fixed 3-orthogonal Schwinger time gauge, upon the gauge variable <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\({}^3K(\tau ,\vec \sigma )\)</span> , determining the convention of clock synchronization. The associated relativistic inertial effects, absent in Newtonian gravity and implying inertial forces changing from attractive to repulsive in regions with different sign of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\({}^3K(\tau ,\vec \sigma )\)</span> , are completely unexplored and may have astrophysical relevance in the interpretation of the dark side of the universe.

We obtain the static spherically symmetric solutions of a class of gravitational models whose additions to the General Relativity (GR) action forbid Ricci-flat, in particular, Schwarzschild geometries. These theories are selected to maintain the (first) derivative order of the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild gauge. Generically, the solutions exhibit both horizons and a singularity at the origin, except for one model that forbids spherical symmetry altogether. Extensions to arbitrary dimension with a cosmological constant, Maxwell source and Gauss-Bonnet terms are also considered.
We prove a theorem that characterizes a large family of non-static solutions to Einstein equations in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-dimensional space-time, representing, in general, spherically symmetric Type II fluid. It is shown that the best known Vaidya-based (radiating) black hole solutions to Einstein equations, in both four dimensions (4D) and higher dimensions (HD), are particular cases from this family. The spherically symmetric static black hole solutions for Type I fluid can also be retrieved. A brief discussion on the energy conditions, singularities and horizons is provided.
Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) as a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation, have been appeared in alternative approaches to quantum gravity problem. Loop quantum gravity is one of these approaches which evidently contains modification of dispersion relations. These MDRs will affect the usual formulation of the Compton effect. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the effects of loop quantum gravity MDRs on the formulation of Compton scattering. Using limitations imposed on MDRs parameters from ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR), we estimate the quantum gravity-induced wavelength shift of scattered photons in a typical Compton process. Possible experimental detection of this wavelength shift will provide strong support for underlying quantum gravity proposal.
A hydrodynamic model of the Weyl–Dirac theory in the non-relativistic approach is established. Any microparticle is permanently interacting with the ‘subquantum level’ through the quantum potential, which depends only on the imaginary part of a complex speed. The complex speed fields indicate a possible connection between the Weyl–Dirac theory and Scale Relativity Theory. In such conjecture, some properties of the vacuum states result: the vacuum states behave as a superconducting state, they act as an energy accumulator etc.
A short electromagnetic wavelength approximation is used to obtain general solutions to the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic radiation in a Kerr–Schild plane gravitational wave metric. Their properties are then investigated for the specific case of a light beam in a weak, harmonic gravitational wave.
In order to study the mass generation of the vector fields in the framework of a conformal invariant gravitational model, the Weyl–Dirac theory is considered. The mass of the Weyl’s meson fields plays a principal role in this theory, it connects basically the conformal and gauge symmetries. We estimate this mass by using the large-scale characteristics of the observed universe. To do this we firstly specify a preferred conformal frame as a cosmological frame, then in this frame, we introduce an exact possible solution of the theory. We also study the dynamical effect of the massive vector meson fields on the trajectories of an elementary particle. We show that a local change of the cosmological frame leads to a Hamilton–Jacobi equation describing a particle with an adjustable mass. The dynamical effect of the massive vector meson field presents itself in the form of a correction term for the mass of the particle.
We study interacting scalar field theory non-minimally coupled to gravity in the FRW background. We show that for a specific choice of interaction terms, the energy–momentum tensor of the scalar field ϕ vanishes, and as a result the scalar field does not gravitate. The naive space dependent solution to equations of motion gives rise to singular field profile. We carefully analyze the energy–momentum tensor for such a solution and show that the singularity of the solution gives a subtle contribution to the energy–momentum tensor. The space dependent solution therefore is not non-gravitating. Our conclusion is applicable to other space–time dependent non-gravitating solutions as well. We study hybrid inflation scenario in this model when purely time dependent non-gravitating field is coupled to another scalar field χ.
For the quintom models with arbitrary potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V=V(\varphi, \sigma)\)</span> , the asymptotic value of equation of state parameter ω is obtained by a new method. In this method, ω of stable attractors are calculated by using the ratio d ln <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> ln <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> in asymptotic region. All the known results, have been obtained by other methods, are reproduced by this method as specific examples.
We investigate, in the context of five-dimensional (5D) Brans–Dicke theory of gravity, the idea that macroscopic matter configurations can be generated from pure vacuum in five dimensions, an approach first proposed by Wesson and collaborators in the framework of 5D general relativity. We show that the 5D Brans–Dicke vacuum equations when reduced to four dimensions (4D) lead to a modified version of Brans–Dicke theory in 4D. As an application of the formalism, we obtain two 5D extensions of 4D O’Hanlon and Tupper vacuum solution and show that they lead two different cosmological scenarios in 4D.
The propagation of photons in the magnetoplasma medium of pulsar magnetosphere is studied in the framework of an effective metric theory. It is found that the surface redshift is induced by two factors: one coming from the gravitational field and another from the magnetoplasma. The magnetoplasma can shift the spectrum, and the modification of surface redshift of pulsars due to associated magnetoplasma can be the same extent as the gravitational redshift in particular cases via calculation.
The present matter density of the Universe, while highly inhomogeneous on small scales, displays approximate homogeneity on large scales. We propose that whereas it is justified to use the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) line element (which describes an exactly homogeneous and isotropic universe) as a template to construct luminosity distances in order to compare observations with theory, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">evolution</em> of the scale factor in such a construction must be governed not by the standard Einstein equations for the FLRW metric, but by the modified Friedmann equations derived by Buchert (Gen Relat Gravit 32:105, 2000; 33:1381, 2001) in the context of spatial averaging in Cosmology. Furthermore, we argue that this scale factor, defined in the spatially averaged cosmology, will correspond to the effective FLRW metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">provided</em> the size of the averaging domain coincides with the scale at which cosmological homogeneity arises. This allows us, in principle, to compare predictions of a spatially averaged cosmology with observations, in the standard manner, for instance by computing the luminosity distance versus red-shift relation. The predictions of the spatially averaged cosmology would in general differ from standard FLRW cosmology, because the scale-factor now obeys the modified FLRW equations. This could help determine, by comparing with observations, whether or not cosmological inhomogeneities are an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.
Several interesting astrophysical phenomena are symmetric with respect to the rotation axis, like the head-on collision of compact bodies, the collapse and/or accretion of fields with a large variety of geometries, or some forms of gravitational waves. Most current numerical relativity codes, however, cannot take advantage of these symmetries due to the fact that singularities in the adapted coordinates, either at the origin or at the axis of symmetry, rapidly cause the simulation to crash. Because of this regularity problem it has become common practice to use full-blown Cartesian three-dimensional codes to simulate axi-symmetric systems. In this work we follow a recent idea of Rinne and Stewart and present a simple procedure to regularize the equations both in spherical and axi-symmetric spaces. We explicitly show the regularity of the evolution equations, describe the corresponding numerical code, and present several examples clearly showing the regularity of our evolutions.
The direct detection of gravitational waves will provide valuable astrophysical information about many celestial objects. Also, it will be an important test to general relativity and other theories of gravitation. The gravitational wave detector SCHENBERG has recently undergone its first test run. It is expected to have its first scientific run soon. In this work the data analysis system of this spherical, resonant mass detector is tested through the simulation of the detection of gravitational waves generated during the inspiralling phase of a binary system. It is shown from the simulated data that it is not necessary to have all six transducers operational in order to determine the source’s direction and the wave’s amplitudes.
We present an exact solution of Einstein’s equations representing interpenetrating clouds of rotating dust. The solution is a member of the van Stockum class; it contains singularities at the centres of the clouds. These are sources of the angular momentum which is displayed by the metric at infinity. It is not clear whether the rotating dust contributes to the angular momentum. In the case of two clouds there is a conical singularity between the central ones. For three clouds the conical singularity may be absent.
An elementary notion of gauge equivalence is introduced that does not require any Lagrangian or Hamiltonian apparatus. It is shown that in the special case of theories, such as general relativity, whose symmetries can be identified with spacetime diffeomorphisms this elementary notion has many of the same features as the usual notion. In particular, it performs well in the presence of asymptotic boundary conditions.


The extreme luminosity and their fairly unique temporal behaviour have made supernovae a superb tool to measure distances in the universe. As complex astrophysical events they provide interesting insights into explosion physics, explosive nucleosynthesis, hydrodynamics of the explosion and radiation transport. They are an end product of stellar evolution and provide clues to the stellar composition. Since they can be observed at large distances they have become critical probes to further explore astrophysical effects, like dust properties in external galaxies and the star formation history of galaxies. Some of the astrophysics interferes with the cosmological applications of supernovae. The local velocity field, distorted by the gravitational attraction of the local large scale structure, and the reddening law appear at the moment the major limitations in the accuracy with which cosmological parameters can be determined. These absorption effects can introduce a secondary bias into the observations of the distant supernovae, which needs to be carefully evaluated. Supernovae have been used for the measurement of the Hubble constant, i.e. the current expansion rate of the universe, and the accelerated cosmic expansion directly inferred from the apparent faintness of the distant supernovae.
In this review, I outline the use of galaxy correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. As with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the density of dark and baryonic matter imprints important scales on the fluctuations of matter and thus the clustering of galaxies, e.g., the particle horizon at matter-radiation equality and the sound horizon at recombination. Precision measurements of these scales from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the large scale shape of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering provide constraints on Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> <sup>2</sup>. Recent measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) strongly suggest that Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> &lt; 0.3. This forms the basic evidence for a flat Universe dominated by a Cosmological Constant (Λ) today (when combined with results from the CMB and supernova surveys). Further evidence for this cosmological model is provided by the late-time Integrated Sachs–Wolfe (ISW) effect, which has now been detected using a variety of tracers of the large scale structure in the Universe out to redshifts of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> &gt; 1. The ISW effect also provides an opportunity to discriminate between Λ, dynamical dark energy models and the modification of gravity on large scales.
Several kinds of astronomical observations, interpreted in the framework of the standard Friedmann–Robertson–Walker cosmology, have indicated that our universe is dominated by a Cosmological Constant. The dimming of distant Type Ia supernovae suggests that the expansion rate is accelerating, as if driven by vacuum energy, and this has been indirectly substantiated through studies of angular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of spatial correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies. However there is no compelling <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">direct</em> evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy. The precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the Hubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value. The LSS data can also be satisfactorily fitted if there is a small component of hot dark matter, as would be provided by neutrinos of mass ∼0.5 eV. Although such an Einstein–de Sitter model cannot explain the SNe Ia Hubble diagram or the position of the “baryon acoustic oscillation” peak in the autocorrelation function of galaxies, it may be possible to do so, e.g. in an inhomogeneous Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi cosmology where we are located in a void which is expanding faster than the average. Such alternatives may seem contrived but this must be weighed against our lack of any fundamental understanding of the inferred tiny energy scale of the dark energy. It may well be an artifact of an oversimplified cosmological model, rather than having physical reality.
We discuss degeneracies between dark energy and cosmic parameters using a fully non-perturbative and non-parametric approach. This allows us to examine the knock-on bias induced in the reconstructed dark energy equation of state, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>), if there is a bias in the cosmic curvature or dark matter content. Assuming perfect Hubble, distance and volume measurements, we show that for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>  &gt;  1, the bias in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>) is up to two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding errors in Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> </sub> or Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub>.
Observations provide increasingly strong evidence that the universe is accelerating. This revolutionary advance in cosmological observations confronts theoretical cosmology with a tremendous challenge, which it has so far failed to meet. Explanations of cosmic acceleration within the framework of general relativity are plagued by difficulties. General relativistic models are nearly all based on a dark energy field with fine-tuned, unnatural properties. There is a great variety of models, but all share one feature in common—an inability to account for the gravitational properties of the vacuum energy. Speculative ideas from string theory may hold some promise, but it is fair to say that no convincing model has yet been proposed. An alternative to dark energy is that gravity itself may behave differently from general relativity on the largest scales, in such a way as to produce acceleration. The alternative approach of modified gravity (or dark gravity) provides a new angle on the problem, but also faces serious difficulties, including in all known cases severe fine-tuning and the problem of explaining why the vacuum energy does not gravitate. The lack of an adequate theoretical framework for the late-time acceleration of the universe represents a deep crisis for theory—but also an exciting challenge for theorists. It seems likely that an entirely new paradigm is required to resolve this crisis.
Quintessence theories for cosmic acceleration imbue dark energy with a non-trivial dynamics that offers hope in distinguishing the physical origin of this component. We review quintessence models with an emphasis on the dynamics and discuss classifications of the different physical behaviors. The pros and cons of various parameterizations are examined as well as the extension from scalar fields to other modifications of the Friedmann expansion equation. New results on the ability of cosmological data to distinguish among and between thawing and freezing fields are presented.
Astrophysical observations are pointing out huge amounts of “dark matter” and “dark energy” needed to explain the observed large scale structure and cosmic dynamics. The emerging picture is a spatially flat, homogeneous Universe undergoing the today observed accelerated phase. Despite of the good quality of astrophysical surveys, commonly addressed as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Precision Cosmology</em>, the nature and the nurture of dark energy and dark matter, which should constitute the bulk of cosmological matter-energy, are still unknown. Furthermore, up to now, no experimental evidence has been found, at fundamental level, to explain such mysterious components. The problem could be completely reversed considering dark matter and dark energy as “shortcomings” of General Relativity in its simplest formulation (a linear theory in the Ricci scalar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, minimally coupled to the standard perfect fluid matter) and claiming for the “correct” theory of gravity as that derived by matching the largest number of observational data, without imposing any theory a priori. As a working hypothesis, accelerating behavior of cosmic fluid, large scale structure, potential of galaxy clusters, rotation curves of spiral galaxies could be reproduced by means of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extending</em> the standard theory of General Relativity. In other words, gravity could acts in different ways at different scales and the above “shortcomings” could be due to incorrect extrapolations of the Einstein gravity, actually tested at short scales and low energy regimes. After a survey of what is intended for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Extended Theories of Gravity</em> in the so called “metric” and “Palatini” approaches, we discuss some cosmological and astrophysical applications where the issues related to the dark components are addressed by enlarging the Einstein theory to more general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f </em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) Lagrangians, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f </em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) is a generic function of Ricci scalar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, not assumed simply linear. Obviously, this is not the final answer to the problem of “dark-components” but it can be considered as an operative scheme whose aim is to avoid the addition of unknown exotic ingredients to the cosmic pie.
We review recent attempts to address the cosmological constant problem and the late-time acceleration of the Universe based on braneworld models. In braneworld models, the way in which the vacuum energy gravitates in the 4D spacetime is radically different from conventional 4D physics. It is possible that the vacuum energy on a brane does not curve the 4D spacetime and only affects the geometry of the extra-dimensions, offering a solution to the cosmological constant problem. We review the idea of supersymmetric large extra dimensions that could achieve this and also provide a natural candidate for a quintessence field. We also review the attempts to explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe from the large-distance modification of gravity based on the braneworld. We use the Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati model to demonstrate how one can distinguish this model from dark energy models in 4D general relativity. Theoretical difficulties in this approach are also addressed.
I discuss the spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) metric, which provides an exact toy model for an inhomogeneous universe. Since we observe light rays from the past light cone, not the expansion of the universe, spatial variation in matter density and Hubble rate can have the same effect on redshift as acceleration in a perfectly homogeneous universe. As a consequence, a simple spatial variation in the Hubble rate can account for the distant supernova data in a dust universe without any dark energy. I also review various attempts towards a semirealistic description of the universe based on the LTB model.
The effective evolution of an inhomogeneous universe model in any theory of gravitation may be described in terms of spatially averaged variables. In Einstein’s theory, restricting attention to scalar variables, this evolution can be modeled by solutions of a set of Friedmann equations for an effective volume scale factor, with matter and backreaction source terms. The latter can be represented by an effective scalar field (“morphon field”) modeling Dark Energy. The present work provides an overview over the Dark Energy debate in connection with the impact of inhomogeneities, and formulates strategies for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of backreaction effects both in theoretical and observational cosmology. We recall the basic steps of a description of backreaction effects in relativistic cosmology that lead to refurnishing the standard cosmological equations, but also lay down a number of challenges and unresolved issues in connection with their observational interpretation. The present status of this subject is intermediate: we have a good qualitative understanding of backreaction effects pointing to a global instability of the standard model of cosmology; exact solutions and perturbative results modeling this instability lie in the right sector to explain Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. It is fair to say that, even if backreaction effects turn out to be less important than anticipated by some researchers, the concordance high-precision cosmology, the architecture of current N-body simulations, as well as standard perturbative approaches may all fall short in correctly describing the Late Universe.
I review the problem of dark energy focussing on cosmological constant as the candidate and discuss what it tells us regarding the nature of gravity. Section 1 briefly overviews the currently popular “concordance cosmology” and summarizes the evidence for dark energy. It also provides the observational and theoretical arguments in favour of the cosmological constant as a candidate and emphasizes why no other approach really solves the conceptual problems usually attributed to cosmological constant. Section 2 describes some of the approaches to understand the nature of the cosmological constant and attempts to extract certain key ingredients which must be present in any viable solution. In the conventional approach, the equations of motion for matter fields are invariant under the shift of the matter Lagrangian by a constant while gravity breaks this symmetry. I argue that until the gravity is made to respect this symmetry, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution to the cosmological constant problem. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hence cosmological constant problem essentially has to do with our understanding of the nature of gravity</em>. Section 3 discusses such an alternative perspective on gravity in which the gravitational interaction—described in terms of a metric on a smooth spacetime—is an emergent, long wavelength phenomenon, and can be described in terms of an effective theory using an action associated with normalized vectors in the spacetime. This action is explicitly invariant under the shift of the matter energy momentum tensor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub>→ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ab</em> </sub> + Λ <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gab</em> </sub> and any bulk cosmological constant can be gauged away. Extremizing this action leads to an equation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">determining the background geometry</em> which gives Einstein’s theory at the lowest order with Lanczos–Lovelock type corrections. In this approach, the observed value of the cosmological constant has to arise from the energy fluctuations of degrees of freedom located in the boundary of a spacetime region.
We give an overview of the status of string cosmology. We explain the motivation for the subject, outline the main problems, and assess some of the proposed solutions. Our focus is on those aspects of cosmology that benefit from the data of an ultraviolet-complete theory.
The energy density of the vacuum, Λ, is at least 60 orders of magnitude smaller than several known contributions to it. Approaches to this problem are tightly constrained by data ranging from elementary observations to precision experiments. Absent overwhelming evidence to the contrary, dark energy can only be interpreted as vacuum energy, so the venerable assumption that Λ = 0 conflicts with observation. The possibility remains that Λ is fundamentally variable, though constant over large spacetime regions. This can explain the observed value, but only in a theory satisfying a number of restrictive kinematic and dynamical conditions. String theory offers a concrete realization through its landscape of metastable vacua.
While observational cosmology has recently progressed fast, it revealed a serious dilemma called dark energy: an unknown source of exotic energy with negative pressure driving a current accelerating phase of the universe. All attempts so far to find a convincing theoretical explanation have failed, so that one of the last hopes is the yet to be developed quantum theory of gravity. In this article, loop quantum gravity is considered as a candidate, with an emphasis on properties which might play a role for the dark energy problem. Its basic feature is the discrete structure of space, often associated with quantum theories of gravity on general grounds. This gives rise to well-defined matter Hamiltonian operators and thus sheds light on conceptual questions related to the cosmological constant problem. It also implies typical quantum geometry effects which, from a more phenomenological point of view, may result in dark energy. In particular the latter scenario allows several non-trivial tests which can be made more precise by detailed observations in combination with a quantitative study of numerical quantum gravity. If the speculative possibility of a loop quantum gravitational origin of dark energy turns out to be realized, a program as outlined here will help to hammer out our ideas for a quantum theory of gravity, and at the same time allow predictions for the distant future of our universe.
The quantum theory of a harmonic oscillator with a time dependent frequency arises in several important physical problems, especially in the study of quantum field theory in an external background. While the mathematics of this system is straightforward, several conceptual issues arise in such a study. We present a general formalism to address some of the conceptual issues like the emergence of classicality, definition of particle content, back reaction etc. In particular, we parameterize the wave function in terms of a complex number (which we call excitation parameter) and express all physically relevant quantities in terms it. Many of the notions—like those of particle number density, effective Lagrangian etc., which are usually defined using asymptotic in–out states—are generalized as time-dependent concepts and we show that these generalized definitions lead to useful and reasonable results. Having developed the general formalism we apply it to several examples. Exact analytic expressions are found for a particular toy model and approximate analytic solutions are obtained in the extreme cases of adiabatic and highly non-adiabatic evolution. We then work out the exact results numerically for a variety of models and compare them with the analytic results and approximations. The formalism is useful in addressing the question of emergence of classicality of the quantum state, its relation to particle production and to clarify several conceptual issues related to this. In Paper II which is a sequel to this, the formalism will be applied to analyze the corresponding issues in the context of quantum field theory in background cosmological models and electric fields.
We adopt the general formalism, which was developed in Paper I to analyze the evolution of a quantized time-dependent oscillator, to address several questions in the context of quantum field theory in time dependent external backgrounds. In particular, we study the question of emergence of classicality in terms of the phase space evolution and its relation to particle production, and clarify some conceptual issues. We consider a quantized scalar field evolving in a constant electric field and in FRW spacetimes which illustrate the two extreme cases of late time adiabatic and highly non-adiabatic evolution. Using the time-dependent generalizations of various quantities like particle number density, effective Lagrangian etc. introduced in Paper I, we contrast the evolution in these two limits bringing out key differences between the Schwinger effect and evolution in the de Sitter background. Further, our examples suggest that the notion of classicality is multifaceted and any one single criterion may not have universal applicability. For example, the peaking of the phase space Wigner distribution on the classical trajectory <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">alone</em> does not imply transition to classical behavior. An analysis of the behavior of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">classicality parameter</em>, which was introduced in Paper I, leads to the conclusion that strong particle production is necessary for the quantum state to become highly correlated in phase space at late times.
We investigate exact solution in higher dimensional Husain model for a null fluid source with pressure <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and density ρ are related by the following relations (i) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>  =  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>ρ, (ii) <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p = k\rho - \frac{B(v)}{\rho^{\alpha}}\)</span> (variable modified Chaplygin) and (iii) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>  =  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>ρ<sup>α</sup> (polytropic). We have studied the nature of singularity in gravitational collapse for the above equations of state and also for different choices of the of the parameters <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> namely, (i) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>  =  0, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>  =  constant (generalized Chaplygin), (ii) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>  =  constant (modified Chaplygin). It is found that the nature of singularity is independent of these choices of different equation of state except for variable Chaplygin model. Choices of various parameters are shown in tabular form. Finally, matching of Szekeres model with exterior Husain space–time is done.
In this work we give special attention to the bimetric theory of gravitation with massive gravitons proposed by Visser in 1998. In his theory, a prior background metric is necessary to take in account the massive term. Although in the great part of the astrophysical studies the Minkowski metric is the best choice to the background metric, it is not possible to consider this metric in cosmology. In order to keep the Minkowski metric as background in this case, we suggest an interpretation of the energy–momentum conservation in Visser’s theory, which is in accordance with the equivalence principle and recovers naturally the special relativity in the absence of gravitational sources. Although we do not present a general proof of our hypothesis we show its validity in the simple case of a plane and dust-dominated universe, in which the “massive term” appears like an extra contribution for the energy density.
The Bousso entropy bound is investigated in a static spherically symmetric spacetime filled with an ideal gas of massless bosons or fermions. Especially lightsheets generated by spheres are considered. A statistical description of the gas is given. Conditions under which the Bousso bound can be violated are discussed and it is shown that a possible violating region cannot be arbitrarily large and that it is contained inside a sphere of unit Planck radius if the number of independent polarization states <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> is small enough. It is also shown that the central temperature must exceed the Planck temperature in order to get a violation of the Bousso bound for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> </sub> not too large.
The viability of two different classes of Λ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>)CDM cosmologies is tested by using the APM 08279+5255, an old quasar at redshift <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 3.91. In the first class of models, the cosmological term scales as Λ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) ~ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup>. The particular case <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 0 describes the standard ΛCDM model whereas <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 2 stands for the Chen and Wu model. For an estimated age of 2 Gyr, it is found that the power index has a lower limit <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &gt; 0.21, whereas for 3 Gyr the limit is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &gt; 0.6. Since <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> can not be so large as ~ 0.81, the ΛCDM and Chen and Wu models are also ruled out by this analysis. The second class of models is the one recently proposed by Wang and Meng which describes several Λ(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>)CDM cosmologies discussed in the literature. By assuming that the true age is 2 Gyr it is found that the ε parameter satisfies the lower bound <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\epsilon &gt; 0.11\)</span> , while for 3 Gyr, a lower limit of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\epsilon &gt; 0.52\)</span> is obtained. Such limits are slightly modified when the baryonic component is included.
We construct a physical model to study the effects of dimensional reduction that might have taken place during the inflationary phase of the universe. The model we propose is a (1 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>)-dimensional (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> &gt; 3), nonsingular, spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann model. We consider dimensional reduction to take place in a stepwise manner and interpret each step as a phase transition. Independent of the details of the process of dimensional reduction, we impose suitable boundary conditions across the transitions and trace the effects of dimensional reduction to the currently observable parameters of the universe. In order to exhibit the cosmological features of the proposed model, we construct a (1 + 4)-dimensional toy model for both closed and open cases of Friedmann geometries. It is shown that in these models the universe makes transition into the lower dimension when the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">critical length</em> parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> <sub>4,3</sub>, which signals dimensional reduction, reaches the Planck length in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 3. The numerical models we present in this paper have the capability of making definite predictions about the cosmological parameters of the universe such as the Hubble parameter, age and density.
We find exact solutions in 5D inhomogeneous matter dominated model with a varying cosmological constant. Adjusting arbitrary constants of integration one can also achieve acceleration in our model. Aside from an initial singularity our spacetime is regular everywhere including the centre of the inhomogeneous distribution. We also study the analogous homogeneous universe in (4 + d) dimensions. Here an initially decelerating model is found to give late acceleration in conformity with the current observational demands. We also find that both anisotropy and number of dimensions have a role to play in determining the time of flip, in fact the flip is delayed in multidimensional models. Some astrophysical parameters like the age, luminosity distance, etc., are also calculated and the influence of extra dimensions is briefly discussed. Interestingly our model yields a larger age of the universe compared to many other quintessential models.
Based on the anomaly cancellation method, initiated by Robinson and Wilczek, we investigate Hawking radiation from the event horizon and cosmological horizon of the higher dimensional Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter black hole via covariant gauge and gravitational anomalies. Unlike in black hole space-time, to describe the observable physics, the effective field theory here is constructed between the event horizon and cosmological horizon. Our result shows that to restore the underlying gauge covariance and diffeomorphism covariance at the quantum level, the covariant compensating fluxes of gauge and energy–momentum tensor, which are shown to equal to those of Hawking radiation, should be radiated from the event horizon and absorbed from the cosmological horizon, respectively.
The seminal paper by Kasner (Am. J. Math. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">43</strong>, 217–221, 1921) is reprinted here, together with an editorial comment on its lasting scientific relevance, and a biography of the author.


Precision clocks and interferometers in space can test relativistic gravity with extremely high sensitivity. Yet, only a single such test has been performed, namely the celebrated flight of a hydrogen maser in a sub-orbital trajectory in 1976 (GP-A mission). This paper suggests some of the obstacles to space flight of precision instruments, and describes how the emergence of new technology might offer a pathway for removing those obstacles. A brief review of emerging technologies is made, and new mission concepts based on them are described. Some of the technologies that can impact more tests of relativistic gravity in space at a more distant future are also described.
The angular momentum of the Earth produces gravitomagnetic components of the Riemann curvature tensor, which are of the order of 10<sup>−10</sup> of the Newtonian terms arising from the mass of the Earth. Due to the dragging of the local inertial frame by the spinning Earth, there are also secular terms, which grow in time. These fields can be detected in principle by a set of orbiting superconducting gravity gradiometers. The Riemann tensor components for various spacecraft orientations have been computed and the principle of detecting the gravitomagnetic tidal force has been published. In this paper, we review the conclusions of the earlier analyses and discuss the feasibility of the gravity gradiometer experiment.
In 1979 we observed the quantum mechanical phase shift of neutron deBroglie waves due to the Earth’s rotation. After the result was published, a number of very nice theoretical papers on the experiment appeared. I have two favorites: The one by M. Dresden and C. N. Yang in which they view the effect as due to the Doppler shift created by reflection from moving mirrors; and the other one by J. J. Sakurai in which he views the origin of the effect as being due to a flux of rotation threading the neutron interferometer loop, in much the same way that magnetic flux threads the electron interferometer loop to create the topological Aharonov-Bohm effect. Here, I would like to place their explanations of the physics of this experiment in juxtaposition with my own understanding of it.
Large ring lasers with a cavity Q well above 10<sup>12</sup> are characterized by extremely narrow line-widths and high coherence. At this point, active Sagnac interferometers do not quite reach the quantum limit. In this paper, we will explore the current status of this technology and look at the various noise processes involved with large ring lasers rigidly mounted to the Earth crust.
We review the main results obtained in the literature on quasi-normal modes (QNM) of compact stars and black holes, in the light of recent exciting developments of gravitational wave (GW) detectors. QNMs are a fundamental feature of the gravitational signal emitted by compact objects in many astrophysical processes; we will show that their eigenfrequencies encode interesting information on the nature and on the inner structure of the emitting source and we will discuss whether we are ready for a GW asteroseismology.
The thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of Weinhold’s and Ruppeiner’s thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the Reissner–Nordström black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its phase transition structure.
Three natural classes of orthonormal frames, namely Frenet-Serret, Fermi–Walker and parallel transported frames, exist along any timelike world line in spacetime. Their relationships are investigated for timelike circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, and illustrated for black hole spacetimes.
A theory is derived relating the configuration of the cores of active galaxies, specifically candidates for presumed super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), to time-dependent changes in images of those galaxies. Three deflection quantities, resulting from the monopole term, mass quadrupole term, and spin dipole term of the core, are examined. The resulting observational technique is applied to the galaxy 3C66B. This technique is found to under idealized circumstances surpass the technique proposed by Jenet et al. in accuracy for constraining the mass of SMBHB candidates, but is exceeded in accuracy and precision by Jenet’s technique under currently understood likely conditions. The technique can also under favorable circumstances produce results measurable by currently available astronomical interferometry such as very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI).
The standard text-book Jacobi equation (equation of geodesic deviation) arises by linearizing the geodesic equation around some chosen geodesic, where the linearization is done with respect to the coordinates and the velocities. The generalized Jacobi equation, introduced by Hodgkinson in 1972 and further developed by Mashhoon and others, arises if the linearization is done only with respect to the coordinates, but not with respect to the velocities. The resulting equation has been studied by several authors in some detail for timelike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. Here we begin by briefly considering the generalized Jacobi equation on affine manifolds, without a metric; then we specify to lightlike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. We illustrate the latter case by considering particular lightlike geodesics (a) in Schwarzschild spacetime and (b) in a plane-wave spacetime.
We present a new model universe based on the junction of FRW to flat Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) solutions of Einstein equations along our past light cone, bringing structures within the FRW models. The model is assumed globally to be homogeneous, i.e. the cosmological principle is valid. Local inhomogeneities within the past light cone are modeled as a flat LTB, whereas those outside the light cone are assumed to be smoothed out and represented by a FRW model. The model is singularity free, always FRW far from the observer along the past light cone, gives way to a different luminosity distance relation as for the CDM/FRW models, a negative deceleration parameter near the observer, and correct linear and non-linear density contrast. As a whole, the model behaves like a FRW model on the past light cone with a special behavior of the scale factor, Hubble and deceleration parameter, mimicking dark energy.
In their origins Einstein’s studies of relativity principles called into question the validity of important assumptions that had previously been made in formulating physical theories, assumptions made without investigation into alternatives. Examples of this include notions of absolute time and space, flat Euclidean geometry, and trivial topology. In this paper, we review an intermediate niche, differentiable (smooth) structure, which must be defined between topology and geometry. We now know that this choice need not be trivial. Just as it seemed for centuries to be obvious that space should be flat, so it would seem until recently that standard, trivial, smoothness for spacetime is the only choice. We now know that this is not true. In this paper we review these topics in the light of very surprising and often counter-intuitive mathematical discoveries of the last 20 years or so. Since our regions of observability are necessarily constrained we do not have any a priori justification for extending standard smoothness globally. This opens up the possibility of non-standard extension of solutions to field equations to exotically smooth regions, leading to examples such as exotic black holes and exotic cosmological models.
We address the problem of determining effective equations of motion for sources in field theories, where finite propagation speeds lead to radiation reaction and runaway solutions. Acoustics is used to illustrate a solution of this problem: The effective equation of motion is obtained by reduction to an inertial manifold. This equation can be approximated to any desired accuracy by expansion (and truncation) in powers of the reciprocal of the wave propagation speed and reduction to a slow manifold of a singular perturbation problem.

It is demonstrated that a spin-rotation coupling term only appears in the Hamiltonian of a Dirac particle if the rotating frame obeys the rules of Fermi–Walker transport. This is illustrated by examples in Minkowski space and the paper concludes with some speculations about spin-rotation coupling in Kerr space-time.
External gravitational fields induce phase factors in the wave functions of particles. The phases are exact to first order in the background gravitational field, are manifestly covariant and gauge invariant and provide a useful tool for the study of spin–gravity coupling and of the optics of particles in gravitational or inertial fields. We discuss the role that spin–gravity coupling plays in particular problems.
The hypothesis of coupling between spin and rotation introduced long ago by Mashhoon is examined in the context of “1 + 3” and “3 + 1” space-time splitting techniques, either in special or in general relativity. Its content is discussed in terms of classical (Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon–Souriou model) as well as quantum physics (Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation for the Dirac field in an external field), reviewing and discussing all the relevant theoretical literature concerning the existence of such effect. Some original contributions are also included.
A perturbation method to analytically describe the dynamics of a classical spinning particle, based on the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon (MPD) equations of motion, is presented. By a power series expansion with respect to the particle’s spin magnitude, it is shown how to obtain in general form an analytic representation of the particle’s kinematic and dynamical degrees of freedom that is formally applicable to infinite order in the expansion. Within this formalism, it is possible to identify a classical analogue of radiative corrections to the particle’s mass and spin due to spin–gravity interaction. The robustness of this approach is demonstrated by showing how to explicitly compute the first-order momentum and spin tensor components for arbitrary particle motion in a general space–time background. Potentially interesting applications based on this perturbation approach are outlined.
Classical radiation from an accelerated charge is reviewed along with the reciprocal topic of accelerated observers detecting radiation from a static charge.
There is a non-linear and covariant electromagnetic analogy for gravity, in which the full Bianchi identities are Maxwell-type equations for the free gravitational field, encoded in the Weyl tensor. This tensor gravito-electromagnetism is based on a covariant generalization of spatial vector algebra and calculus to spatial tensor fields, and includes all non-linear effects from the gravitational field and matter sources. The non-linear vacuum Bianchi equations are invariant under spatial duality rotation of the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tensor fields. The super-energy density and super-Poynting vector of the gravitational field are natural duality invariants, and satisfy a super-energy conservation equation.
In this paper, the axion contribution to the electromagnetic wave propagation is studied. First we show how the axion electrodynamics model can be embedded into a premetric formalism of Maxwell electrodynamics. In this formalism, the axion field is not an arbitrary added Chern–Simon term of the Lagrangian, but emerges in a natural way as an irreducible part of a general constitutive tensor. We show that in order to represent the axion contribution to the wave propagation it is necessary to go beyond the geometric approximation, which is usually used in the premetric formalism. We derive a covariant dispersion relation for the axion modified electrodynamics. The wave propagation in this model is studied for an axion field with timelike, spacelike and null derivative covectors. The birefringence effect emerges in all these classes as a signal of Lorentz violation. This effect is however completely different from the ordinary birefringence appearing in classical optics and in premetric electrodynamics. The axion field does not simple double the ordinary light cone structure. In fact, it modifies the global topological structure of light cones surfaces. In CFJ-electrodynamics, such a modification results in violation of causality. In addition, the optical metrics in axion electrodynamics are not pseudo-Riemannian. In fact, for all types of the axion field, they are even non-Finslerian.
The coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity is discussed. In the premetric axiomatic approach based on the experimentally well established conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux, the Maxwell equations are the same irrespective of the presence or absence of gravity. In this sense, one can say that the charge “substratum” and the flux “substratum” are not influenced by the gravitational field directly. However, the interrelation between these fundamental substrata, formalized as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">spacetime relation </em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>) between the 2-forms of the electromagnetic excitation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> and the electromagnetic field strength <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>, is affected by gravity. Thus the validity of the equivalence principle for electromagnetism depends on the form of the spacetime relation. We discuss the nonlocal and local linear constitutive relations and demonstrate that the spacetime metric can be accompanied also by skewon, dilaton, and axion fields. All these premetric companions of the metric may eventually lead to a violation of the equivalence principle.
Orbits of test particles and light rays are an important tool to study the properties of space-time metrics. Here we systematically study the properties of the gravitational field of a globally regular magnetic monopole in terms of the geodesics of test particles and light. The gravitational field depends on two dimensionless parameters, defined as ratios of the characteristic mass scales present. For critical values of these parameters the resulting metric coefficients develop a singular behavior, which has profound influence on the properties of the resulting space-time and which is clearly reflected in the orbits of the test particles and light rays.
We consider globally regular and black hole solutions in SU(2) Einstein–Yang–Mills–Higgs theory, coupled to a dilaton field. The basic solutions represent magnetic monopoles, monopole–antimonopole systems or black holes with monopole or dipole hair. When the globally regular solutions carry additionally electric charge, an angular momentum density results, except in the simplest spherically symmetric case. We evaluate the global charges of the solutions and their effective action, and analyze their dependence on the gravitational coupling strength. We show, that in the presence of a dilaton field, the black hole solutions satisfy a generalized Smarr type mass formula.
The curvature-squared model of gravity, in the affine form proposed by Weyl and Yang, is deduced from a topological action in 4D. More specifically, we start from the Pontrjagin (or Euler) invariant. Using the BRST antifield formalism with a double duality <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gauge fixing</em>, we obtain a consistent quantization in spaces of double dual curvature as classical instanton type background. However, exact vacuum solutions with double duality properties exhibit a ‘vacuum degeneracy’. By modifying the duality via a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">scale breaking</em> term, we demonstrate that only Einstein’s equations with an induced <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cosmological constant</em> emerge for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">topology</em> of the macroscopic background. This may have repercussions on the problem of ‘dark energy’ as well as ‘dark matter’ modeled by a torsion induced quintaxion.
In statistical mechanics Gibbs’ paradox is avoided if the particles of a gas are assumed to be indistinguishable. The resulting entropy then agrees with the empirically tested thermodynamic entropy up to a term proportional to the logarithm of the particle number. We discuss here how analogous situations arise in the statistical foundation of black-hole entropy. Depending on the underlying approach to quantum gravity, the fundamental objects to be counted have to be assumed indistinguishable or not in order to arrive at the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. We also show that the logarithmic corrections to this entropy, including their signs, can be understood along the lines of standard statistical mechanics. We illustrate the general concepts within the area quantization model of Bekenstein and Mukhanov.
We study the classical geodesic motions of nonzero rest mass test particles and photons in (3 + 1 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>)- dimensional warped product spaces. An important feature of these spaces is that they allow a natural decoupling between the motions in the (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime and those in the extra <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> dimensions. Using this decoupling and employing phase space analysis we investigate the conditions for confinement of particles and photons to the (3 + 1)- spacetime submanifold. In addition to providing information regarding the motion of photons, we also show that these motions are not constrained by the value of the extrinsic curvature. We obtain the general conditions for the confinement of geodesics in the case of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds as well as establishing the conditions for the stability of such confinement. These results also generalise a recent result of the authors concerning the embeddings of hypersurfaces with codimension one.
I give a personal retrospect covering the years during which Mashhoon, myself and others developed a unification of the gravitational field and its source (matter). In this geometrical approach, Einstein’s 4D field equations of general relativity with a source are derived from the 5D Ricci equations for apparent vacuum. The main equations are given, along with comments on how they were arrived at. They describe gravity, electromagnetism and a scalar field. This induced-matter or space–time–matter theory is in agreement with observation and invites further development.
A Hamiltonian approach makes the phenomenon of frame dragging apparent “up front” from the appearance of the drag velocity in the Hamiltonian of a test particle in an arbitrary metric. Hamiltonian (1) uses the inhomogeneous force equation (4), which applies to non-geodesic motion as well as to geodesics. The Hamiltonian is not in manifestly covariant form, but is covariant because it is derived from Hamilton’s manifestly covariant scalar action principle. A distinction is made between manifest frame dragging such as that in the Kerr metric, and hidden frame dragging that can be made manifest by a coordinate transformation such as that applied to the Robertson–Walker metric in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 a zone of repulsive gravity is found in the extreme Kerr metric. Section 4 treats frame dragging in special relativity as a manifestation of the equivalence principle in accelerated frames. It answers a question posed by Bell about how the Lorentz contraction can break a thread connecting two uniformly accelerated rocket ships. In Sect. 5 the form of the Hamiltonian facilitates the definition of gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric potentials.
By using the sixth order WKB approximation we calculate for an electromagnetic field propagating in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) black holes its quasinormal (QN) frequencies for the fundamental mode and first overtones. We study the dependence of these QN frequencies on the value of the cosmological constant and the spacetime dimension. We also compare with the results for the gravitational perturbations propagating in the same background. Moreover we compute exactly the QN frequencies of the electromagnetic field propagating in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional massless topological black hole and for the charged <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Nariai spacetime we calculate exactly the QN frequencies of the coupled electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.
A generalized FRW model of space-time is studied, taking into consideration the anisotropic structure of fields which are depended on the position and the direction (velocity). The Raychaudhouri and Friedman-like equations are investigated assuming the Finslerian character of space-time. A long range vector field of cosmological origin is considered in relation to a physical geometry where the Cartan connection has a fundamental role. The Friedman equations are produced including extra anisotropic terms. The variation of anisotropy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub> is expressed in terms of the Cartan torsion tensor of the Finslerian manifold. A physical generalization of the Hubble and other cosmological parameters arises as a direct consequence of the equations of motion.
We find an exact solution for the stability limit of relativistic charged spheres for the case of constant gravitational mass density and constant charge density. We argue that this provides an absolute stability limit for any relativistic charged sphere in which the gravitational mass density decreases with radius and the charge density increases with radius. We then provide a cruder absolute stability limit that applies to any charged sphere with a spherically symmetric mass and charge distribution. We give numerical results for all cases. In addition, we discuss the example of a neutral sphere surrounded by a thin, charged shell.
The probability representation of quantum mechanics including propagators and tomograms of quantum states of the universe and its application to quantum gravity and cosmology are reviewed. The minisuperspaces modeled by oscillator, free pointlike particle and repulsive oscillator are considered. The notion of tomographic entropy and its properties are used to find some inequalities for the tomographic probability determining the quantum state of the universe. The sense of the inequality as a lower bound for the entropy is clarified.
We proposes an alternative model of duality symmetry, based on the previously obtained divergence theory, including an scalar field, an internal vector and a metric signature. At some small scale an effective scalar field equation has appeared whose potential acts like a Higgs one, where the metric signature plays the role of an order parameter. Non-vanishing Vacuum condensation of this Higgs field occurs once a signature change from Euclidean to Lorentzian is formed. The mass scale of Higgs field excitations around this vacuum may contribute, in the Lorentzian sector, to the cosmological constant, in agreement with observations.
Intrinsic time-dependent invariants are constructed for classical, flat, homogeneous, anisotropic cosmology with a massless scalar material source. Invariance under the time reparameterization-induced canonical symmetry group is displayed explicitly.
We use the Bianchi-I spacetime to study the local dynamics of a magnetized self-gravitating Fermi gas. The set of Einstein–Maxwell field equations for this gas becomes a dynamical system in a 4D phase space. We consider a qualitative study and examine numeric solutions for the degenerate zero temperature case. All dynamic quantities exhibit similar qualitative behavior in the 3D sections of the phase space, with all trajectories reaching a stable attractor whenever the initial expansion scalar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub>0</sub> is negative. If <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub>0</sub> is positive the trajectories end up in a curvature singularity that can be, depending on initial conditions, isotropic or anisotropic. In particular, if the initial magnetic field intensity is sufficiently large the collapsing singularity will always be anisotropic and pointing in the same direction of the field.
We observe that when a local patch in a radiation filled Robertson–Walker universe inflates by some reason, outside perturbations can enter into the inflating region. Generally, the physical wavelengths of these perturbations become larger than the Hubble radius as they cross into the inflating space and their amplitudes freeze out immediately. It turns out that the corresponding power spectrum is not scale invariant. Although these perturbations cannot reach out to a distance inner observer shielded by a de Sitter horizon, they still indicate a curious boundary effect in local inflationary scenarios.
We consider the possibility of testing the equivalence principle (EP) in the gravitational field of the Earth from the orbits of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites, which are very accurately tracked from ground by laser ranging. The orbital elements that are affected by an EP violation and can be used to measure the corresponding dimensionless parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> are semimajor axis and argument of pericenter. We show that the best result is obtained from the semimajor axis, and it is limited—with all available ranging data to LAGEOS and LAGEOS II—to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> ≃ 2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, more than 3 orders of magnitude worse than experimental results provided by torsion balances. The experiment is limited because of the non uniformity of the gravitational field of the Earth and the error in the measurement of semimajor axis, precisely in the same way as they limit the measurement of the product <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GM</em> of the Earth. A better use of the pericenter of LAGEOS II can be made if the data are analyzed searching for a new Yukawa-like interaction with a distance scale of one Earth radius. It is found that the pericenter of LAGEOS II is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to a composition dependent new interaction with this particular scale than it is to a composition dependent effect expressed by the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> parameter only. Nevertheless, the result is still a factor 500 worse than EP tests with torsion balances in the gravitational field of the Earth (i.e. at comparable distance), though a detailed data analysis has yet to be performed. While EP tests with satellite laser ranging are not competitive, laser ranging to the Moon has been able to provide a test of the EP almost 1 order of magnitude better than torsion balances. We show that this is due to the much greater distance of the test masses (the Earth and the Moon) from the primary body (the Sun) and the correspondingly smaller gradients of its gravity field. We therefore consider a similar new experiment involving the orbit of LAGEOS: testing LAGEOS and the Earth for an EP violation in the gravitational field of the Sun. We show that this test may be of interest, though it is a factor 300 less sensitive than in the case of the Moon due to the fact that LAGEOS is closer to the Earth than the Moon and consequently its orbit is less affected by the Sun. The limitations we have pointed out for laser ranging can be overcome by flying in low Earth orbit a spacecraft carrying concentric test masses of different composition with the capability, already demonstrated in ground laboratories, to accurately sense in situ any differential effects between them.

The seminal paper by Ya. B. Zeldovich (Soviet Physics Uspekhi <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">11</strong>, 381–393, 1968) is reprinted here, together with an editorial comment on its lasting scientific relevance, and a biography of the author.
In this work we extend previous work on the evolution of a primordial black hole (PBH) to address the presence of a dark energy component with a super-negative equation of state as a background, investigating the competition between the radiation accretion, the Hawking evaporation and the phantom accretion, the latter two causing a decrease on black hole mass. It is found that there is an instant during the matter-dominated era after which the radiation accretion becomes negligible compared to the phantom accretion. The Hawking evaporation may become important again depending on a mass threshold. The evaporation of PBHs is quite modified at late times by these effects, but only if the generalized second law of thermodynamics is violated.
A model of an emergent universe is obtained in brane world. Here the bulk energy is in the form of cosmological constant, while the brane consists of a fluid satisfying an equation of state of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({p_{b}=\frac{1}{3}\rho_{b}}\)</span> , which is effectively a radiation equation of state at high energies. It is shown that with the positive bulk cosmological constant, one of our models represents an emergent universe.
Recently, Helliwell and Konkowski have examined the quantum “healing” of some classical singularities in certain power-law spacetimes. Here I further examine classical properties of these spacetimes and show that some of them contain naked strong curvature singularities.
An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th/0609202, and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in (2 + 1)-dimensional AdS.
Cosmological models with two interacting fluids, each satisfying the strong energy condition, are studied in the framework of classical General Relativity. If the interactions are phenomenologically described by a power law in the scale factor, the two initial interacting fluids can be equivalently substituted by two non interacting effective fluids, where one of them may violate the strong energy condition and/or have negative energy density. Analytical solutions of the Friedmann equations of this general setting are obtained and studied. One may have, depending on the scale where the interaction becomes important, non singular universes with early accelerated phase, or singular models with transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at large scales. Among the first, there are bouncing models where contraction is stopped by the interaction. In the second case, one obtains dark energy expansion rates without dark energy, like ΛCDM or phantomic accelerated expansions without cosmological constant or phantoms, respectively.
We present perfect fluid Friedmann–Robertson–Walker quantum cosmological models in the presence of negative cosmological constant. In this work the Schutz’s variational formalism is applied for radiation, dust, cosmic string, and domain wall dominated Universes with positive, negative, and zero constant spatial curvature. In this approach the notion of time can be recovered. These give rise to Wheeler–DeWitt equations for the scale factor. We find their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by using Spectral Method. After that, we use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case and evaluate the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factors, which are found to oscillate between finite maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation values of the scale factors never tends to the singular point, we have an initial indication that these models may not have singularities at the quantum level.
One approach in modern cosmology consists in supposing that dark matter and dark energy are different manifestations of a single “quartessential” fluid. Following such idea, this work presents a study of the evolution of perturbations of density in a flat cosmological model with a modified Chaplygin gas acting as a single component. Our goal is to obtain properties of the model which can be used to distinguish it from another cosmological models which have the same solutions for the general evolution of the scale factor of the universe, without the construction of the power spectrum. Our analytical results, which alone can be used to uniquely characterize the specific model studied in our work, show that the evolution of the density contrast can be seen, at least in one particular case, as composed by a spheroidal wave function. We also present a numerical analysis which clearly indicates as one interesting feature of the model the appearance of peaks in the evolution of the density contrast.
We present expressions for the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum carried away from an isolated system by gravitational radiation based on spin-weighted spherical harmonics decomposition of the Weyl scalar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ψ</em> <sub>4</sub>. We also show that the expressions derived are equivalent to the common expressions obtained when using a framework based on perturbations of a Schwazschild background. The main idea is to collect together all the different expressions in a uniform and consistent way. The formulae presented here are directly applicable to the calculation of the radiated energy, linear momentum and angular momentum starting from the gravitational waveforms which are typically extracted from numerical simulations.
We search for possible time lags caused by quantum gravitational effects using gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by INTEGRAL. The advantage of this satellite is that we have at our disposal the energy and arrival time of every detected single photon, which enhances the precision of the time resolution. We present a new method for seeking time lags in unbinned data using a maximum likelihood method and support our conclusions with Monte Carlo simulations. The analysis establishes a conservative lower bound on the Lorentz invariance violation scale, which is several orders of magnitude below the Planck mass, whose value may however increase if better statistics of GRBs were available. Furthermore, we disagree with previous studies in which a non-monotonic function of the redshift was used to perform a linear fit.
We modify the Einstein–Schrödinger theory to include a cosmological constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> </sub> which multiplies the symmetric metric, and we show how the theory can be easily coupled to additional fields. The cosmological constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> </sub> is assumed to be nearly cancelled by Schrödinger’s cosmological constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sub> which multiplies the nonsymmetric fundamental tensor, such that the total <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> =  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> </sub> +  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> </sub> matches measurement. The resulting theory becomes exactly Einstein–Maxwell theory in the limit as |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> </sub>| → ∞. For |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> </sub>| ~ 1/(Planck length)<sup>2</sup> the field equations match the ordinary Einstein and Maxwell equations except for extra terms which are &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup> of the usual terms for worst-case field strengths and rates-of-change accessible to measurement. Additional fields can be included in the Lagrangian, and these fields may couple to the symmetric metric and the electromagnetic vector potential, just as in Einstein–Maxwell theory. The ordinary Lorentz force equation is obtained by taking the divergence of the Einstein equations when sources are included. The Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann (EIH) equations of motion match the equations of motion for Einstein–Maxwell theory to Newtonian/Coulombian order, which proves the existence of a Lorentz force without requiring sources. This fixes a problem of the original Einstein–Schrödinger theory, which failed to predict a Lorentz force. An exact charged solution matches the Reissner–Nordström solution except for additional terms which are ~10<sup>−66</sup> of the usual terms for worst-case radii accessible to measurement. An exact electromagnetic plane-wave solution is identical to its counterpart in Einstein–Maxwell theory.
We develop a non-linear relativistic model of the Shapley Concentration (SC) and its environs, including the Great Attractor (GA) and the Local Group (LG). We take the Shapley Concentration as a major attractive centre, and we use the Lemaître–Tolman model. We constrain our model with present day observations, plus the requirement that it have a physically reasonable evolution from small perturbations at last scattering. We investigate possible mass and velocity distributions, and we find that the peculiar velocity maximum near the SC is ~800 km/s inwards, the density between GA and SC must be about ~0.9 times background, the mass of the GA is probably 4–6 × 10<sup>15</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, the SC’s contribution to the LG motion is negligible, and the value of the cosmological constant is not significant on this scale.
Within our thick brane approach previously used to obtain the cosmological evolution equations on a thick brane embedded in a five-dimensional Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter spacetime it is explicitly shown that the consistency of these equations with the energy conservation equation requires that, in general, the thickness of the brane evolves in time. This varying brane thickness entails the possibility that both Newton’s gravitational constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and the effective cosmological constant Λ<sub>4</sub> are time dependent.
In a recent note Ellis criticizes varying speed of light theories on the grounds of a number of foundational issues. His reflections provide us with an opportunity to clarify some fundamental matters pertaining to these theories.


We investigate Kerr–Newman black holes in which a rotating charged ring-shaped singularity induces a region which contains closed timelike curves (CTCs). Contrary to popular belief, it turns out that the time orientation of the CTC is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">opposite</em> to the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere rotates. In this sense, CTCs “counter-rotate” against the rotating black hole. We have similar results for all spacetimes sufficiently familiar to us in which rotation induces CTCs. This motivates our conjecture that perhaps this counter-rotation is not an accidental oddity particular to Kerr–Newman spacetimes, but instead there may be a general and intuitively comprehensible reason for this.
We give all exact solutions of the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet Field Equations coupled with a scalar field in four dimensions under certain assumptions. The main assumption we make in this work is to take the second covariant derivative of the coupling function proportional to the spacetime metric tensor. Although this assumption simplifies the field equations considerably, to obtain exact solutions we assume also that the spacetime metric is conformally flat. Then we obtain a class of exact solutions.
We study chaos dynamics of spinning particles in Kerr spacetime of rotating black holes use the Papapetrou equations by numerical integration. Because of spin, this system exists many chaos solutions, and exhibits some exceptional dynamic character. We investigate the relations between the orbits chaos and the spin magnitude <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>, pericenter, polar angle and Kerr rotation parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> by means of a kind of brand new Fast Lyapulov Indicator (FLI) which is defined in general relativity. The classical definition of Lyapulov exponent (LE) perhaps fails in curve spacetime. And we emphasize that the Poincaré sections cannot be used to detect chaos for this case. Via calculations, some new interesting conclusions are found: though chaos is easier to emerge with bigger S, but not always depends on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> monotonically; the Kerr parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> has a contrary action on the chaos occurrence. Furthermore, the spin of particles can destroy the symmetry of the orbits about the equatorial plane. And for some special initial conditions, the orbits have equilibrium points.
Recently, Li and Liu have studied global monopole of tachyon in a four dimensional static space–time. We analyze the motion of massless and massive particles around tachyon monopole. Interestingly, for the bending of light rays due to tachyon monopole instead of getting angle of deficit we find angle of surplus. Also we find that the tachyon monopole exerts an attractive gravitational force towards matter.
In systems with a large degeneracy of states such as black holes, one expects that the average value of probe correlation functions will be well approximated by the thermal ensemble. To understand how correlation functions in individual microstates differ from the canonical ensemble average and from each other, we study the variances in correlators. Using general statistical considerations, we show that the variance between microstates will be exponentially suppressed in the entropy. However, by exploiting the analytic properties of correlation functions we argue that these variances are amplified in imaginary time, thereby distinguishing pure states from the thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our general results in specific examples and argue that our results apply to the microstates of black holes.
We propose a Curvature Principle to describe the dynamics of interacting universes in a multi-universe scenario and show, in the context of a simplified model, how interaction drives the cosmological constant of one of the universes toward a vanishingly small value. We also conjecture on how the proposed Curvature Principle suggests a solution for the entropy paradox of a universe where the cosmological constant vanishes.
In the context of gravity’s rainbow, Planck scale correction on Hawking radiation and black hole entropy in Parikh and Wilczk’s tunneling framework is studied. We calculate the tunneling probability of massless particles in the modified Schwarzschild black holes from gravity’s rainbow. In the tunneling process, when a particle gets across the horizon, the metric fluctuation must be taken into account, not only due to energy conservation but also to spacetime Planck scale effect. Our results show that the emission rate is related to changes of the black hole’s quantum corrected entropies before and after the emission. In the same time, for the modified black holes, a series of correction terms including a logarithmic term to Bekenstein–Hawking entropy are obtained. Correspondingly, the spectrum of Planck scale corrected emission is obtained and it deviates from the thermal spectrum. In addition, a specific form of modified dispersion relation is proposed and applied.
Both the Einstein–Hilbert action and the Einstein equations are discussed under the absolute vierbein formalism. Taking advantage of this form, we prove that the “kinetic energy” term, i.e., the quadratic term of time derivative term, in the Lagrangian of the Einstein–Hilbert action is non-positive definitive. And then, we present two groups of coordinate conditions that lead to positive definitive kinetic energy term in the Lagrangian, as well as the corresponding actions with positive definitive kinetic energy term, respectively. Based on the ADM decomposition, the Hamiltonian representation and canonical quantization of general relativity taking advantage of the actions with positive definitive kinetic energy term are discussed; especially, the Hamiltonian constraints with positive definitive kinetic energy term are given, respectively. Finally, we present a group of gauge conditions such that there is not any second time derivative term in the ten Einstein equations.
The elasticity difference tensor, used in [1] to describe elasticity properties of a continuous medium filling a space-time, is here analysed. Principal directions associated with this tensor are compared with eigendirections of the material metric. Examples concerning spherically symmetric and axially symmetric space-times are then presented.
We have quantized a flat cosmological model in the context of the metric <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({f(\mathcal R)}\)</span> models, using the causal Bohmian quantum theory. The equations are solved and then we have obtained how the quantum corrections influence the classical equations.
We construct the embedding of the manifold <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> <sup>2</sup> + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> <sup>2</sup> − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> <sup>2</sup> − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sup>2</sup> = 1 carrying the most general homogeneous metric into the eight-dimensional pseudo sphere.

Using some suitable combinations of a dynamical unit time-like four-velocity of a preferred reference frame, Ricci tensor and covariant derivatives of the Brans–Dicke (BD) scalar field, we propose a new scalar–vector–tensor gravity model in which an Euclidean Jordan–Brans–Dicke (JBD) action is reduced to its Lorentzian version with no used complex coordinates. Thus it should be play an important role in the process of metric signature transition of a suitable dynamical curved space-time. In this work we follow the ideas proposed by Barbero et al. As an application of the model, we study a classical perfect fluid cosmological universe described in a flat Robertson–Walker background metric. Mathematical derivations of the equations predict a non-singular scale factor for the space-time in the both of dust and radiation dominated states where value of the Brans–Dicke parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\omega}\)</span> is fixed, but there is still an arbitrary parameter which should be determined by the boundary values of the cosmological system. Furthermore its classical cosmological vacuum solutions is obtained as a non-singular model with a fixed Brans–Dicke parameter. Although there is obtained a singular perfect fluid cosmological solution which may not be suitable, because in this case the Brans–Dicke parameter is not still fixed.
The generation method developed by Newman et al. which creates from spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations by a complex coordinate transformation axisymmetric solutions is extended to five-dimensional relativity.
A problem in general relativity is how to extract physical information from solutions to the Einstein equations. Most often information is found from special conditions, e.g., special vector fields, symmetries or approximate symmetries. Our concern is with asymptotically flat space–times with approximate symmetry: the BMS group. For these spaces the Bondi four-momentum vector and its evolution, found at infinity, describes the total energy–momentum and the energy–momentum radiated. By generalizing the simple idea of the transformation of (electromagnetic) dipoles under a translation, we define (analogous to center of charge) the center of mass for asymptotically flat Einstein–Maxwell fields. This gives kinematical meaning to the Bondi four-momentum, i.e., the four-momentum and its evolution which is described in terms of a center of mass position vector, its velocity and spin-vector. From dynamical arguments, a unique (for our approximation) total angular momentum and evolution equation in the form of a conservation law is found.

It is well known that one could determine the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">kinematics</em> of gravity by using the Principle of Equivalence and local inertial frames. I describe how the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dynamics</em> of gravity can be similarly understood by suitable thought experiments in a local Rindler frame. This approach puts in proper context several unexplained features of gravity and describes the dynamics of spacetime in a broader setting than in Einstein’s theory.
There ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical spacetime manifold. Such a reformulation can be achieved using the language of noncommutative differential geometry. A consequence which follows is that the ‘weakly quantum, strongly gravitational’ dynamics of a relativistic particle whose mass is much greater than Planck mass is dual to the ‘strongly quantum, weakly gravitational’ dynamics of another particle whose mass is much less than Planck mass. The masses of the two particles are inversely related to each other, and the product of their masses is equal to the square of Planck mass. This duality explains the observed value of the cosmological constant, and also why this value is nonzero but extremely small in Planck units.
To make sense of quantum field theory in an arbitrary (globally hyperbolic) curved spacetime, the theory must be formulated in a local and covariant manner in terms of locally measurable field observables. Since a generic curved spacetime does not possess symmetries or a unique notion of a vacuum state, the theory also must be formulated in a manner that does not require symmetries or a preferred notion of a “vacuum state” and “particles”. We propose such a formulation of quantum field theory, wherein the operator product expansion (OPE) of the quantum fields is elevated to a fundamental status, and the quantum field theory is viewed as being defined by its OPE. Since the OPE coefficients may be better behaved than any quantities having to do with states, we suggest that it may be possible to perturbatively construct the OPE coefficients—and, thus, the quantum field theory. By contrast, ground/vacuum states—in spacetimes, such as Minkowski spacetime, where they may be defined—cannot vary analytically with the parameters of the theory. We argue that this implies that composite fields may acquire nonvanishing vacuum state expectation values due to nonperturbative effects. We speculate that this could account for the existence of a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of a quantum field occurring at a scale much smaller than the natural scales of the theory.
Identifying the fundamental degrees of freedom of a black hole poses a long-standing puzzle. Recently Goldberger and Rothstein forwarded a theory of the low frequency degrees of freedom within the effective field theory approach, where they are relevancy ordered but of unclear physical origin. Here these degrees of freedom are identified with near-horizon but non-compact gravitational perturbations which are decomposed into delocalized multipoles. Their world-line (kinetic) action is determined within the classical effective field theory (CLEFT) approach and their interactions are discussed. The case of the long-wavelength scattering of a scalar wave off a Schwarzschild black hole is treated in some detail, interpreting within the CLEFT approach the equality of the leading absorption cross section with the horizon area.
We investigate four-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions in gravity theories with massless, neutral scalars non-minimally coupled to gauge fields. In the non-extremal case, we explicitly show that, under the variation of the moduli, the scalar charges appear in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. In the extremal limit, the near horizon geometry is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> <sub>2</sub> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> and the entropy does not depend on the values of moduli at infinity. We discuss the attractor behaviour by using Sen’s entropy function formalism as well as the effective potential approach and their relation with the results previously obtained through special geometry method. We also argue that the attractor mechanism is at the basis of the matching between the microscopic and macroscopic entropies for the extremal non-BPS Kaluza–Klein black hole.
Hawking tunneling radiation of spin − 1/2 particles from the event horizon of the Reissner–Nordström black hole is studied. We introduce the Dirac equation of the charged particles. We further consider the gravitational interaction and back reaction of the emitted spin particles in the dynamical background space–time. The result shows that when the energy conservation and charge conservation are taken into account, the actual radiation spectrum of fermions also derivates from the thermal one and the tunneling rate is related to the change of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.
We derive general conditions under which geodesics of stationary spacetimes resemble trajectories of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. For large curvatures (analogous to strong magnetic fields), the quantum mechanicical states of these particles are confined to gravitational analogs of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">lowest Landau levels</em>. Furthermore, there is an effective non-commutativity between their spatial coordinates. We point out that the Som–Raychaudhuri and Gödel spacetime and its generalisations are precisely of the above type and compute the effective non-commutativities that they induce. We show that the non-commutativity for Gödel spacetime is identical to that on the fuzzy sphere. Finally, we show how the star product naturally emerges in Som–Raychaudhuri spacetimes.
In this paper we obtain a height estimate concerning compact space-like hypersurfaces Σ<sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> immersed with some positive constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-mean curvature into an (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 1)-dimensional Lorentzian product space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({-\mathbb{R} \times M^n}\)</span> , and whose boundary is contained into a slice {<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>} × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup>. By considering the hyperbolic caps of the Lorentz–Minkowski space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathbb{L}^{n+1}}\)</span> , we show that our estimate is sharp. Furthermore, we apply this estimate to study the complete space-like hypersurfaces immersed with some positive constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-mean curvature into a Lorentzian product space. For instance, when the ambient space–time is spatially closed, we show that such hypersurfaces must satisfy the topological property of having more than one end which constitutes a necessary condition for their existence.
A new model is proposed to a collapsing radiating star consisting of an isotropic fluid with shear viscosity undergoing radial heat flow with outgoing radiation. In a previous paper we have introduced a function time dependent into the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rr</em> </sub>, besides the time dependent metric functions <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({g_{\theta\theta}}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({g_{\phi\phi}}\)</span>. The aim of this work is to generalize this previous model by introducing shear viscosity and compare it to the non-viscous collapse. The behavior of the density, pressure, mass, luminosity and the effective adiabatic index is analyzed. Our work is compared to the case of a collapsing shearing fluid of a previous model, for a star with 6 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({M_{\odot}}\)</span>. The pressure of the star, at the beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but due to the presence of the shear the pressure becomes more and more anisotropic. The black hole is never formed because the apparent horizon formation condition is never satisfied. An observer at infinity sees a radial point source radiating exponentially until reaches the time of maximum luminosity and suddenly the star turns off. The effective adiabatic index has a very unusual behavior because we have a non-adiabatic regime in the fluid due to the heat flow.
Consider a radially freely falling observer who plunges into a Schwarzschild black hole. In contrast to a static observer, he will have a different view of the black hole and of the outer sky. Furthermore, the relationship between the proper time of the falling observer and the proper time of a distant static observer differs from the relationship between the proper times of two static observers or two freely falling observers.
An oscillating Universe which arises from the linearized <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>2</sup> theory of gravity is discussed, showing that some observative evidences like the cosmological redshift and the Hubble law are in agreement with the model. In this context Dark Energy is seen like a pure curvature effect arising by the Ricci scalar.
Schwarzschild’s solution to the Einstein Field Equations was one of the first and most important solutions that lead to the understanding and important experimental tests of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. However, Schwarzschild’s solution is essentially based on an ideal theory of gravitation, where all inhomogeneities are ignored. Therefore, any generalization of the Schwarzschild solution should take into account the effects of small perturbations that may be present in the gravitational field. The theory of Macroscopic Gravity characterizes the effects of the inhomogeneities through a non-perturbative and covariant averaging procedure. With similar assumptions on the geometry and matter content, a solution to the averaged field equations as dictated by Macroscopic Gravity are derived. The resulting solution provides a possible explanation for the flattening of galactic rotation curves, illustrating that Dark Matter is not real but may only be the result of averaging inhomogeneities in a spherically symmetric background.
We vindicate our results in Mars and Senovilla (Phys Rev D 54, 6166–6180, 1996), which have been recently put in doubt or misunderstood in García and Ulloa (Gen Rel Grav 39, 1639–1650, 2007). In particular, we maintain that there indeed exist axially symmetric differentially rotating perfect-fluid solutions satisfying all energy conditions within the family of solutions presented in Senovilla (Class Quant Grav 9, L167–L169, 1992). We remark that the existence of an axis of symmetry can never be “re-interpreted” as the existence of a Killing horizon, and vice versa. We prove that such horizons are simply impossible for the perfect fluids within the family, and that regular axes of symmetry (or curvature singularities) are the only possibilities. Other inaccuracies or misunderstandings appeared in García and Ulloa (Gen Rel Grav 39, 1639–1650, 2007) are clarified.
In these lecture notes we describe recent progress in our understanding of attractor mechanism and entropy of extremal black holes based on the entropy function formalism. We also describe precise computation of the microscopic degeneracy of a class of quarter BPS dyons in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{N}=4}\)</span> supersymmetric string theories, and compare the statistical entropy of these dyons, expanded in inverse powers of electric and magnetic charges, with a similar expansion of the corresponding black hole entropy. This comparison is extended to include the contribution to the entropy from multi-centred black holes as well.
Gravitational radiation of binary systems can be studied by using the adiabatic approximation in General Relativity. In this approach a small astrophysical object follows a trajectory consisting of a chained series of bounded geodesics (orbits) in the outer region of a Kerr Black Hole, representing the space time created by a bigger object. In our paper, we study the entire class of orbits, both of constant radius (spherical orbits), as well as non-null eccentricity orbits, showing a number of properties on the physical parameters and trajectories. The main result is the determination of the geometrical locus of all the orbits in the space of physical parameters in Kerr space–time. This becomes a powerful tool to know if different orbits can be connected by a continuous change of their physical parameters. A discussion on the influence of different values of the angular momentum of the hole is given. Main results have been obtained by analytical methods.
It is shown by Clarke and Felice (J Phys A Math Gen 15:2415–2417, 1982) that under certain conditions a stationary space-time will produce a closed timelike curve through each point of the space-time. Here a simpler proof and a different version of their theorem are provided.

Fundamental particles, regarded as possible constituents of quarks and leptons, are described classically in the framework of the Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson’s Induced Matter Theory (IMT). There are neutral particles and particles having charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\pm \frac{1}{3}e\)</span>. The particles appear on the 4D brane, our universe, and are filled with an induced by the 5D bulk substance. This substance is taken to have mass density, pressure, and (if charged) charge density, and is characterized by the equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> = 0. The interior is separated from the surrounding vacuum by a spherical boundary surface where the components of the 4D metric tensor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> <sub>00</sub> = 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> <sub>11</sub> = 0. Outside of the boundary holds the Schwarzschild, or the Reissner–Nordstrøm metric, while the particles are characterized by Mass, Radius, Charge.
Non-minimal interactions in the pp-wave Einstein–Yang–Mills–Higgs (EYMH) model are shown to give rise to color cross-effects analogous to the magneto-electricity in the Maxwell theory. In order to illustrate the significance of these color cross-effects, we reconstruct the effective (associated, color, and color-acoustic) metrics for the pp-wave non-minimal seven-parameter EYMH model with parallel gauge and scalar background fields. Then these metrics are used as hints for obtaining explicit exact solutions of the non-minimally extended Yang–Mills and Higgs equations for the test fields propagating in the vacuum interacting with curvature. The influence of the non-minimal coupling on the test particle motion is interpreted in terms of the so-called trapped surfaces, introduced in the Analog Gravity theory.
The exact solution for the electromagnetic field occuring when the Kerr–Taub–NUT compact object is immersed (i) in an originally uniform magnetic field aligned along the axis of axial symmetry (ii) in dipolar magnetic field generated by current loop has been investigated. Effective potential of motion of charged test particle around Kerr–Taub–NUT gravitational source immersed in magnetic field with different values of external magnetic field and NUT parameter has been also investigated. In both cases presence of NUT parameter and magnetic field shifts stable circular orbits in the direction of the central gravitating object. Finally we find analytical solutions of Maxwell equations in the external background spacetime of a slowly rotating magnetized NUT star. The star is considered isolated and in vacuum, with monopolar configuration model for the stellar magnetic field.
Hawking radiation of particles with electric and magnetic charges from the Einstein–Maxwell-Dilaton–Axion black hole is derived via the anomaly cancellation method, initiated by Robinson and Wilczek and elaborated by Banerjee and Kulkarni recently. We reconstruct the electromagnetic field tensor to redefine the gauge potential and equivalent charge corresponding to the source with electric and magnetic charges. We only adopt the covariant gauge and gravitational anomalies to discuss the near-horizon quantum anomaly in the dragging coordinate frame. Our result shows that Hawking radiation in this case also can be reproduced from the viewpoint of anomaly.
We investigate the link between the warp function and the potential in Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) power-law cosmologies. We give a prescription to take advantage of the fact that there is always a choice of potential resulting in a constant ratio between pressure and energy density for a given a warp factor. We illustrate the method with several examples, and complete the investigation by showing how symmetries can be used to generate new DBI solutions from existing ones.
In 3+1 dimensions there are anti-de Sitter quotients which are black holes with toroidal event horizons. By analytic continuation of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter solution (and appropriate identifications) one finds two one parameter families of spacetimes that contain these quotient black holes. One of these families consists of B-metrics (“bubbles of nothing”), the other of black hole spacetimes. All of them have vanishing conserved charges.
The calculation of conserved charges of black holes is a rich problem, for which many methods are known. Until recently, there was some controversy on the proper definition of conserved charges in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This paper provides a systematic and explicit Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and the angular momenta of both asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any dimension <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>  ≥  4. This requires as a first step a precise determination of the asymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum. These conditions happen to be achieved in ellipsoidal coordinates adapted to the rotating solutions. The asymptotic symmetry algebra is found to be isomorphic either to the Poincaré algebra or to the <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">so</strong>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> − 1,2) algebra, as expected. In the asymptotically flat case, the boundary conditions involve a generalization of the parity conditions, introduced by Regge and Teitelboim, which are necessary to make the angular momenta finite. The charges are explicitly computed for Kerr and Kerr–AdS black holes for arbitrary <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> and they are shown to be in agreement with thermodynamical arguments.
We analyze the 3-parameter family of exact, regular, static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein’s equations (corresponding to a 2-parameter family of equations of state) due to Pant and Sah and “rediscovered” by Rosquist and by the present author. Except for the Buchdahl solutions which are contained as a limiting case, the fluids have finite radius and are physically realistic for suitable parameter ranges. The equations of state can be characterized geometrically by the property that the 3-metric on the static slices, rescaled conformally with the fourth power of any linear function of the norm of the static Killing vector, has constant scalar curvature. This local property does not require spherical symmetry; in fact it simplifies the proof of spherical symmetry of asymptotically flat solutions which we recall here for the Pant-Sah equations of state. We also consider a model in Newtonian theory with analogous geometric and physical properties, together with a proof of spherical symmetry of the asymptotically flat solutions.
Recently, Banerjee and Kulkarni (R. Banerjee, S. Kulkarni, arXiv: 0707. 2449 [hep-th]) suggested that it is conceptually clean and economical to use only the covariant anomaly to derive Hawking radiation from a black hole. Based upon this simplified formalism, we apply the covariant anomaly cancellation method to investigate Hawking radiation from a modified Schwarzschild black hole in the theory of rainbow gravity. Hawking temperature of the gravity’s rainbow black hole is derived from the energy-momentum flux by requiring it to cancel the covariant gravitational anomaly at the horizon. We stress that this temperature is exactly the same as that calculated by the method of cancelling the consistent anomaly.
The probability representation, in which cosmological quantum states are described by a standard positive probability distribution, is constructed for minisuperspace models selected by Noether symmetries. In such a case, the tomographic probability distribution provides the classical evolution for the models and can be considered an approach to select “observable” universes. Some specific examples, derived from Extended Theories of Gravity, are worked out. We discuss also how to connect tomograms, symmetries and cosmological parameters.
It is shown that non-rotating black holes in three or four dimensions possess a canonical entropy. Recently study indicated that there were logarithmic corrections to Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in area with a uncertain coefficient which depends on specific models. In this paper, the thermal fluctuations on Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in five-dimensional topological AdS (TAds)-black holes and topological de Sitter (Tds) spaces will be considered based on a uniformly spaced area spectrum approach.
Several examples are known where quantum gravity effects resolve the classical big bang singularity by a bounce. The most detailed analysis has probably occurred for loop quantum cosmology of isotropic models sourced by a free, massless scalar. Once a bounce has been realized under fairly general conditions, the central questions are how strongly quantum it behaves, what influence quantum effects can have on its appearance, and what quantum space-time beyond the bounce may look like. This, then, has to be taken into account for effective equations which describe the evolution properly and can be used for further phenomenological investigations. Here, we provide the first analysis with interacting matter with new effective equations valid for weak self-interactions or small masses. They differ from the free scalar equations by crucial terms and have an important influence on the bounce and the space-time around it. Especially the role of squeezed states, which have often been overlooked in this context, is highlighted. The presence of a bounce is proven for uncorrelated states, but as squeezing is a dynamical property and may change in time, further work is required for a general conclusion.

We derive, for the square operator of Yau, an analogue of the Omori–Yau maximum principle for the Laplacian. We then apply it to obtain nonexistence results concerning complete noncompact spacelike hypersurfaces immersed with constant higher order mean curvature in a conformally stationary Lorentz manifold.
Solutions of vacuum Einstein’s field equations describing uniformly accelerated particles or black holes belong to the class of boost-rotation symmetric spacetimes. They are the only explicit solutions known which represent moving finite objects. Their Newtonian limit is analyzed using the Ehlers frame theory. Generic spacetimes with axial and boost symmetries are first studied from the Newtonian perspective. The results are then illustrated by specific examples such as C-metric, Bonnor–Swaminarayan solutions, self-accelerating “dipole particles”, and generalized boost-rotation symmetric solutions describing freely falling particles in an external field. In contrast to some previous discussions, our results are physically plausible in the sense that the Newtonian limit corresponds to the fields of classical point masses accelerated uniformly in classical mechanics. This corroborates the physical significance of the boost-rotation symmetric spacetimes.
General relativity considers Dixon’s theory as the standard theory to deal with the motion of extended bodies in a given gravitational background. We discuss here the features of the “reaction” of an extended body to the passage of a weak gravitational wave. We find that the body acquires a dipolar moment induced by its quadrupole structure. Furthermore, we derive the “world function” for the weak field limit of a gravitational wave background and use it to estimate the deviation between geodesics and the world lines of structured bodies. Measuring such deviations, due to the existence of cumulative effects, should be favorite with respect to measuring the amplitude of the gravitational wave itself.
Assuming that dark energy may be treated as a fluid with a well-defined temperature, close to equilibrium, we argue that if nowadays there is a transfer of energy between dark energy and dark matter, it must be such that the latter gains energy from the former and not the other way around.
We use a new, conformally invariant method of analysis to test incomplete null geodesics approaching the singularity in a model of an evaporating black hole for the possibility of extensions of the conformal metric. In general, a local conformal extension is possible from the future but not from the past.
The dynamics of homogeneous Robertson–Walker cosmological models with a self-interacting scalar field source is examined here in full generality, requiring only the scalar field potential to be bounded from below and divergent when the field diverges. In this way we are able to give a unified treatment of all the already studied cases—such as positive potentials which exhibit asymptotically polynomial or exponential behaviors—together with its extension to a much wider set of physically sensible potentials. Since the set includes potentials with negative inferior bound, we are able to give, in particular, the analysis of the asymptotically anti De Sitter states for such cosmologies.
Aether theory is introduced to implement the violation of the Lorentz invariance in general relativity. For this purpose a unit timelike vector field is introduced to the theory in addition to the metric tensor. Aether theory contains four free parameters which satisfy some inequalities in order that the theory to be consistent with the observations. We show that the Gödel type of metrics of general relativity are also exact solutions of the Einstein–aether theory. The only field equations are the 3D Maxwell field equations and the parameters are left free except <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sub>1</sub> − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sub>3</sub> = 1.
We consider the problem of finding a dual formulation of gravity in the presence of non-trivial matter couplings. In the absence of matter a dual graviton can be introduced only for linearised gravitational interactions. We show that the coupling of linearised gravity to matter poses obstructions to the usual construction and comment on possible resolutions of this difficulty.
Homogeneous and isotropic models are studied in the Jordan frame of the second order gravity theory. The late time evolution of the models is analysed with the methods of the dynamical systems. The normal form of the dynamical system has periodic solutions for a large set of initial conditions. This implies that an initially expanding closed isotropic universe may exhibit oscillatory behaviour.
The effect of the cosmological constant on the curvature of light due to an isolated spherical mass is recalculated without using the lens equation and compared to a lensing cluster.
The gravitational field of a photon on an infinite straight path is a single sheet of plane-fronted gravitational wave accompanying the photon and perpendicular to its track. This field cannot arise from a retarded potential generated by the photon, and I suggest that it arises in the process of emission. The near-field depends on the energy of the photon, but the far-field does not. The field of a steady beam of photons is compared with that of a static material rod, and the differences discussed.
In the post Newtonian limit, a non-relativistic Hamiltonian is derived for scalar fields with quartic self-interaction and non-minimal coupling to the curvature scalar of the background spacetime. These effects are found to contribute to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian by adding nonlinearities and by modifying the gravitational Darwin term. As we discuss briefly in the text, the impact of these novel structures can be sizable in dense media like neutron star core, and can have observable signatures in phase transitions, for example.
We analyze the rotation curves of 10 spiral galaxies with a newtonian potential corrected with an extra logarithmic term. The logarithmic correction can have its origin from fundamental frameworks, like string theories or effective models of gravity due to quantum effects. There is also a connection with some toy models resulting from TeVeS. We represent the spiral galaxies as a thin disk. There is a new constant associated with the extra term in the potential. The rotation curve of the chosen sample of spiral galaxies is well reproduced for a narrow range of the new constant. The compatibility of this correction with local physics is discussed.
We show that the splitting feature of the Einstein tensor, as the first term of the Lovelock tensor, into two parts, namely the Ricci tensor and the term proportional to the curvature scalar, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">with</em> the trace relation between them is a common feature of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any</em> other homogeneous terms in the Lovelock tensor. Motivated by the principle of general invariance, we find that this property can be generalized, with the aid of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">generalized trace operator</em> which we define, for any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">inhomogeneous</em> Euler–Lagrange expression that can be spanned linearly in terms of homogeneous tensors. Then, through an application of this generalized trace operator, we demonstrate that the Lovelock tensor analogizes the mathematical form of the Einstein tensor, hence, it represents a generalized Einstein tensor. Finally, we apply this technique to the scalar Gauss–Bonnet gravity as an another version of string–inspired gravity.
We consider a thick brane model using two interacting scalar fields in 7D and 8D gravity. Using a special choice of potential energy, we obtain numerically regular asymptotically flat vacuum solutions. The possibility of obtaining the similar solutions for an arbitrary number of extra spatial dimensions is being estimated.
We derive the five dimensional Myers–Perry metric via an elementary method to solve the vacuum Einstein field equations directly. This method firstly proposed by Clotz is very simple since it merely involves four components of Ricci tensor and only requires us to deal with some equations without second derivatives’ terms when the metric ansatz is assumed to take an appropriate form.
We consider a recently proposed scenario for the generation of primordial cosmological perturbations, the so called Cosmological Slingshot scenario. We first obtain a general expression for the Slingshot primordial power spectrum which extends previous results by including a blue pre-bounce residual contribution at large scales. Starting from this expression we numerically compute the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra arising from the Slingshot scenario and show that they excellently match the standard WMAP 3-year best-fit results. In particular, if the residual blue spectrum is far above the largest WMAP observed scale, the Slingshot primordial spectrum fits the data well by only fixing its amplitude and spectral index at the pivot scale <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> <sub>p</sub> = 10<sup>−3</sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> Mpc<sup>−1</sup>. We finally show that all possible distinctive Slingshot signatures in the CMB power spectra are confined to very low multipoles and thus very hard to detect due to large cosmic variance dominated error bars at these scales.


Bryce DeWitt was one of the great pioneers of quantum gravity. This unpublished lecture gives his recent views on the topic, which we believe will be of great interest not only to researchers involved in modern attempts to quantize Einstein’s theory, but also to a much wider audience. It is the first installment of a book “The Pursuit of Quantum Gravity 1946–2004; Memoirs of Bryce DeWitt” that Cecile DeWitt is preparing. We would like to thank her for the permission to publish this lecture separately in General Relativity and Gravitation. Readers who have unpublished material such as letters from Bryce, and would be willing to send copies to Cecile, are hereby invited to do so. She would be very grateful. G.F.R. Ellis, H. Nicolai (Editors-in-chief).
In 1917, both Einstein and de Sitter proposed a new interpretation of the universe as a whole: the structure of the universe could be described in terms of relativistic field equations. Their contributions marked the beginning of the modern scientific comprehension of the origin and evolution of the universe. Our aim is to propose a critical review paper, based on references in primary sources, on the formulation in 1917 of Einstein’s and de Sitter’s models of the universe, which represents a fundamental chapter in the history of relativistic Cosmology.
We report a method of solving for canonical scalar field exact solution in a non-flat FLRW universe with barotropic fluid using non-linear Schrödinger (NLS)-type formulation in comparison to the method in the standard Friedmann framework. We consider phantom and non-phantom scalar field cases with exponential and power-law accelerating expansion. Analysis on effective equation of state to both cases of expansion is also performed. We speculate and comment on some advantage and disadvantage of using the NLS formulation in solving for the exact solution.
We investigate cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions with both null and non-null electromagnetic fields in the framework of the Brans–Dicke theory and compare these solutions with some of the well-known solutions of general relativity for special values of the parameters of the resulting field functions. We see that, unlike general relativity where the gravitational force of an infinite and charged line mass acting on a test particle is always repulsive, it can be attractive or repulsive for Brans–Dicke theory depending on the values of the parameters as well as the radial distance from the symmetry axis.
It has, quite recently, become fashionable to study a certain class of holographic-inspired models for the dark energy. These investigations have, indeed, managed to make some significant advances towards explaining the empirical data. Nonetheless, surprisingly little thought has been given to conceptual issues such as the composition and the very nature of the implicated energy source. In the current discourse, we attempt to fill this gap by the way of some speculative yet logically self-consistent arguments. Our construction takes us along a path that begins with an entanglement entropy and ends up at a Hubble-sized gas of exotic particles. Moreover, our interpretation of the dark energy turns out to be suggestive of a natural resolution to the cosmic-coincidence problem.
We study the holographic dark energy model in a generalized scalar tensor theory. In a universe filled with cold dark matter and dark energy, the effect of potential of the scalar field is investigated in the equation of state parameter. We show that for a various types of potentials, the equation of state parameter is negative and transition from deceleration to acceleration expansion of the universe is possible.
A novel method is presented which employs advanced numerical techniques used in the engineering sciences to find and study the properties of nontrivial vacua of gauged extended supergravity models. While this method only produces approximate numerical data rather than analytic results, it overcomes the previous limitation of only being able to find vacua with large residual unbroken gauge symmetry groups. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by applying it to the technically most challenging <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> ≥ 3 scalar potential—that of SO(8) × SO(8) gauged <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({({\mathcal N}=16)}\)</span> Chern–Simons Supergravity in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 3. Extensive data on the properties of 99 different vacua (92 of them new) of this model are given. Furthermore, techniques are briefly discussed which should allow using this numerical information as an input to the construction of semi-automatic stringent analytic proofs on the locations and properties of vacua. It hence is argued that these combined techniques presumably are powerful enough to systematically map all the nontrivial vacua of every supergravity model.

A star orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole can be used as a toy model for an educational study of the relativistic effects like bending of light, geodesic precession, and frequency shift. Additionally, the finiteness of the speed of light plays a crucial role for the visual appearance of the star. We will develop an analytic method to show the difference between the actual and the apparent position of the star depending on the observation time and the observer’s inclination to the orbital plane.
We investigate the conditions for which a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional perfect fluid solution is in hydrostatic equilibrium with a cosmological constant. We find a generalization of Buchdahl inequality and obtain an upper bound for the degree of compactification. Using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation to get a lower bound for the degree of compactification we analyse the regions where the solution is in hydrostatic equilibrium. We obtain the inner metric solution and the pressure for the constant fluid density model.
The theory of symmetries of systems of coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODE) is used to develop a concise algorithm in order to obtain the entire space of solutions to vacuum Bianchi Einstein’s field equations (EFEs). The symmetries used are the well known automorphisms of the Lie algebra for the corresponding isometry group of each Bianchi Type, as well as the scaling and the time re-parametrization symmetry. The application of the method to Type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V I I</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> results in (a) obtaining the general solution of Type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V I I</em> <sub>0</sub> with the aid of the third Painlevé transcendental <em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">P</strong></em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I I I</em> </sub>; (b) obtaining the general solution of Type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V I I</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> with the aid of the sixth Painlevé transcendental <em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">P</strong></em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V I</em> </sub>; (c) the recovery of all known solutions (six in total) without a prior assumption of any extra symmetry; (d) The discovery of a <em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">new</strong></em> solution (the line element given in closed form) with a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> <sub>3</sub> isometry group acting on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub>3</sub>, i.e., on time-like hyper-surfaces, along with the emergence of the line element describing the flat vacuum Type <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V I I</em> <sub>0</sub> Bianchi Cosmology.
A model universe is proposed in the framework of 5D noncompact Kaluza–Klein cosmology which is not Ricci flat. The 4D part as the Robertson–Walker metric is coupled to conventional perfect fluid, and its extra-dimensional part is coupled to a dark pressure through a scalar field. It is shown that neither early inflation nor current acceleration of the 4D universe would happen if the nonvacuum states of the scalar field would contribute to 4D cosmology.
The group velocity of gravitational waves in a flat Friedman–Robertson–Walker universe is investigated. For plane waves with wavelength well inside the horizon, and a universe filled with an ideal fluid with the pressure to density ratio less than 1/3, the group velocity is greater than the velocity of light. As a result, a planar pulse of gravitational waves propagating through the universe during the matter/dark energy dominated era arrives to the observer with the peak shifted towards the forefront. For gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling supermassive black holes at the edge of the observable universe, the typical shift that remains after the effects of nonplanarity are suppressed is of order of 10 ps.
Thorne and Kidder give expressions which allow for analytical estimates of the “kick”, i.e. the recoil, produced from asymmetrical gravitational radiation during the interaction of black holes, or in fact any gravitating compact bodies. (The Thorne-Kidder formula uses momentum flux calculations based on the linearized General Relativity of gravitational radiation). We specifically treat kicks arising in the binary interaction of equal mass black holes, when at least one of the black holes has significant spin, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. Such configurations can produce very large kicks in computational simulations. We consider both <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">fly-by</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quasicircular</em> orbits. For fly-by orbits we find substantial kicks from those Thorne-Kidder terms which are linear in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. For the quasi-circular case, we consider in addition the nonlinear contribution (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>2</sup>)) to the kicks, and provide a dynamical explanation for such terms discovered and displayed by [2]. However, in the cases of maximal kick velocities, the dependence on spin is largely linear (reproduced in numerical results [6]).
The observer dependence of the quasi-local energy (QLE) and momentum in the Schwarzschild geometry is illustrated. Using the Brown–York prescription, the QLE for families of non-geodesic and geodesic observers penetrating the event horizon is obtained. An explicit shell-building process is presented and the binding energy is computed in terms of the QLE measured by a static observer field at a radius outside the horizon radius. The QLE for a radially geodesic observer field freely falling from infinity is shown to vanish. Finally, a simple relation for the dynamics of the quasi-local momentum density for a geodesic observer field is noted.
The existence and stability closed timelike curves in a Bonnor–Ward spacetime without torsion line singularities is shown by exhibiting particular examples.

The state of superstring perturbation theory is reviewed with an emphasis on the state of the pure spinor superstring perturbation theory. We begin with a brief summary of the state of perturbation theory in the Ramond–Neveu–Schwarz and in the Green–Schwarz formulations of the superstring. Then we proceed to a quick review of the minimal and non-minimal pure spinor formulations of the superstring and discuss the multi-loop amplitude prescriptions in each of them. We end with a summary and open questions.
A brief overview of loop quantum cosmology of homogeneous isotropic models is presented with emphasis on the origin of and subtleties associated with the resolution of big bang and big crunch singularities. These results bear out the remarkable intuition that John Wheeler had. Discussion is organized at two levels. The the main text provides a bird’s eye view of the subject that should be accessible to non-experts. Appendices address conceptual and technical issues that are often raised by experts in loop quantum gravity and string theory.
We review the status of string theory as a quantum theory of gravity. Our emphasis is on outstanding questions and remaining challenges rather then on well-established results and successes.
Supergravity provides the effective field theories for string compactifications. The deformation of the maximal supergravities by non-abelian gauge interactions is only possible for a restricted class of charges. Generically these ‘gaugings’ involve a hierarchy of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>-form fields which belong to specific representations of the duality group. The group-theoretical structure of this <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>-form hierarchy exhibits many interesting features. In the case of maximal supergravity the class of allowed deformations has intriguing connections with M/string theory.
Wheeler’s Superspace is the arena in which Geometrodynamics takes place. I review some aspects of its geometrical and topological structure that Wheeler urged us to take seriously in the context of canonical quantum gravity.
I review the lattice approach to quantum gravity, and how it relates to the non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point scenario of the continuum theory. After a brief introduction covering the general problem of ultraviolet divergences in gravity and other non-renormalizable theories, I discuss the general methods and goals of the lattice approach. An underlying theme is the attempt at establishing connections between the continuum renormalization group results, which are mainly based on diagrammatic perturbation theory, and the recent lattice results, which apply to the strong gravity regime and are inherently non-perturbative. A second theme in this review is the ever-present natural correspondence between infrared methods of strongly coupled non-abelian gauge theories on the one hand, and the low energy approach to quantum gravity based on the renormalization group and universality of critical behavior on the other. Towards the end of the review I discuss possible observational consequences of path integral quantum gravity, as derived from the non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point scenario. I argue that the theoretical framework naturally leads to considering a weakly scale-dependent Newton’s constant, with a scaling violation parameter related to the observed scaled cosmological constant (and not, as naively expected, to the Planck length).

This brief conference proceeding attempts to explain the implications of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence for black hole entropy in a language accessible to relativists and other non-string theorists. The main conclusion is that the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BH</em> </sub> is the density of states associated with certain superselections sectors, defined by what may be called the algebra of boundary observables. Interestingly while there is a valid context in which this result can be restated as “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BH</em> </sub> counts all states inside the black hole,” there may also be another in which it may be restated as “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BH</em> </sub> does not count all states inside the black hole, but only those that are distinguishable from the outside.” The arguments and conclusions represent the author’s translation of the community’s collective wisdom, combined with a few recent results.
We discuss various approaches to the problem of determining which supersymmetric invariants are permitted as counterterms in maximally supersymmetric super Yang–Mills and supergravity theories in various dimensions. We review the superspace non-renormalisation theorems based on conventional, light-cone, harmonic and certain non-Lorentz covariant superspaces, and we write down explicitly the relevant invariants. While the first two types of superspace admit the possibility of one-half BPS counterterms, of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em> <sup>4</sup> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>4</sup> respectively, the last two do not. This suggests that UV divergences begin with one-quarter BPS counterterms, i.e. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> <sup>2</sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em> <sup>4</sup> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> <sup>4</sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>4</sup>, and this is supported by an entirely different approach based on algebraic renormalisation. The algebraic formalism is discussed for non-renormalisable theories and it is shown how the allowable supersymmetric counterterms can be determined via cohomological methods. These results are in agreement with all the explicit computations that have been carried out to date. In particular, they suggest that maximal supergravity is likely to diverge at four loops in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 5 and at five loops in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 4, unless other infinity suppression mechanisms not involving supersymmetry or gauge invariance are at work.
We discuss various basic conceptual issues related to coarse graining flows in quantum gravity. In particular, the requirement of background independence is shown to lead to renormalization group (RG) flows which are significantly different from their analogs on a rigid background spacetime. The importance of these findings for the asymptotic safety approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is demonstrated in a simplified setting where only the conformal factor is quantized. We identify background independence as a (the?) key prerequisite for the existence of a non-Gaussian RG fixed point and the renormalizability of QEG.
The purpose of this work is to construct asymptotically flat, time symmetric initial data with an apparent horizon of prescribed intrinsic geometry. To do this, we use the parabolic partial differential equation for prescribing scalar curvature. In this equation the horizon geometry is contained within the freely specifiable part of the metric. This contrasts with the conformal method in which the geometry of the horizon can only be specified up to a conformal factor.
In this paper, we investigate dynamics of the modified loop quantum cosmology models using dynamical systems methods. Modifications considered come from the choice of the different field strength operator <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F̂</em> and result in different forms of the effective Hamiltonian. Such an ambiguity of the choice of this expression from some class of functions is allowed in the framework of loop quantization. Our main goal is to show how such modifications can influence the bouncing universe scenario in the loop quantum cosmology. In effective models considered we classify all evolutional paths for all admissible initial conditions. The dynamics is reduced to the form of a dynamical system of the Newtonian type on a two-dimensional phase plane. These models are equivalent dynamically to the FRW models with the decaying effective cosmological term parameterized by the canonical variable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> (or by the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>). We demonstrate that the evolutional scenario depends on the geometrical constant parameter Λ as well as the model parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. We find that for the positive cosmological constant there is a class of oscillating models without the initial and final singularities. The new phenomenon is the appearance of curvature singularities for the finite values of the scale factor, but we find that for the positive cosmological constant these singularities can be avoided. The values of the parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> and the cosmological constant differentiate asymptotic states of the evolution. For the positive cosmological constant the evolution begins at the asymptotic state in the past represented by the de Sitter contracting (deS<sub>−</sub>) spacetime or the static Einstein universe <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> = 0 or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> =  − ∞ state and reaches the de Sitter expanding state (deS<sub>+</sub>), the state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> = 0 or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> =  + ∞ state. In the case of the negative cosmological constant we obtain the past and future asymptotic states as the Einstein static universes.
We investigate thermodynamics for a magnetically charged regular black hole (MCRBH), which comes from the action of general relativity and nonlinear electromagnetics, comparing with the Reissner–Norström (RN) black hole in both four and two dimensions after dimensional reduction. We find that there is no thermodynamic difference between the regular and RN black holes for a fixed charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> in both dimensions. This means that the condition for either singularity or regularity at the origin of coordinate does not affect the thermodynamics of black hole. Furthermore, we describe the near-horizon AdS<sub>2</sub> thermodynamics of the MCRBH with the connection of the Jackiw–Teitelboim theory. We also identify the near-horizon entropy as the statistical entropy by using the AdS<sub>2</sub>/CFT<sub>1</sub> correspondence.
We study pure radiation spacetimes of algebraic types O and N with a possible cosmological constant. In particular, we present explicit transformations which put these metrics, that were recently re-derived by Edgar, Vickers and Machado Ramos, into a general Ozsváth–Robinson–Rózga form. By putting all such metrics into the unified coordinate system we confirm that their derivation based on the GIF formalism is correct. We identify only few trivial differences.
Let Σ be a compact three-manifold with non-positive Yamabe invariant. We prove that in any long time constant mean curvature Einstein flow over Σ, having bounded <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em> <sup>α</sup> space–time curvature at the cosmological scale, the reduced volume <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{V}=(\frac{-k}{3})^{3}{\rm vol}_{g(k)}(\Sigma)}\)</span> [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>) is the evolving spatial three-metric and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> the mean curvature] decays monotonically towards the volume value of the geometrization in which the cosmologically normalized flow decays. In more basic terms, we show that there is volume collapse in the regions where the injectivity radius collapses (i.e. tends to zero) in the long time limit. We conjecture that under the curvature assumption above the Thurston geometrization is the unique global attractor. We prove this in some special cases.
Several recent studies have been devoted to investigating the limitations that standard quantum mechanics and/or quantum gravity might impose on the measurability of space–time observables. These analyses are often confined to the simplified context of 2D flat space–time and rely on a simple procedure for the measurement of space-like distances based on the exchange of light signals. We present a generalization of this measurement procedure applicable to all three types of space–time intervals between two events in space–times of any number of dimensions. We also present a preliminary account of an alternative measurement procedure that can be applied taking into account the gravitational field of the macroscopic measuring apparatus.
A cosmological model for the present Universe is analyzed whose constituents are a non-interacting baryonic matter field and interacting dark matter and dark energy fields. The dark energy and dark matter are coupled through their effective barotropic indexes, which are considered as functions of the ratio of their energy densities. Two asymptotically stable cases are investigated for the ratio of the dark energy densities which have their parameters adjusted by considering best fits to Hubble function data. It is shown that the deceleration parameter, the density parameters, and the luminosity distance have the correct behavior which is expected for a viable present scenario of the Universe.
We argue that the well-known problem of the instabilities that are associated with the self-forces (radiation reaction forces) in classical electrodynamics are possibly stabilized by the introduction of gravitational forces via general relativity.
We propose a mechanism of reheating after inflation in multi-throat scenarios of warped extra dimensions. Validity of an effective field theory on the standard model (SM) brane requires that the position of the SM brane during inflation be different from the position after inflation. The latter is supposed to be near the tip of the SM throat but the former is not. After inflation, when the Hubble expansion rate becomes sufficiently low, the SM brane starts moving towards the tip and eventually oscillates. The SM fields are excited by the brane motion and the universe is reheated. Since interaction between the brane position modulus and the SM fields is suppressed only by the local string scale, the modulus effectively decays into the SM fields.
We propose new brane world models arising from a scalar field in the bulk. In these examples, the induced on-brane line element is de Sitter (or anti de Sitter) and the bulk (five dimensional) Einstein equations can be exactly solved to obtain warped spacetimes. The solutions thus derived are single and two-brane models—one with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">thin</em> branes while the other one of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">thick</em> variety. The field profiles and the potentials are obtained and analysed for each case. We note that for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">thick</em> brane scenario the field profile resembles a kink, whereas for one or more <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">thin</em> branes, it is finite and bounded in the domain of the extra dimension. We have also addressed the localisation of gravity and other matter fields on the brane for these braneworld models.
The mass function of a toroidal black hole as a dynamical variable is given by using Kuchar’s approach. Then the toroidal black hole is investigated by using the de Broglie–Bohm approach, and its quantum potential and quantum trajectories are obtained. In our process the vector potential of the electromagnetic field in the toroidal black hole is treated as a canonical variable.

The gravitational energy–momentum and angular momentum satisfy the algebra of the Poincaré group in the full phase space of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. The expression for the gravitational energy–momentum may be written as a surface integral in the three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface, whereas the definition for the angular momentum is given by a volume integral. It turns out that in practical calculations of the angular momentum of the gravitational field generated by localized sources like rotating neutron stars, the volume integral reduces to a surface integral, and the calculations can be easily carried out. Similar to previous investigations in the literature, we show that the total angular momentum is finite provided a certain asymptotic behaviour is verified. We discuss the dependence of the gravitational angular momentum on the frame, and argue that it is a measure of the dragging of inertial frames.
We evaluate the complex frequencies of the normal modes for the charged scalar field perturbations around a Reissner–Nördstrom black hole surrounded by a static and spherically symmetric quintessence using third order WKB approximation approach. Quintessence decreases the oscillation frequency and increases the damping time of quasinormal frequencies. We studied the variation of quasinormal frequencies with charge of the black bole, mass and charge of perturbing scalar field and the quintessential parameters.
Tachyon-brane inflationary universe model in the context of a Chaplygin gas equation of state is studied. General conditions for this model to be realizable are discussed. In the high-energy limit and by using an exponential potential we describe in great details the characteristic of this model. Recent observational data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe experiment are employed to restrict the parameters of the model.
In this paper, we preliminarily explore the possibility of designing a dedicated satellite-based mission to measure the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense–Thirring effect in the gravitational field of Mars. The focus is on the systematic uncertainty induced by the multipolar expansion of the areopotential and on possible strategies to reduce it. It turns out that the major sources of bias are the Mars’equatorial radius <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and the even zonal harmonics <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>ℓ</sub>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em> = 2, 4, 6, . . . of the areopotential. An optimal solution, in principle, consists of using two probes at high-altitudes (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> ≈ 9,500–9,600 km) and different inclinations (one probe should fly in a nearly polar orbit), and suitably combining their nodes in order to entirely cancel out the bias due to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. The remaining uncancelled mismodelled terms due to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>ℓ</sub>, ℓ = 2, 4, 6, . . . would induce a bias ≲ 1%, according to the present-day MGS95J gravity model, over a wide range of admissible values of the inclinations. The Lense–Thirring out-of-plane shifts of the two probes would amount to about 10 cm year<sup>−1</sup>.
Starting out with the balance equations for energy-momentum, spin, particle and entropy density, an approach is considered which represents a framework for special- and general-relativistic continuum thermodynamics. A general entropy density 4-vector, containing particle, energy-momentum, and spin density contributions, is introduced. This makes possible, firstly, to test special entropy density 4-vectors used by other authors with respect to their generality and validity and, secondly, to determine entropy supply and entropy production. Using this entropy density 4-vector, material-independent equilibrium conditions are discussed. While in literature, generally thermodynamic equilibrium is determined by introducing a variety of conditions by hand, the present approach proceeds as follows: For a comparatively wide class of space–time geometries, the necessary equilibrium conditions of vanishing entropy supply and vanishing entropy production are exploited. Because these necessary equilibrium conditions do not determine the equilibrium, supplementary conditions are added systematically motivated by the requirement that also all parts of the necessary conditions have to be fixed in equilibrium.
Rotating black holes in the brany universe of the Randall–Sundrum type with infinite additional dimension are described by the Kerr geometry with a tidal charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> representing the interaction of the brany black hole and the bulk spacetime. For <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &lt; 0 rotating black holes with dimensionless spin <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> &gt; 1 are allowed. We investigate the role of the tidal charge in the orbital resonance model of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole systems. The orbital Keplerian frequency <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>K</sub> and the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>r</sub>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> </sub> of the equatorial, quasicircular geodetical motion are given. Their radial profiles related to Keplerian accretion discs are discussed, assuming the inner edge of the disc located at the innermost stable circular geodesic. For completeness, naked singularity spacetimes are considered too. The resonant conditions are given in three astrophysically relevant situations: for direct (parametric) resonances of the oscillations with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, for the relativistic precession model, and for some trapped oscillations of the warped discs, with resonant combinational frequencies involving the Keplerian and radial epicyclic frequencies. It is shown, how the tidal charge could influence matching of the observational data indicating the 3 : 2 frequency ratio observed in GRS 1915 + 105 microquasar with prediction of the orbital resonance model; limits on allowed range of the black hole parameters <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> are established. The “magic” dimensionless black hole spin enabling presence of strong resonant phenomena at the radius, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>K</sub>: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> </sub> : <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>r</sub> = 3 : 2 : 1, is determined in dependence on the tidal charge. Such strong resonances could be relevant even in sources with highly scattered resonant frequencies, as those expected in Sgr A*. The specific values of the spin and tidal charge are given also for existence of specific radius where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>K</sub> : <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> </sub> : <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sub>r</sub> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> : <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> : <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> with 5≥<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> &gt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> &gt;<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> being small natural numbers. It is shown that for some ratios such situation is impossible in the field of black holes. We can conclude that analysing the microquasars high-frequency QPOs in the framework of orbital resonance models, we can put relevant limits on the tidal charge of brany Kerr black holes.
Within all approaches to quantum gravity small violations of the Einstein Equivalence Principle are expected. This includes violations of Lorentz invariance. While usually violations of Lorentz invariance are introduced through the coupling to additional tensor fields, here a Finslerian approach is employed where violations of Lorentz invariance are incorporated as an integral part of the space–time metrics. Within such a Finslerian framework a modified dispersion relation is derived which is confronted with current high precision experiments. As a result, Finsler type deviations from the Minkowskian metric are excluded with an accuracy of 10<sup>−16</sup>.
We consider Einstein gravity coupled to an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) gauge field for which the density is given by a power of the Maxwell Lagrangian. In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensions the action of Maxwell field is shown to enjoy the conformal invariance if the power is chosen as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>/4. We present a class of charge rotating solutions in Einstein-conformally invariant Maxwell gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant. These solutions may be interpreted as black brane solutions with inner and outer event horizons or an extreme black brane depending on the value of the mass parameter. Since we are considering power of the Maxwell density, the black brane solutions exist only for dimensions which are multiples of four. We compute conserved and thermodynamics quantities of the black brane solutions and show that the expression of the electric field does not depend on the dimension. Also, we obtain a Smarr-type formula and show that these conserved and thermodynamic quantities of black branes satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we study the phase behavior of the rotating black branes and show that there is no Hawking–Page phase transition in spite of conformally invariant Maxwell field.
Generalising expressions given by Komar, we give precise definitions of gravitational mass and solitonic NUT charge and we apply these to the description of a class of Minkowski-signature multi-Taub–NUT solutions without rod singularities. A Wick rotation then yields the corresponding class of Euclidean-signature gravitational multi-instantons.
Maitra’s shearing, rotating cylindrical dust solution is fitted to a vacuum exterior. There are no closed timelike curves in the interior or exterior.
We study the generation of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background produced by a population of neutron stars (NSs) which go over a hadron-quark phase transition in its inner shells. We obtain, for example, that the NS phase transition, in cold dark matter scenarios, could generate a stochastic GW background with a maximum amplitude of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> <sub>BG</sub> ~ 10<sup>−24</sup>, in the frequency band <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em> <sub>obs</sub> ≃ 20–2,000 Hz for stars forming at redshifts of up to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> ≃ 20. We study the possibility of detection of this isotropic GW background by correlating signals of a pair of Advanced LIGO observatories.
We develop the kinematics in Matrix Gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity obtained by a non-commutative deformation of General Relativity. In this model the usual interpretation of gravity as Riemannian geometry is replaced by a new kind of geometry, which is equivalent to a collection of Finsler geometries with several Finsler metrics depending both on the position and on the velocity. As a result the Riemannian geodesic flow is replaced by a collection of Finsler flows. This naturally leads to a model in which a particle is described by several mass parameters. If these mass parameters are different then the equivalence principle is violated. In the non-relativistic limit this also leads to corrections to the Newton’s gravitational potential. We find the first and second order corrections to the usual Riemannian geodesic flow and evaluate the anomalous nongeodesic acceleration in a particular case of static spherically symmetric background.
Roy P. Kerr has discovered his celebrated metric 45 years ago, yet the problem to find a generalization of the Schwarzschild metric for a rotating mass was faced much earlier. Lense and Thirring, Bach, Andress, Akeley, Lewis, van Stockum and others have tried to solve it or to find an approximative solution at least. In particular Achilles Papapetrou, from 1952 to 1961 in Berlin, was interested in an exact solution. He directed the author in the late autumn of 1959 to work on the problem. Why did these pre-Kerr attempts fail? Comments based on personal reminiscences and old notes.

We present the exact solution of Einstein’s equation corresponding to a static and plane symmetric distribution of matter with constant positive density located below <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 0. This solution depends essentially on two constants: the density <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> and a parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>. We show that these space–times finish down below at an inner singularity at finite depth. We show that for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em> ≥ 0.3513 . . . the dominant energy condition is satisfied all over the space–time. We match this solution to the vacuum one and compute the external gravitational field in terms of slab’s parameters. Depending on the value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>, these slabs can be attractive, repulsive or neutral. In the first case, the space–time also finishes up above at an empty repelling singular boundary. In the other cases, they turn out to be semi-infinite and asymptotically flat when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> → ∞. We also find solutions consisting of joining an attractive slab and a repulsive one, and two neutral ones. We also discuss how to assemble a “gravitational capacitor” by inserting a slice of vacuum between two such slabs.
In some well-known scenarios of open-universe eternal inflation, developed by Vilenkin and co-workers, a large number of universes nucleate and thermalize within the eternally inflating mega-universe. According to the proposal, each universe nucleates at a point, and therefore the boundary of the nucleated universe is a space-like surface nearly coincident with the future light cone emanating from the point of nucleation, all points of which have the same proper-time. This leads the authors to conclude that at the proper-time <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>  =  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> <sub>nuc</sub> at which any such nucleation occurs, an infinite open universe comes into existence. We point out that this is due entirely to the supposition of the nucleation occurring at a single point, which in light of quantum cosmology seems difficult to support. Even an infinitesimal space-like length at the moment of nucleation gives a rather different result—the boundary of the nucleating universe evolves in proper time and becomes infinite only in an infinite time. The alleged infinity is never attained at any finite time.
This paper discusses a new variable equation of state parameter leading to exact solutions of the Einstein field equations describing traversable wormholes. In addition to generalizing the notion of phantom energy, the equation of state generates a mathematical model that combines the generalized phantom energy and the generalized Chaplygin gas models.
We investigate gravitational lensing in the Palatini approach to the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) extended theories of gravity. Starting from an exact solution of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) field equations, which corresponds to the Schwarzschild–de Sitter metric and, on the basis of recent studies on this metric, we focus on some lensing observables, in order to evaluate the effects of the nonlinearity of the gravity Lagrangian. We give estimates for some astrophysical events, and show that these effects are tiny for galactic lenses, but become interesting for extragalactic ones.
Smooth double crossing of the phantom barrier <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>Λ</sub> = − 1 has been found possible in cosmological model with Gauss–Bonnet-scalar interaction, in the presence of background cold dark matter. Such crossing has been observed to be a sufficiently late time phenomena and independent of the sign of Gauss–Bonnet-scalar interaction. The luminosity distance versus redshift curve shows a perfect fit with the Λ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">CDM</em> model up to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 3.5.
The reconstruction of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity is showed by using an auxiliary scalar field in the context of cosmological evolution, this development provides a way to reconstruct the form of the function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) for a given evolution of the Hubble parameter. In analogy, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity may be expressed by a perfect fluid with an inhomogeneous equation of state (EoS) that depends on the Hubble parameter and its derivatives. This mathematical equivalence that may confuse about the origin of the mechanism that produces the current acceleration, and possibly the whole evolution of the Hubble parameter, is shown here.
We investigate whether black holes can be defined without using event horizons. In particular we focus on the thermodynamic properties of event horizons and the alternative, locally defined horizons. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of the proofs of the zeroth, first and second laws of black hole mechanics for both event horizons and trapping horizons. This leads to the possibility that black holes may be more usefully defined in terms of trapping horizons. We also review how Hawking radiation may be seen to arise from trapping horizons and discuss which horizon area should be associated with the gravitational entropy.
This paper considers volume averaging in the quasispherical Szekeres model. The volume averaging became of considerable interest after it was shown that the volume acceleration calculated within the averaging framework can be positive even when the local expansion rate decelerates. This issue was intensively studied within spherically symmetric models. However, since our Universe is not spherically symmetric similar analysis is needed in non-symmetrical models. This papers presents the averaging analysis within the quasispherical Szekeres model which is a non-symmetrical generalisation of the spherically symmetric Lemaître–Tolman family of models. In the quasispherical Szekeres model the distribution of mass over a surface of constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> has the form of a mass-dipole superposed on a monopole. This paper shows that when calculating the volume acceleration, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ä</em>, within the Szekeres model, the dipole does not contribute to the final result, hence <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ä</em> only depends on a monopole configuration. Thus, the volume averaging within the Szekeres model leads to literally the same solutions as those obtained within the Lemaître–Tolman model.
We analyse strong lensing in the Einstein–Straus solution with positive cosmological constant. Our result confirms Rindler and Ishak’s finding that a positive cosmological constant decreases the bending of light by an isolated spherical mass. In agreement with an analysis by Ishak et al., this decrease is found to be attenuated by a homogeneous mass distribution added around the spherical mass and by a recession of the observer. For concreteness we compare the theory to the light deflection of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112.
In the spacetime of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional static tense brane black hole we elaborate the mechanism by which massive scalar fields decay. The metric of a six-dimensional black hole pierced by a topological defect is especially interesting. It corresponds to a black hole residing on a tensional 3-brane embedded in a six-dimensional spacetime, and this solution has gained importance due to the planned accelerator experiments. It happened that the intermediate asymptotic behaviour of the fields in question was determined by an oscillatory inverse power-law. We confirm our investigations by numerical calculations for five- and six-dimensional cases. It turned out that the greater the brane tension is, the faster massive scalar field decay in the considered spacetimes.
Heller et al. (J Math Phys 46:122501, 2005; Int J Theor Phys 46:2494, 2007) proposed a model unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics based on a noncommutative algebra <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{A}}\)</span> defined on a groupoid having the frame bundle over space–time as its base space. The generalized Einstein equation is assumed in the form of the eigenvalue equation of the Einstein operator on a module of derivations of the algebra <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathcal{A}}\)</span> . No matter sources are assumed. The closed Friedman world model, when computed in this formalism, exhibits two interesting properties. First, generalized eigenvalues of the Einstein operator reproduce components of the perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor for the usual Friedman model together with the corresponding equation of state. One could say that, in this case, matter is produced out of pure (noncommutative) geometry. Second, owing to probabilistic properties of the model, in the noncommutative regime (on the Planck level) singularities are irrelevant. They emerge in the process of transition to the usual space–time geometry. These results are briefly discussed.
Here, we examine hole-freeness—a condition sometimes imposed to rule out seemingly artificial spacetimes. We show that under existing definitions (and contrary to claims made in the literature) there exist inextendible, globally hyperbolic spacetimes which fail to be hole-free. We then propose an updated formulation of the condition which enables us to show the intended result.
It is shown that the so-called generic instabilities that appear in the framework of relativistic linear irreversible thermodynamics (LIT), describing the fluctuations of a simple fluid close to equilibrium, arise due to the coupling of heat with hydrodynamic acceleration which appears in Eckart’s formalism of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics. Further, we emphasize that such behavior should be interpreted as a contradiction to the postulates of LIT, namely a violation of Onsager’s hypothesis on the regression of fluctuations, and not as fluid instabilities. Such contradictions can be avoided within a relativistic linear framework if a Meixner-like approach to the phenomenological equations is employed.

This English translation of the paper by H. Weyl, “Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie”, Physikalische Zeitschrift <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">24</strong>, 230–232 (1923), in which he formulated the geometrical foundations of a model of an expanding Universe, has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal.

In this paper a more general phenomenological model is proposed on the basis of the Hobbit model in Cardone et al. (Phys Rev D 69:083517, 2004). The main purpose of constructing our model is to make this model can not only mimic the ΛCDM model, but also describe a four-phase smooth transition of the universe, namely the inflationary phase, a radiation-dominated phase, a matter-dominated phase and a de Sitter-like phase. In order to check whether this model is a viable one, the evolutions of the universe are respectively discussed in the two cases, and the possible physical interpretations for this model are also respectively shown by using the scalar fields. Finally, the structure formations in our model are simply discussed for the both cases, and the results given by us reconfirm that our model can be regarded as a fit to the ΛCDM model, if we choose the proper conditions.
The Bel–Robinson tensor is analyzed as a linear map on the space of the traceless symmetric tensors. This study leads to an algebraic classification that refines the usual Petrov–Bel classification of the Weyl tensor. The new classes correspond to degenerate type I space-times which have already been introduced in literature from another point of view. The Petrov–Bel types and the additional ones are intrinsically characterized in terms of the sole Bel–Robinson tensor, and an algorithm is proposed that enables the different classes to be distinguished. Results are presented that solve the problem of obtaining the Weyl tensor from the Bel–Robinson tensor in regular cases.
After the approval by the Italian Space Agency of the LARES satellite, which should be launched at the end of 2009 with a VEGA rocket and whose claimed goal is a ≈1% measurement of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense–Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the Earth, it is of the utmost importance to reliably assess the total realistic accuracy that can be reached by such a mission. The observable is a linear combination of the nodes of the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites and of LARES able to cancel out the impact of the first two even zonal harmonic coefficients of the multipolar expansion of the classical part of the terrestrial gravitational potential representing a major source of systematic error. While LAGEOS and LAGEOS II fly at altitudes of about 6,000 km, LARES should be placed at an altitude of 1,450 km. Thus, it will be sensitive to much more even zonals than LAGEOS and LAGEOS II. Their corrupting impact has been evaluated up to degree <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em> = 70 by using the sigmas of the covariance matrices of eight different global gravity solutions (EIGEN-GRACE02S, EIGEN-CG03C, GGM02S, GGM03S, JEM01-RL03B, ITG-Grace02s, ITG-Grace03, EGM2008) obtained by five institutions (GFZ, CSR, JPL, IGG, NGA) with different techniques from long data sets of the dedicated GRACE missions. It turns out to be ≈100–1,000% of the Lense–Thirring effect. An improvement of 2–3 orders of magnitude in the determination of the high degree even zonals would be required to constrain the bias to ≈1–10%.
The standard procedure for finding analytic perturbations in General Relativity suffers from the drawback that it is cumbersome to use beyond linear order perturbations. Following up on our previous work, we continue to use an alternate method of finding perturbations. We find a plane symmetric perturbation of the cosmological Bianchi type I metric. The perturbation corresponds to a fluid with heat flow moving perpendicularly to a singular plane in a region which can be made to be either overdense or underdense relative to the background spacetime. The fluid satisfies both the Strong and Dominant energy conditions everywhere except the region close to the singularity.
This paper presents the application of the Szekeres Swiss Cheese model to the analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The impact of inhomogeneous matter distribution on the CMB observations is in most cases studied within the linear perturbations of the Friedmann model. However, since the density contrast and the Weyl curvature within the cosmic structures are large, this issue is worth studying using another approach. The Szekeres model is an inhomogeneous, non-symmetrical and exact solution of the Einstein equations. In this model, light propagation and matter evolution can be exactly calculated, without such approximations as small amplitude of the density contrast. This allows to examine in more realistic manner the contribution of the light propagation effect to the measured CMB temperature fluctuations. The results of such analysis show that small-scale, non-linear inhomogeneities induce, via Rees-Sciama effect, temperature fluctuations of amplitude 10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−5</sup> on angular scale <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ϑ</em> &lt; 0.24° (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em> &gt; 750). This is still much smaller than the measured temperature fluctuations on this angular scale. However, local and uncompensated inhomogeneities can induce temperature fluctuations of amplitude as large as 10<sup>−3</sup>, and thus can be responsible the low multipoles anomalies observed in the angular CMB power spectrum.
Building on earlier work, we discuss a general framework for exploring the cosmological dynamics of Higher Order Theories of Gravity. We show that once the theory of gravity has been specified, the cosmological equations can be written as a first-order autonomous system and we give several examples which illustrate the utility of our method. We also discuss a number of results which have appeared recently in the literature.
Cosmological singularity and asymptotic behavior of scale factor of generalized cosmological models are analyzed in respect of their structural stability. It is shown, that cosmological singularity is structurally unstable for the majority of models with barotropic perfect fluid with strong energy condition. Inclusion of Λ-term extends the set of structurally stable cosmological models.
In the framework of the braneworld models, rotating black holes can be described by the Kerr metric with a tidal charge representing the influence of the non-local gravitational (tidal) effects of the bulk space Weyl tensor onto the black hole spacetime. We study the influence of the tidal charge onto profiled spectral lines generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of the black hole, the profiled line becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the profiled line. The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the profiled lines due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind the black hole. For positive tidal charge (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &gt; 0) and high inclination angles two small humps appear in the profiled lines close to the red and blue edge of the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>, the strongest effect on the profiled lines shape (extension) is caused by the changes of the inclination angle.
A local classification of spacelike surfaces in Minkowski 4-space, which are invariant under spacelike rotations, and with mean curvature vector either vanishing or lightlike, is obtained. Furthermore, the existence of such surfaces with prescribed Gaussian curvature is shown. A procedure is presented to glue several of these surfaces with intermediate parts where the mean curvature vector field vanishes. In particular, a local description of marginally trapped surfaces invariant under spacelike rotations is exhibited.
We have constructed star models consisting of four parts: (i) a homogeneous inner core with anisotropic pressure (ii) an infinitesimal thin shell separating the core and the envelope; (iii) an envelope of inhomogeneous density and isotropic pressure; (iv) an infinitesimal thin shell matching the envelope boundary and the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. We have analyzed all the energy conditions for the core, envelope and the two thin shells. We have found that, in order to have static solutions, at least one of the regions must be constituted by dark energy. The results show that there is no physical reason to have a superior limit for the mass of these objects but for the ratio of mass and radius.
A new class of solutions which yields an (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 1)-dimensional spacetime with a longitudinal nonlinear magnetic field is introduced. These spacetimes have no curvature singularity and no horizon, and the magnetic field is non singular in the whole spacetime. They may be interpreted as traversable wormholes which could be supported by matter not violating the weak energy conditions. We generalize this class of solutions to the case of rotating solutions and show that the rotating wormhole solutions have a net electric charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameter, while the static wormhole has no net electric charge. Finally, we use the counterterm method and compute the conserved quantities of these spacetimes.
The Lambda-renormalized Einstein–Schrödinger theory is a modification of the original Einstein–Schrödinger theory in which a cosmological constant term is added to the Lagrangian, and it has been shown to closely approximate Einstein– Maxwell theory. Here we generalize this theory to non-Abelian fields by letting the fields be composed of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> Hermitian matrices. The resulting theory incorporates the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>) gauge terms of Einstein–Maxwell–Yang–Mills theory, and is invariant under <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>) gauge transformations. The special case where symmetric fields are multiples of the identity matrix closely approximates Einstein–Maxwell–Yang–Mills theory in that the extra terms in the field equations are &lt; 10<sup>−13</sup> of the usual terms for worst-case fields accessible to measurement. The theory contains a symmetric metric and Hermitian vector potential, and is easily coupled to the additional fields of Weinberg–Salam theory or flipped <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(5) GUT theory. We also consider the case where symmetric fields have small traceless parts, and show how this suggests a possible dark matter candidate.
Recent researches on the Hawking radiation of black holes show that the Hawking temperature can be obtained by fermion tunnelling method. In this paper, we extend this method to a 5-D space-time and view the Hawking radiation of the Myers–Perry black hole with two independent angular momenta. As a result, the Hawking temperature is obtained, which is the same as that obtained by other methods.

In this note we wish to complement some recent work in the cosmological literature concerning the Weyl conformal curvature tensor and its parts. In particular, we shall give a clear-cut definition of the Newtonian limits of electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor. We also discuss that only a subset of the relativistic equations is needed to obtain a closed system of equations in the Newtonian limit.



The existence of a torsion background in spacetime at cosmological scales can be tested from the timing of high-energy photons from AGN. The observations of anomalous photon dispersion from Markarian 501 by Magic gamma ray telescope can be explained by the presence of torsion background and it puts limits on the torsion background at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ S</em> <sub>0</sub> &lt; 10<sup>−18</sup> GeV<sup>−1</sup>.
The principle part of Einstein equations in the harmonic gauge consists of a constrained system of 10 curved space wave equations for the components of the space-time metric. A well-posed initial boundary value problem based upon a new formulation of constraint-preserving boundary conditions of the Sommerfeld type has recently been established for such systems. In this paper these boundary conditions are recast in a geometric form. This serves as a first step toward their application to other metric formulations of Einstein’s equations.
There is a precise sense in which the requirement of background independence suffices to uniquely select the kinematics of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Specifically, the fundamental kinematic algebra of LQG admits a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unique</em> diffeomorphism invariant state. Although this result has been established rigorously, it comes as a surprise to researchers working with other approaches to quantum gravity. The goal of this article is to explain the underlying reasons in a pedagogical fashion using geometrodynamics, keeping the technicalities at their minimum. This discussion will bring out the surprisingly powerful role played by diffeomorphism invariance (and covariance) in non-perturbative, canonical quantum gravity.

While there exist now formulations of initial boundary value problems for Einstein’s field equations which are well posed and preserve constraints and gauge conditions, the question of geometric uniqueness remains unresolved. For two different approaches we discuss how this difficulty arises under general assumptions. So far it is not known whether it can be overcome without imposing conditions on the geometry of the boundary. We point out a natural and important class of initial boundary value problems which may offer possibilities to arrive at a fully covariant formulation.
This article—written in honour of Jürgen Ehlers—consists of two different, though interlocking parts: Sect. 1 describes my 54 years of perpetual experiences and exchanges with him, both science and episodes, whilst Sect. 2 describes the history of astrophysical black holes, which evolved during the same epoque though largely independently, with its activity centers in other places of the globe, and has by no means terminated.
Various aspects of the C-metric representing two rotating charged black holes accelerated in opposite directions are summarized and its limits are considered. A particular attention is paid to the special-relativistic limit in which the electromagnetic field becomes the “magic field” of two oppositely accelerated rotating charged relativistic discs. When the acceleration vanishes the usual electromagnetic magic field of the Kerr–Newman black hole with gravitational constant set to zero arises. Properties of the accelerated discs and the fields produced are studied and illustrated graphically. The charges at the rim of the accelerated discs move along spiral trajectories with the speed of light. If the magic field has some deeper connection with the field of the Dirac electron, as is sometimes conjectured because of the same gyromagnetic ratio, the “accelerating magic field” represents the electromagnetic field of a uniformly accelerated spinning electron. It generalizes the classical Born’s solution for two uniformly accelerated monopole charges.
The Newtonian limit of general relativity was Jürgen Ehlers favourite model for limit relations between theories of physics. In this contribution, for the case of isolated systems, the Newtonian limit of general relativity will be illuminated from a canonical dynamics point of view. The canonical dynamics approach naturally supplies a post-Newtonian expansion of general relativity.
The thoughts expressed in this article are based on remarks made by Jürgen Ehlers at the Albert-Einstein-Institut, Golm, Germany in July 2007. The main objective of this article is to demonstrate, in terms of plausible order-of-magnitude estimates for geometrical scalars, the relevance of spatial curvature in realistic models of the Universe that describe the dynamics of structure formation since the epoch of matter–radiation decoupling. We introduce these estimates with a commentary on the use of a quasi-Newtonian metric form in this context.
We construct solutions, for small values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and angular frequency Ω, of special relativistic scalar gravity coupled to ideally elastic matter which have helical but no stationary or axial symmetry. They correspond to a body without any symmetries in steady rotation around one of its axes of inertia, or two bodies moving on a circle around their center of gravity. Our construction is rigorous, but modulo an unproved conjecture on the differentiability of a certain functional.
The Euler–Poisson–Darboux (EPD) equation is the simplest linear hyperbolic equation in two independent variables whose coefficients exhibit singularities, and as such must be of interest as a paradigm to relativists. Sadly it receives scant treatment in the textbooks. The first half of this review is didactic in nature. It discusses in the simplest terms possible the nature of solutions of the EPD equation for the timelike and spacelike singularity cases. Also covered is the Riemann representation of solutions of the characteristic initial value problem, which is hard to find in the literature. The second half examines a few of the possible applications, ranging from explicit computation of the leading terms in the far-field backscatter from predominantly outgoing radiation in a Schwarzschild space–time, to computing explicitly the leading terms in the matter-induced singularities in plane symmetric space–times. There are of course many other applications and the aim of this article is to encourage relativists to investigate this underrated paradigm.
The paper starts with the proposal that the cause of the apparent insolubility of the free-will problem are several popular but strongly metaphysical notions and hypotheses. To reduce the metaphysics, some ideas are borrowed from physics. A concept of event causality is discussed. The importance of Hume’s Principle of Causality is stressed and his Principle of Causation is weakened. The key concept of the paper, the so-called relative freedom, is also suggested by physics. It is a kind of freedom that can be observed everywhere in nature. Turning to biology, incomplete knowledge is defined for all organisms. They cope with the problem by Popper’s trial and error processes. One source of their success is the relative freedom of choice from the basic option ranges: mutations, motions and neural connections. Finally, the conjecture is adopted that communicability can be used as a criterion of consciousness and free will is defined as a conscious version of relative freedom. The resulting notion is logically self-consistent and it describes an observable phenomenon that agrees with our experience.
Jürgen Ehlers developed <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">frame theory</em> to better understand the relationship between general relativity and Newtonian gravity. Frame theory contains a parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em>, which can be thought of as 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sup>2</sup>, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> is the speed of light. By construction, frame theory is equivalent to general relativity for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> &gt; 0, and reduces to Newtonian gravity for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> = 0. Moreover, by setting <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\epsilon=\sqrt{\lambda}}\)</span> , frame theory provides a framework to study the Newtonian limit <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\epsilon \searrow 0 \,{\rm (i.e.}\, c\rightarrow \infty)}\)</span>. A number of ideas relating to frame theory that were introduced by Jürgen have subsequently found important applications to the rigorous study of both the Newtonian limit and post-Newtonian expansions. In this article, we review frame theory and discuss, in a non-technical fashion, some of the rigorous results on the Newtonian limit and post-Newtonian expansions that have followed from Jürgen’s work.
We resume former discussions of the question, whether the spin–spin repulsion and the gravitational attraction of two aligned black holes can balance each other. To answer the question we formulate a boundary value problem for two separate (Killing-) horizons and apply the inverse (scattering) method to solve it. Making use of results of Manko, Ruiz and Sanabria-Gómez and a novel black hole criterion, we prove the non-existence of the equilibrium situation in question.
The success of the moving puncture method for the numerical simulation of black hole systems can be partially explained by the properties of stationary solutions of the 1 + log coordinate condition. We compute stationary 1 + log slices of the Schwarzschild spacetime in isotropic coordinates in order to investigate the coordinate singularity that the numerical methods have to handle at the puncture. We present an alternative integration method to obtain isotropic coordinates that simplifies numerical integration and that gives direct access to a local expansion in the isotropic radius near the puncture. Numerical results have shown that certain quantities are well approximated by a function linear in the isotropic radius near the puncture, while here we show that in some cases the isotropic radius appears with an exponent that is close to but unequal to one.
Are natural scientists gaining an ever more complete picture of reality through their objective insights, or are the truths of the natural sciences no more than consensuses that change with time? The astrophysicist <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Jürgen Ehlers</strong> and the social scientist <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Rudolf Stichweh</strong> talk to Spektrum.
We present the tensor computer algebra package <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">xPert</em> for fast construction and manipulation of the equations of metric perturbation theory, around arbitrary backgrounds. It is based on the combination of explicit combinatorial formulas for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>th order perturbation of curvature tensors and their gauge changes, and the use of highly efficient techniques of index canonicalization, provided by the underlying tensor system <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">xAct</em>, for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mathematica</em>. We give examples of use and show the efficiency of the system with timings plots: it is possible to handle orders <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 4 or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 5 within seconds, or reach <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 10 with timings below 1 h.
Kerner and Mann’s recent research shows that the Hawking temperature and tunneling rate can be obtained by the fermion tunneling method from the Rindler space-time and a general non-rotating black hole. In this paper, considering the tunneling particles with spin 1/2 and taking into account the particle’s self-gravitation in the dynamical background space-time, we further improve Kerner and Man’s fermion tunneling method to investigate Hawking radiation via tunneling from a non-static black hole with the internal global monopole. The result shows that the tunneling rate of the non-static black hole is related to the integral of the changing horizon besides the change of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy, which is different from the stationary cases. It also essentially implies that the unitary is violated for the reason that the black hole is non-stationary and cannot be treated as an isolated system.
Analyzing exact solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations in the Kerr–Schild formalism we show that black hole horizon is instable with respect to electromagnetic excitations. Contrary to perturbative smooth harmonic solutions, the exact solutions for electromagnetic excitations on the Kerr background are accompanied by singular beams which have very strong back reaction to metric and break the horizon, forming the holes which allow radiation to escape interior of black-hole. As a result, even the weak vacuum fluctuations break the horizon topologically, covering it by a set of fluctuating microholes. We conclude with a series of nontrivial consequences, one of which is that there is no information loss inside of black-hole.
Standard cosmology poses a number of important questions. Apart from its singular origin, it possesses early and late accelerating phases required to account for observations. The vacuum energy has been considered as a possible way to resolve some of these questions. The vacuum energy density induced by free fields in an early de Sitter phase has earlier been estimated to be proportional to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sup>4</sup>, while more recently it has been suggested that the QCD condensate induces a term proportional to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> at late times. These results have been employed in models which are non-singular and inflationary at early times and accelerating at late times. Here we cast these models in terms of scalar fields and study the corresponding spectrum of primordial perturbations. At early times the spectrum is found to be not scale-invariant, thus implying that slow-roll inflation is still required after the phase transition induced by the vacuum. At late times the corresponding scalar-field potential is harmonic, with a mass of the order of the Hubble scale, a result that may be understood in the light of the holographic conjecture.
The anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence implies that small perturbations of a black hole correspond to small deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium in a dual field theory. For gauge theories with an Einstein gravity dual, the AdS/CFT correspondence predicts a universal value for the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η/s</em> = 1/4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>. It was conjectured recently that all fluids conform to the lower bound <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η/s</em> ≥ 1/4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>. This <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conjectured</em> bound has been the focus of much recent attention. However, despite the flurry of research in this field we still lack a proof for the general validity of the bound. In this essay we show that this mysterious bound is actually a direct outcome of the interplay between gravity, quantum theory, and thermodynamics.
Inflationary cosmology has proved to be the most successful at predicting the properties of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this essay we show that quantum field renormalization significantly influences the generation of primordial perturbations and hence the expected measurable imprint of cosmological inflation on the CMB. However, the new predictions remain in agreement with observation, and in fact favor the simplest forms of inflation. In the near future, observations of the influence of gravitational waves from the early universe on the CMB will test our new predictions.
The existence of a thermodynamic description of horizons indicates that spacetime has a microstructure. While the “fundamental” degrees of freedom remain elusive, quantizing Einstein’s gravity provides some clues about their properties. A quantum AdS black hole possesses an equispaced mass spectrum, independent of Newton’s constant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, when its horizon radius is large compared to the AdS length. Moreover, the black hole’s thermodynamics in this limit is inextricably connected with its thermodynamics in the opposite (Schwarzschild) limit by a duality of the Bose partition function. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>, absent in the mass spectrum, reemerges in the thermodynamic description through the Schwarzschild limit, which should be viewed as a natural “ground state”. It seems that the Hawking-Page phase transition separates fundamental, “particle-like” degrees of freedom from effective, “geometric” ones.
We analyze seven different viable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravities towards the Solar System tests and stochastic gravitational waves background. The aim is to achieve experimental bounds for the theory at local and cosmological scales in order to select models capable of addressing the accelerating cosmological expansion without cosmological constant but evading the weak field constraints. Beside large scale structure and galactic dynamics, these bounds can be considered complimentary in order to select self-consistent theories of gravity working at the infrared limit. It is demonstrated that seven viable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravities under consideration not only satisfy the local tests, but additionally, pass the above PPN-and stochastic gravitational waves bounds for large classes of parameters.
We investigate the generation of gravitational waves in power-law inflationary models. The energy spectrum of the gravitational waves is calculated using the method of continuous Bogoliubov coefficients. We show that, by looking at the interval of frequencies between 10<sup>−5</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> Hz and also at the GHz range, important information can be obtained, both about the inflationary period itself and about the thermalization regime between the end of inflation and the beginning of the radiation-dominated era. We thus deem the development of gravitational wave detectors, covering the MHz/GHz range of frequencies, to be an important task for the future.
Generalized symmetries of the gravitational field equations are used to demonstrate that the average value of the cosmological term decreases rapidly to zero after the inflationary epoch.
There is much attention on the corrections to Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in area with a model-dependent coefficient. The corrections are generally composed of two parts: quantum corrections and thermal corrections. The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), which will reduce to the conventional Heisenberg relation in situations of weak gravity, is one of the candidates to be utilized to obtain the quantum corrections to the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. Recently the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) and generalized extended uncertainty principle (GEUP) are introduced to calculate entropy corrections with large length scales limit. In this paper, we obtain the quantum corrections to Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes based on the EUP and GEUP. Some attractive results are derived.
Using approximate symmetry methods for differential equations we have investigated the exact and approximate symmetries of a Lagrangian for the geodesic equations in the Kerr spacetime. Taking Minkowski spacetime as the exact case, it is shown that the symmetry algebra of the Lagrangian is 17 dimensional. This algebra is related to the 15 dimensional Lie algebra of conformal isometries of Minkowski spacetime. First introducing spin angular momentum per unit mass as a small parameter we consider first-order approximate symmetries of the Kerr metric as a first perturbation of the Schwarzschild metric. We then consider the second-order approximate symmetries of the Kerr metric as a second perturbation of the Minkowski metric. The approximate symmetries are recovered for these spacetimes and there are no non- trivial approximate symmetries. A rescaling of the arc length parameter for consistency of the trivial second-order approximate symmetries of the geodesic equations indicates that the energy in the charged-Kerr metric has to be rescaled and the rescaling factor is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>-dependent. This re-scaling factor is compared with that for the Reissner–Nordström metric.
We present, for both Minkowskian and Euclidean signatures, short derivations of the diagonal Einstein metrics for Bianchi type II, III and V. For the first two cases we show the integrability of the geodesic flow while for the third case a somewhat unusual bifurcation phenomenon takes place: for Minkowskian signature elliptic functions are essential in the metric while for Euclidean signature only elementary functions appear.
In this work, the Cosmic No-Hair Conjecture (CNHC) has been examined in the context of Randall–Sundrum type-II braneworld model. Instead of considering the usual anti-de Sitter bulk, a general form of the bulk matter has been taken into account. The effective Einstein equation on the brane has been derived. In order to obey the CNHC, some restrictions are obtained on the quadratic correction term as well as on the projected part of the bulk energy momentum tensor on the brane. It is found that for the validity of the conjecture on the brane, the bulk matter need not satisfy the standard energy conditions.

This reprinting of a paper by Kerr and Schild, first published in 1965 in a conference volume that is difficult to get hold of today, has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. It is the only publication showing how the Kerr solution was originally arrived at. In this reprint the editors have added several footnotes that update the references to the literature. The paper is accompanied by an editorial note written by A. Krasiński, E.Verdaguer and R. P. Kerr, and by the biography of Kerr written by A. Krasiński.
The covariance group for general relativity, the diffeomorphisms, is replaced by a group of coordinate transformations which contains the diffeomorphisms as a proper subgroup. The larger group is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree whether any given quantity is conserved. Alternatively, and equivalently, it is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree that the general relativistic wave equation describes the propagation of light. Thus, the group replacement is analogous to the replacement of the Lorentz group by the diffeomorphisms that led Einstein from special relativity to general relativity, and is also consistent with the assumption of constant light velocity that led him to special relativity. The enlarged covariance group leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a nonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive invariant entities. This yields a theory which unifies the gravitational and electroweak interactions. The theory contains no adjustable parameters, such as those that are chosen arbitrarily in the standard model.
Some authors found that, in different coordinates, the tunneling approach gives different Hawking temperature for the Schwarzschild black hole recently. In this paper, by studying the Hawking radiation of the Kerr black hole arising from the scalar and Dirac particles, we find that, to obtain the Hawking temperature by using tunneling effect, the coordinate representations for the stationary Kerr black hole should satisfy two conditions: (a) to keep the Killing vectors <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({{\xi_{(t)}^\mu}}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({{\xi_{(\varphi)}^\mu}}\)</span> invariant; and (b) the radial coordinate transformation is a regular and non-zero function.
We study the effects of an information-theoretically motivated nonlinear correction to the Wheeler-deWitt equation in the minisuperspace scheme for flat, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 0, Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universes. When the only matter is a cosmological constant, the nonlinearity can provide a barrier that screens the original Big Bang, leading to the quantum creation of a universe through tunneling just as in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 1 case. When the matter is instead a free massless scalar field, the nonlinearity can again prevent a contracting classical universe from reaching zero size by creating a bounce. Our studies here are self-consistent to leading order in perturbation theory for the nonlinear effects.
In this paper, we review some properties for the evolving wormhole solution of Einstein equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. We integrate the geodesic equations in the effective geometry obeyed by photons; we check out the weak field limit and find the traversability conditions. Then we analyze the case when the lagrangian depends on two electromagnetic invariants and it turns out that there is not a more general solution within the assumed geometry.
We construct a coordinate system for the Kerr solution, based on the zero angular momentum observers dropped from infinity, which generalizes the Painlevé–Gullstrand coordinate system for the Schwarzschild solution. The Kerr metric can then be interpreted as describing space flowing on a (curved) Riemannian 3-manifold. The stationary limit arises as the set of points on this manifold where the speed of the flow equals the speed of light, and the horizons as the set of points where the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">radial</em> speed equals the speed of light. A deeper analysis of what is meant by the flow of space reveals that the acceleration of free-falling objects is generally <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> in the direction of this flow. Finally, we compare the new coordinate system with the closely related Doran coordinate system.
This article investigates the full Boltzmann equation up to second order in the cosmological perturbations. Describing the distribution of polarized radiation by using a tensor valued distribution function, the second order Boltzmann equation, including polarization, is derived without relying on the Stokes parameters.
We consider the cosmological symmetry reduction of the Plebanski action as a toy-model to explore, in this simple framework, some issues related to loop quantum gravity and spin-foam models. We make the classical analysis of the model and perform both path integral and canonical quantizations. As for the full theory, the reduced model admits two disjoint types of classical solutions: topological and gravitational ones. The quantization mixes these two solutions, which prevents the model from being equivalent to standard quantum cosmology. Furthermore, the topological solution dominates at the classical limit. We also study the effect of an Immirzi parameter in the model.
A new unified metric form is presented for the Kerr–Newman geometry. The new form is a generalization of the Boyer–Lindquist metric involving an arbitrary gauge function of the spheroidal radial variable. Each choice of the gauge function corresponds to a coordinate system including four of the most important coordinate systems for Kerr–Newman (Boyer–Lindquist, Kerr, Kerr–Schild and Doran coordinates). The representation is given in terms of a single Minkowski frame together with the gauge function. This Minkowski frame arises by boosting a static orthonormal frame which is adapted to spheroidal coordinates. Properties of the boost reflect the rotating nature of the Kerr–Newman solution including an identification of the angular velocities of the disk and the horizon matching previously known values obtained in other ways.
General relativity predicts closed timelike curves between spinning bodies unless the parameters obey a certain relation. However, the region in which this could occur for terrestrial experiments is immeasurably small.
Some solutions of 5D conformally flat extension of induced-matter theory are derived. The corresponding induced matter solutions on the 4D hypersurfaces and their properties are presented.
Although infinite cylinders are not astrophysical entities, it is possible to learn a great deal about the basic qualitative features of generation of gravitational waves and the behavior of the matter conforming such shells in the limits of very small radius. We study an analytical model of a relativistic cylindrical shell of counter-rotating particles using kinetic theory for the matter and the junction conditions through the shell to obtain its equation of motion. The nature of the static solutions are analyzed, both for a single shell as well as for two coaxial shells. In the latter case, we integrate numerically the time dependent equation of motion of the external shell, when we neglect the wave components of the gravitational field at the shells locations. We obtain solutions that correspond to shells that perform damped oscillations, collapse, or are locally expanding. The collapse ends (numerically) when the external shell hits the interior shell. The numerically work also shows that the radiation becomes important after the bounce of the external shell.
It is well known that phase transitions arise if the interaction among particles embodies an attractive as well as a repulsive contribution. In this work it will be shown that the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry, characterized through a deformation in the relation dispersion, plus the bosonic statistics predict the emergence of critical points. In other words, in some quantum gravity models the structure of spacetime implies the emergence of critical points even when no interaction among the particles has been considered.
It is shown that the interior solution of axially symmetric, stationary and rigidly rotating dust configurations is completely determined by the mass density along the axis of rotation. The particularly interesting case of a mass density, which is cylindrical symmetric in the interior of the dust configuration, is presented. Among other things, this proves the non-existence of homogeneous dust configurations.
After considering the reference case of the motion of spinning test bodies in the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild space–time, we generalize the results to the case of the motion of a spinning particle in the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild–de Sitter space–time. Specifically, we obtain the loci of turning points of the particle in this plane. We show that the cosmological constant affect the particle motion when the particle distance from the black hole is of the order of the inverse square root of the cosmological constant.
In this paper we investigate expanding Bianchi type I models with two tilted fluids with the same linear equation of state, characterized by the equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>. Individually the fluids have non-zero energy fluxes w.r.t. the symmetry surfaces, but these cancel each other because of the Codazzi constraint. We prove that when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> = 0 the model isotropizes to the future. Using numerical simulations and a linear analysis we also find the asymptotic states of models with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &gt; 0. We find that future isotropization occurs if and only if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({w\leq \frac{1}{3}}\)</span> . The results are compared to similar models investigated previously where the two fluids have different equation of state parameters.



This is a reprinting of Part 1 of Brandon Carter’s lectures given at the 1972 Les Houches school on black holes, first published in a book of proceedings of that school in 1973. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. The main value of this article is a comprehensive discussion of global properties of the Kerr solution, its maximal extension, its derivation from the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation and, most notably, its generalisation to nonzero cosmological constant. Numerous typos of the original text are corrected in this reprinting. The reprinted article is accompanied by an editorial note written by Niky Kamran and Andrzej Krasiński, and by B. Carter’s brief autobiography.

The Einstein evolution of a dust shell universe with spatial spherical symmetry is analyzed. The implicit and parametric solutions of Tolman–Bondi equations are proposed in order to show its agreement with the rectilinear solutions of Kepler’s problem. Finally, a complete systematization of Tolman–Bondi models is obtained through the classical Weierstrass approach.
In this paper we study the accretion of dark energy onto a black hole in the cases that dark energy is equipped with a positive cosmological constant and when the space-time is described by a Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric. While the first case is the same as the usual accretion procedure for a more complicated fluid, the second one give rise to a consistent cosmic scenario for the mentioned phenomenon.
An exact solution of Einstein’s equations representing the static gravitational field of a quasi-spherical source endowed with both mass and mass quadrupole moment is considered. It belongs to the Weyl class of solutions and reduces to the Schwarzschild solution when the quadrupole moment vanishes. The geometric properties of timelike circular orbits (including geodesics) in this spacetime are investigated. Moreover, a comparison between geodesic motion in the spacetime of a quasi-spherical source and non-geodesic motion of an extended body also endowed with both mass and mass quadrupole moment as described by Dixon’s model in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed. Certain “reciprocity relations” between the source and the particle parameters are obtained, providing a further argument in favor of the acceptability of Dixon’s model for extended bodies in general relativity.
The existence of the Carter constant in the Vaidya–Einstein–Kerr (VEK) spacetime and its relation to the Petrov type is investigated. This spacetime is an example of a black hole in an asymptotically non-flat background. We construct the Carter constant and obtain the Killing tensor in the VEK spacetime. The Newman–Penrose formalism is employed to obtain the spin coefficients. We present a complete (Petrov) classification of the VEK spacetime and the special case of the non-rotating Vaidya–Einstein–Schwarzschild spacetime. We demonstrate explicitly that both spacetimes are of type-D.
The conditions for the existence and stability of cosmological power-law scaling solutions are established when the Einstein–Hilbert action is modified by the inclusion of a function of the Gauss–Bonnet curvature invariant. The general form of the action that leads to such solutions is determined for the case where the universe is sourced by a barotropic perfect fluid. It is shown by employing an equivalence between the Gauss–Bonnet action and a scalar–tensor theory of gravity that the cosmological field equations can be written as a plane autonomous system. It is found that stable scaling solutions exist when the parameters of the model take appropriate values.
We investigate the relations between the inertial forces and the Einstein equations in axially symmetric stationary spacetimes. For the vacuum stationary axially symmetric spacetimes, we use the Geroch formalism to express the Einstein equations in terms of inertial forces. For the spacetimes with the perfect fluid sources, we use the formalism developed by Hansen and Winicour for establishing the relations. As expected intuitively, the gradients of inertial forces represent the field equations.
Recently, fermions tunneling beyond semiclassical approximation from an uncharged static black hole was investigated by Majhi, which was based on the work of Banerjee and Majhi, it was found that the black hole entropy correction can be produced as the quantum effect of a particle is taken into account. In this paper, we further extend this idea to the stationary Kerr black hole to discuss its entropy correction. To get the corrections correctly, the proportionality parameters of quantum corrections of action <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub> to the semiclassical action <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> <sub>0</sub> in this case are regarded as the inverse of the product of Planck Length and Planck Mass. The result shows that entropy corrections to the stationary black hole also include the logarithmic term and inverse area term in Bekenstein–Hawking entropy beyond semiclassical approximation.
We discuss the current bounds on the Equivalence Principle (EP), in particular from structure formation and, reexamine in this context, the recent claim on the evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the Abell Cluster A586 and the ensued violation of the EP.
In the present work a procedure is build up, that allows obtaining dark matter (DM) and cosmic acceleration in our 4D universe embedded in a 5D manifold. Both, DM and the factor causing cosmic acceleration, as well ordinary matter are induced in the 4D space-time by a warped, but empty from matter, 5D bulk. The procedure is carried out in the framework of the Weyl–Dirac version (Israelit, Found Phys 35:1725, 2005; Israelit, Found Phys 35:1769, 2005) of Paul Wesson’s Induced Matter Theory (Wesson, Space-time matter, 1999) enriched by Rosen’s approach (Found Phys 12:213, 1982). Considering chaotically oriented Weyl vector fields, which exist in microscopic cells, we obtain cold dark matter (CDM) consisting of weylons, massive bosons having spin 1. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy at large scale we derive cosmological equations in which luminous matter, CDM and dark energy may be considered separately. Making in the given procedure use of present observational data one can develop a model of the Universe with conventional matter, DM and cosmic acceleration, induced by the 5D bulk.

We elaborate the signature of the extra dimensions and brane tension in the process of phantom and massive scalar emission in the spacetime of (4 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>)-dimensional tense brane black hole. Absorption cross section, luminosity of Hawking radiation and cross section in the low-energy approximation were found. We envisage that parameter connected with the existence of a brane imprints its role in the Hawking radiation of the considered fields.
Analytical and numerical calculations show that a putative temporal variation of the speed of light <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>, with the meaning of space-time structure constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sub>ST</sub>, assumed to be linear over timescales of about one century, would induce a secular precession of the longitude of the pericenter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\varpi}\)</span> of a test particle orbiting a spherically symmetric body. By comparing such a predicted effect to the corrections <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\Delta\dot\varpi}\)</span> to the usual Newtonian/Einsteinian perihelion precessions of the inner planets of the Solar System, recently estimated by E.V. Pitjeva by fitting about one century of modern astronomical observations with the standard classical/relativistic dynamical force models of the EPM epehemerides, we obtained <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\dot c/c =(0.5\pm 2)\times 10^{-7} {\rm yr}^{-1}}\)</span> . Moreover, the possibility that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\dot c/c\neq 0}\)</span> over the last century is ruled out at 3−12<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em> level by taking the ratios of the perihelia for different pairs of planets. Our results are independent of any measurement of the variations of other fundamental constants which may be explained by a variation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> itself (with the meaning of electromagnetic constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sub>EM</sub>). It will be important to repeat such tests if and when other teams of astronomers will estimate their own corrections to the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian planetary perihelion precessions with different ephemerides.
Inflation with a scalar-field potential of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">φ</em> <sup>2</sup> − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> can be described in terms of a parametrical attractor with critical points, whose driftage depends on the control value of the slowly changing Hubble rate. The method allows us to easily obtain theoretical expressions for fluctuations of inhomogeneity in both the cosmic microwave background and distribution of matter. We find the region for admissible values of potential parameters, wherein theoretical predictions are consistent with experimental results within the limits of measurement uncertainties.
Metrics obtained by integrating within the generalised invariant formalism are structured around their intrinsic coordinates, and this considerably simplifies their invariant classification and symmetry analysis. We illustrate this by presenting a simple and transparent complete invariant classification of the conformally flat pure radiation metrics (except plane waves) in such intrinsic coordinates; in particular we confirm that the three apparently non-redundant functions of one variable are genuinely non-redundant, and easily identify the subclasses which admit a Killing and/or a homothetic Killing vector. Most of our results agree with the earlier classification carried out by Skea in the different Koutras–McIntosh coordinates, which required much more involved calculations; but there are some subtle differences. Therefore, we also rework the classification in the Koutras–McIntosh coordinates, and by paying attention to some of the subtleties involving arbitrary functions, we obtain complete agreement with the results obtained in intrinsic coordinates. We have corrected and completed statements and results by Edgar and Vickers, and by Skea, about the orders of Cartan invariants at which particular information becomes available.
We study the cosmic time evolution of an effective quantum field theory energy-momentum tensor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> and show that, as a consequence of the effective nature of the theory, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> is such that the vacuum energy decreases with time. We find that the zero point energy at present time is washed out by the cosmological evolution. The implications of this finding for the cosmological constant problem are investigated.
Locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I cosmological models are examined in the presence of dynamically anisotropic dark energy and perfect fluid. We assume that the dark energy (DE) is minimally interacting, has dynamical energy density, anisotropic equation of state parameter (EoS). The conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of the DE is assumed to consist of two separately additive conserved parts. A special law is assumed for the deviation from isotropic EoS, which is consistent with the assumption on the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of the DE. Exact solutions of Einstein’s field equations are obtained by assuming a special law of variation for the mean Hubble parameter, which yields a constant value of the deceleration parameter. Geometrical and kinematic properties of the models and the behaviour of the anisotropy of the dark energy have been carried out. The models give dynamically anisotropic expansion history for the universe that allows to fine tune the isotropization of the Bianchi metric, hence the CMB anisotropy.
String theory suggests that black hole microstates are quantum, horizon sized ‘fuzzballs’, rather than smooth geometries with horizon. Radiation from fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">horizon</em>, and it seems that subsequent radiation <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">will</em> lead to information loss. We argue that the resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.
We investigate Einstein theories of gravity, coupled to a scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\varphi}\)</span> and point-like matter, which are characterized by a scalar field-dependent matter coupling function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({e^{H(\varphi)}}\)</span> . We show that under mild constraints on the form of the potential for the scalar field, there are a broad class of Einstein-like gravity models—characterized by the asymptotic behavior of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>—which allow for a non-Newtonian weak-field limit with the gravitational potential behaving for large distances as ln <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>. The Newtonian term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GM</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> appears only as sub-leading. We point out that this behavior is also shared by gravity models described by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) Lagrangians. The relevance of our results for the building of infrared modified theories of gravity and for modified Newtonian dynamics is also discussed.
We generalize the Cosmological Slingshot Scenario for a Slingshot brane moving in a Klebanov–Strassler throat. We show that the horizon and isotropy problems of standard cosmology are avoided, while the flatness problem is acceptably alleviated. Regarding the primordial perturbations, we identify their vacuum state and elucidate the evolution from the quantum to the classical regimes. Also, we calculate their exact power spectrum showing its compatibility with current data. We discuss the bouncing solution from a four dimensional point of view. In this framework the radial and angular motion of the Slingshot brane are described by two scalar fields. We show that the bouncing solution for the scale factor in String frame is mapped into a monotonically increasing (in conformal time) solution in the Einstein frame. We finally discuss about the regularity of the geometry in Einstein frame.
The horizon (the surface) of a black hole is a null surface, defined by those hypothetical “outgoing” light rays that just hover under the influence of the strong gravity at the surface. Because the light rays are orthogonal to the spatial two-dimensional surface at one instant of time, the surface area of the black hole is the same for all observers (i.e. the same for all coordinate definitions of “instant of time”). This value is 4π(2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gm</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> for nonspinning black holes, with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> = Newton’s constant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> = speed of light, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> = mass of the black hole. The three-dimensional spatial volume inside a black hole, in contrast, depends explicitly on the definition of time, and can even be time dependent, or zero. We give examples of the volume found inside a standard, nonspinning spherical black hole, for several different standard time-coordinate definitions. Elucidating these results for the volume provides a new pedagogical resource of facts already known in principle to the relativity community, but rarely worked out.
The Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic potential, supplemented by the Lorenz gauge condition, are decoupled and solved exactly in de Sitter space–time studied in static spherical coordinates. There is no source besides the background. One component of the vector field is expressed, in its radial part, through the solution of a fourth-order ordinary differential equation obeying given initial conditions. The other components of the vector field are then found by acting with lower-order differential operators on the solution of the fourth-order equation (while the transverse part is decoupled and solved exactly from the beginning). The whole four-vector potential is eventually expressed through hypergeometric functions and spherical harmonics. Its radial part is plotted for given choices of initial conditions. We have thus completely succeeded in solving the homogeneous vector wave equation for Maxwell theory in the Lorenz gauge when a de Sitter space–time is considered, which is relevant both for inflationary cosmology and gravitational wave theory. The decoupling technique and analytic formulae and plots are completely original. This is an important step towards solving exactly the tensor wave equation in de Sitter space–time, which has important applications to the theory of gravitational waves about curved backgrounds.
Under a particular choice of the Ernst potential, we solve analytically the Einstein–Maxwell equations to derive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a new exact solution</em> depending on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">five parameters</em>: the mass, the angular-momentum (per unit mass), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>, the electromagnetic-field strength, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>, the parameter-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and the Kerr-NUT parameter, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>. This (Petrov Type D) solution is cylindrically symmetric and represents the curved background around a charged, rotating cosmic string, surrounded by gravitational and electromagnetic waves, under the influence of the Kerr-NUT parameter. A C-energy study in the radiation zone suggests that both the incoming and the outgoing radiation is gravitational, strongly focused around the null direction and preserving its profile. In this case, the absence of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>-parameter from the C-energy implies that, away from the linear defect the electromagnetic field is too weak to contribute to the energy-content of the cylindrically symmetric space-time under consideration. In order to explain this result, we have evaluated the Weyl and the Maxwell scalars near the axis of the linear defect and at the spatial infinity. Accordingly, we have found that the electromagnetic field is concentrated (mainly) in the vicinity of the axis, while falling-off prominently at large radial distances. However, as long as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> ≠ 1, the non-zero Kerr-NUT parameter enhances those scalars, both near the axis and at the spatial infinity, introducing some sort of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gravitomagnetic</em> contribution.
A pedagogical introduction to some of the main ideas and results of field theories on quantized spacetimes is presented, with emphasis on what such field theories may teach us about the problem of quantizing gravity. We examine to what extent noncommutative gauge theories may be regarded as gauge theories of gravity. UV/IR mixing is explained in detail and we describe its relations to renormalization, to gravitational dynamics, and to deformed dispersion relations in models of quantum spacetime of interest in string theory and in doubly special relativity. We also discuss some potential experimental probes of spacetime noncommutativity.
We describe non-flat standard Friedmann cosmology of canonical scalar field with barotropic fluid in form of non-linear Schrödinger-type (NLS) formulation in which all cosmological dynamical quantities are expressed in term of Schrödinger quantities as similar to those in time-independent quantum mechanics. We assume the expansion to be superfast, i.e. phantom expansion. We report all Schrödinger-analogous quantities to scalar field cosmology. Effective equation of state coefficient is analyzed and illustrated. We show that in a non-flat universe, there is no fixed <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> value for the phantom divide. In a non-flat universe, even <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> &gt; −1, the expansion can be phantom. Moreover, in open universe, phantom expansion can happen even with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> &gt; 0. We also report scalar field exact solutions within frameworks of the Friedmann formulation and the NLS formulation in non-flat universe cases.
Previous work in the literature had built a formalism for spatially averaged equations for the scale factor, giving rise to an averaged Raychaudhuri equation and averaged Hamiltonian constraint, which involve a backreaction source term. The present paper extends these equations to include models with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term, motivated by the nonperturbative renormalization program for quantum gravity based upon the Einstein–Hilbert action. We focus on the Brans–Dicke form of the renormalization-group improved action functional. The coupling between backreaction and spatially averaged three-dimensional scalar curvature is found to survive, and a variable-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> cosmic quintet is found to emerge. Interestingly, under suitable assumptions, an approximate solution can be found where the early universe tends to a Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker model, while keeping track of the original inhomogeneities through three effective fluids. The resulting qualitative picture is that of a universe consisting of baryons only, while inhomogeneities average out to give rise to the full dark-side phenomenology.
We find large classes of non-asymptotically flat Einstein–Yang–Mills–Dilaton and Einstein–Yang–Mills–Born–Infeld–Dilaton black holes in N-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime expressed in terms of the quasilocal mass. Extension of the dilatonic YM solution to N-dimensions has been possible by employing the generalized Wu-Yang ansatz. Another metric ansatz, which aided in finding exact solutions is the functional dependence of the radius function on the dilaton field. These classes of black holes are stable against linear radial perturbations. In the limit of vanishing dilaton we obtain Bertotti–Robinson type metrics with the topology of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> <sub>2</sub>×<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>–2</sup>. Since connection can be established between dilaton and a scalar field of Brans–Dicke type we obtain black hole solutions also in the Brans–Dicke–Yang–Mills theory as well.
In this paper, we solve Einsteins’ field equations for a circularly symmetric anisotropic fluid, with kinematic self-similarity of the first kind, in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes. Considering the case where the radial pressure vanishes, we show that there exists a solution that represents the gravitational collapse of an anisotropic fluid, and the collapse will finally form a black hole, even if the fluid is constituted by phantom energy.
The gravitational time advancement (negative time delay) is a natural but a consequence of curve space-time geometry. In the present work the possibility of experimental detection of time advancement effect has been explored.
We develop an extension of Bohmian mechanics by defining Bohm-like trajectories for quantum particles in a curved background space–time containing a spacelike singularity. As an example of such a metric we use the Schwarzschild metric, which contains two spacelike singularities, one in the past and one in the future. Since the particle world lines are everywhere timelike or lightlike, particles can be annihilated but not created at a future spacelike singularity, and created but not annihilated at a past spacelike singularity. It is argued that in the presence of future (past) spacelike singularities, there is a unique natural Bohm-like evolution law directed to the future (past). This law differs from the one in non-singular space–times mainly in two ways: it involves Fock space since the particle number is not conserved, and the wave function is replaced by a density matrix. In particular, we determine the evolution equation for the density matrix, a pure-to-mixed evolution equation of a quasi-Lindblad form. We have to leave open whether a curvature cut-off needs to be introduced for this equation to be well defined.
Hawking temperature of a static and spherically symmetric black hole beyond semiclassical approximation is studied. The calculations show us that different definition of the particle’s energy gives different Hawking temperature. However, we argue that the result obtained using the standard definition of the particle energy is reasonable because it keeps the validity of the first law of the thermodynamics, i.e., both the Hawking temperature and entropy are not modified by the quantum tunneling beyond semiclassical approximation. The result shows us that any hypothetical <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\hbar}\)</span> corrections to the tunneling rate are to be interpreted not as quantum corrections to the Hawking temperature but as fluctuations about a thermal background.
In the work of Kerner et al. (Phys Rev D 63:027502, 2001) the problem of the geodesic deviation in a 5D Kaluza–Klein background is faced. The 4D space–time projection of the resulting equation coincides with the usual geodesic deviation equation in the presence of the Lorenz force, provided that the fifth component of the deviation vector satisfies an extra constraint which takes into account the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> conservation along the path. The analysis was performed setting as a constant the scalar field which appears in Kaluza–Klein model. Here we focus on the extension of such a work to the model where the presence of the scalar field is considered. Our result coincides with that of Kerner et al. when the minimal case <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\phi=1}\)</span> is considered, while it shows some departures in the general case. The novelty due to the presence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\phi}\)</span> is that the variation of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> between the two geodesic lines is not conserved during the motion; an exact law for such a behaviour has been derived.
In this paper, we present the metric for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional charged slowly rotating dilaton black hole with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = [(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> −1)/2] independent rotation parameters, associated with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> orthogonal planes of rotation in the background of asymptotically flat and asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter spacetime. The mass, angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole are determined for the arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling constant. We find that the gyromagnetic ratio crucially depends on the dilaton coupling constant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>, and decreases with increasing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> in any dimension.
In this work the matching of a LTB interior solution representing dust matter to the Vaidya exterior solution describing null fluid through a null hypersurface is studied. Different cases in which one is able to smoothly match these two solutions to Einstein equations along a null hypesurface are discussed.
It is a well known analytic result in general relativity that the 2-dimensional area of the apparent horizon of a black hole remains invariant regardless of the motion of the observer, and in fact is independent of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">constant</em> slice, which can be quite arbitrary in general relativity. Nonetheless the explicit computation of horizon area is often substantially more difficult in some frames (complicated by the coordinate form of the metric), than in other frames. Here we give an explicit demonstration for very restricted metric forms of (Schwarzschild and Kerr) vacuum black holes. In the Kerr–Schild coordinate expression for these spacetimes they have an explicit Lorentz-invariant form. We consider <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">boosted</em> versions with the black hole moving through the coordinate system. Since these are stationary black hole spacetimes, the apparent horizons are two dimensional cross sections of their event horizons, so we compute the areas of apparent horizons in the boosted space with (boosted) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">constant</em>, and obtain the same result as in the unboosted case. Note that while the invariance of area is generic, we deal only with black holes in the Kerr–Schild form, and consider only one particularly simple change of slicing which amounts to a boost. Even with these restrictions we find that the results illuminate the physics of the horizon as a null surface and provide a useful pedagogical tool. As far as we can determine, this is the first explicit calculation of this type demonstrating the area invariance of horizons. Further, these calculations are directly relevant to transformations that arise in computational representation of moving black holes. We present an application of this result to initial data for boosted black holes.
Using the differential equation obtained from spacelike level hypersurfaces in a Lorentzian manifold, the volume expansion rate of an achronal spacelike hypersurface orthogonal to a timelike geodesic is investigated in terms of the integral Ricci and scalar curvature bound.
We study the (local) propagation of plane waves in a relativistic, non- dissipative, two-fluid system, allowing for a relative velocity in the “background” configuration. The main aim is to analyze relativistic two-stream instability. This instability requires a relative flow—either across an interface or when two or more fluids interpenetrate—and can be triggered, for example, when one-dimensional plane-waves appear to be left-moving with respect to one fluid, but right-moving with respect to another. The dispersion relation of the two-fluid system is studied for different two-fluid equations of state: (i) the “free” (where there is no direct coupling between the fluid densities), (ii) coupled, and (iii) entrained (where the fluid momenta are linear combinations of the velocities) cases are considered in a frame-independent fashion (e.g.no restriction to the rest-frame of either fluid). As a by-product of our analysis we determine the necessary conditions for a two-fluid system to be causal and absolutely stable and establish a new constraint on the entrainment.
We investigate the influence of a cosmological constant on the energy levels of a one-electron atom in Fermi normal coordinates. The non-relativistic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nS</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nP</em> energy levels and the relativistic 1<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub>1/2</sub>, 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub>1/2</sub>, 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> <sub>1/2</sub>, 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> <sub>3/2</sub> energy levels are calculated in terms of the Riemann tensor. These energy level shifts are non-zero which indicate that the first order gravitational perturbations can partly remove the degeneracy of the studied states in de Sitter space. We show that it is not possible to use the hydrogen atom as a probe of background curvature of the universe. In the second order of perturbation, for 1<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> state, an upper limit for the energy shifts is obtained.
Following Einstein’s definition of Lagrangian density and gravitational field energy density (Einstein in Ann Phys Lpz 49:806, 1916, Einstein in Phys Z 19:115, 1918, Pauli in Theory of Relativity, B.I. Publications, Mumbai, 1963), Tolman derived a general formula for the total matter plus gravitational field energy (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> <sub>0</sub>) of an arbitrary system (Tolman in Phys Rev 35:875, 1930, Tolman in Relativity, Thermodynamics &amp; Cosmology, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1962, Xulu in hep-th/0308070, 2003). For a static isolated system, in quasi-Cartesian coordinates, this formula leads to the well known result <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({P_0 = \int \sqrt{-g} (T_0^0 - T_1^1 - T_2^2 - T_3^3) d^3 x,}\)</span> where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> is the determinant of the metric tensor and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({T^a_b}\)</span> is the energy momentum tensor of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">matter</em>. Though in the literature, this is known as “Tolman Mass”, it must be realized that this is essentially “Einstein Mass” because the underlying pseudo-tensor here is due to Einstein. In fact, Landau–Lifshitz obtained the same expression for the “inertial mass” of a static isolated system without using any pseudo-tensor at all and which points to physical significance and correctness of Einstein Mass (Landau, Lifshitz in The Classical Theory of Fields, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1962)! For the first time we apply this general formula to find an expression for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> <sub>0</sub> for the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric by using the same quasi-Cartesian basis. As we analyze this new result, it transpires that, physically, a spatially flat model having no cosmological constant is preferred. Eventually, it is seen that conservation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> <sub>0</sub> is honoured only in the static limit.
Massive gravity which has been constructed from a cohomological formulation of gauge invariance by means of the descent equations is here investigated in the classical limit. Gauge invariance requires a vector-graviton field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> coupled to the massive tensor field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>. In the limit of vanishing graviton mass the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>-field does not decouple. On the classical level this leads to a modification of general relativity. The contribution of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>-field to the energy-momentum tensor can be interpreted as dark matter density and pressure. We solve the modified field equations in the simplest spherically symmetric geometry.
The canonical quantization for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 1 supergravity in the context of gravitational minisuperspace described by Gowdy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sup>3</sup> and Bianchi class A cosmological models is analyzed in order to search for physical states. There are indeed physical states in the minisuperspace sector of the theory. This fact entails that the non-physical states conjecture has a restricted validity, and in consequence it cannot be considered a general result.
For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{N}\ge 2}\)</span> supergravities, BPS black hole solutions preserving four supersymmetries can be superposed linearly, leading to well defined solutions containing an arbitrary number of such BPS black holes at arbitrary positions. Being stationary, these solutions can be understood via associated non-linear sigma models over pseudo-Riemannian spaces coupled to Euclidean gravity in three spatial dimensions. As the main result of this paper, we show that whenever this pseudo-Riemannian space is an irreducible symmetric space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathfrak{G}/\mathfrak{H}^*}\)</span>, the most general solutions of this type can be entirely characterised and derived from the nilpotent orbits of the associated Lie algebra <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathfrak{g}}\)</span>. This technique also permits the explicit computation of non-supersymmetric extremal solutions which cannot be obtained by truncation to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\mathcal{N}=2}\)</span> supergravity theories. For maximal supergravity, we not only recover the known BPS solutions depending on 32 independent harmonic functions, but in addition find a set of non-BPS solutions depending on 29 harmonic functions. While the BPS solutions can be understood within the appropriate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\mathcal{N}=2}\)</span> truncation of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\({\mathcal{N}=8}\)</span> supergravity, the general non-BPS solutions require the whole field content of the theory.
We consider the stationary solutions of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathcal{N} = 4}\)</span> supergravity coupled to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> vector multiplets that define linear superpositions of non-interacting extremal black holes. The most general solutions of this type are derived from the graded decompositions of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\mathfrak{so}(8, 2 + n)}\)</span> associated to its nilpotent orbits. We illustrate the formalism by giving explicitly asymptotically Minkowski non-BPS solutions of the most exotic class depending on 6 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> harmonic functions.
Motivated by the observed cosmic matter distribution, we present the following conjecture: due to the formation of voids and opaque structures, the average matter density on the path of the light from the well-observed objects changes from Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> ≃ 1 in the homogeneous early universe to Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub> ≃ 0 in the clumpy late universe, so that the average expansion rate increases along our line of sight from EdS expansion <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ht</em> ≃ 2/3 at high redshifts to free expansion <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ht</em> ≃ 1 at low redshifts. To calculate the modified observable distance–redshift relations, we introduce a generalized Dyer–Roeder method that allows for two crucial physical properties of the universe: inhomogeneities in the expansion rate and the growth of the nonlinear structures. By treating the transition redshift to the void-dominated era as a free parameter, we find a phenomenological fit to the observations from the CMB anisotropy, the position of the baryon oscillation peak, the magnitude–redshift relations of type Ia supernovae, the local Hubble flow and the nucleosynthesis, resulting in a concordant model of the universe with 90% dark matter, 10% baryons, no dark energy, 15 Gyr as the age of the universe and a natural value for the transition redshift <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> <sub>0</sub> = 0.35. Unlike a large local void, the model respects the cosmological principle, further offering an explanation for the late onset of the perceived acceleration as a consequence of the forming nonlinear structures. Additional tests, such as quantitative predictions for angular deviations due to an anisotropic void distribution and a theoretical derivation of the model, can vindicate or falsify the interpretation that light propagation in voids is responsible for the perceived acceleration.
The problem of finding a covariant expression for the distribution and conservation of gravitational energy–momentum dates to the 1910s. A suitably covariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann’s realization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational energy–momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric (or rather, all of them) or connection, because the desired gauge invariance properties are obvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity without any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of pseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">every</em> coordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily adapted to any pseudotensorial expression (Landau–Lifshitz, Goldberg, Papapetrou or the like) or to any tensorial expression built with a background metric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can be chosen on technical grounds such as relating to Noether’s theorem and yielding expected values of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then rendered covariant using the procedure described here. The application to angular momentum localization is straightforward. Traditional objections to pseudotensors are based largely on the false assumption that there is only one gravitational energy rather than infinitely many.
Since the Newtonian gravitation is largely used to model with success the structures of the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, for example, a way to probe and constrain alternative theories, in the weak field limit, is to apply them to model the structures of the universe. We then modified the well known <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gadget-2</em> code to probe alternative theories of gravitation through galactic dynamics. In particular, we modified the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gadget-2</em> code to probe alternatives theories whose weak field limits have a Yukawa-like gravitational potential. As a first application of this modified <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gadget-2</em> code we simulate the evolution of elliptical galaxies. These simulations show that galactic dynamics can be used to constrain the parameters associated with alternative theories of gravitation.
Hawking radiation from a Kerr–Newman black hole is investigated using Hamilton–Jacobi method more deeply. A direct computation will lead to a wrong result via Hamilton–Jacobi method. However, when the well-behaved Painleve coordinate system and Eddington coordinate system are considered, we can get the correct result. The reason of the discrepancy between naive coordinate and well-behaved coordinates is also discussed.
I correct some recent misunderstandings about, and amplify some details of, an old explicit non-geometrical derivation of GR.

We present a Chaplygin gas Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological model in the presence of the cosmological constant. We apply the Schutz’s variational formalism to recover the notion of time, and this gives rise to Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale factor. We study the early and late time universes and show that the presence of the Chaplygin gas leads to an effective positive cosmological constant for the late times. This suggests the possibility of changing the sign of the effective cosmological constant during the transition from the early times to the late times. For the case of an effective negative cosmological constant for both epoches, we solve the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the Spectral Method and find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for positive, zero, and negative constant spatial curvatures. Then, we use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case and obtain the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factors, which are found to oscillate between finite maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation value of the scale factors never tend to the singular point, we have an initial indication that this model may not have singularities at the quantum level.
The general form of the anisotropy parameter of the expansion for Bianchi type-III metric is obtained in the presence of a single diagonal imperfect fluid with a dynamically anisotropic equation of state parameter and a dynamical energy density in general relativity. A special law is assumed for the anisotropy of the fluid which reduces the anisotropy parameter of the expansion to a simple form (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Delta\propto H^{-2}V^{-2}}\)</span>, where Δ is the anisotropy parameter, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> is the mean Hubble parameter and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> is the volume of the universe). The exact solutions of the Einstein field equations, under the assumption on the anisotropy of the fluid, are obtained for exponential and power-law volumetric expansions. The isotropy of the fluid, space and expansion are examined. It is observed that the universe can approach to isotropy monotonically even in the presence of an anisotropic fluid. The anisotropy of the fluid also isotropizes at later times for accelerating models and evolves into the well-known cosmological constant in the model for exponential volumetric expansion.
In the weak field limit general relativity reduces, as is well known, to the Newtonian gravitation. Alternative theories of gravity, however, do not necessarily reduce to Newtonian gravitation; some of them, for example, reduce to Yukawa-like potentials instead of the Newtonian potential. Since the Newtonian gravitation is largely used to model with success the structures of the universe, such as for example galaxies and clusters of galaxies, a way to probe and constrain alternative theories, in the weak field limit, is to apply them to model the structures of the universe. In the present study, we consider how to probe Yukawa-like potentials using <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>-body numerical simulations.
We obtain cosmological solutions which admit emergent universe (EU) scenario in the framework of Einstein Gauss–Bonnet (GB) gravity coupled with a dilaton field in 4-dimensions. The coupling parameter of the GB terms and the dilaton in the theory are determined for obtaining an EU scenario. The corresponding dilaton potential which admits such scenario is determined. It is found that the GB terms coupled with a dilaton field plays an important role in describing the dynamics of the evolution of the early as well as the late universe. We note an interesting case where the GB term dominates initially in the asymptotic past regime, subsequently it decreases and thereafter its contribution in determining the dynamics of the evolution dominates once again. We note that the Einstein’s static universe solution permitted here is unstable which the asymptotic EU might follow. We also compare our EU model with supernova data.
In this paper, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon in the holographic dark energy (DE) model. The universe is chosen to be homogeneous and isotropic and the validity of the first law has been assumed here. The matter in the universe is taken in the form of non-interacting two fluid system: one component is the holographic DE model and the other component is in the form of dust.
We consider a non-minimally coupled (with gravity) scalar field with non-canonical kinetic energy. The form of the kinetic term is of Dirac–Born–Infeld form. We study the early evolution of the universe when it is sourced only by the k-field, as well as late time evolution when both the matter and k-field are present. For the k-field, we have considered constant potential as well as potential inspired from boundary string field theory. We show that it is possible to have an inflationary solution in early time as well as late time accelerating phases. The solutions also exhibit attractor properties in a sense that they do not depend on the initial conditions for certain values of the parameters.
The Chaplygin gas model, characterized by an equation of state of the type <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({p = - \frac{A}{\rho}}\)</span> emerges naturally from the Nambu-Goto action of string theory. This fluid representation can be recast under the form of a tachyonic field given by a Born–Infeld type Lagrangian. At the same time, the Chaplygin gas equation of state can be obtained from a self-interacting scalar field. We show that, from the point of view of the supernova type Ia data, the three representations (fluid, tachyonic, scalar field) lead to the same results. However, concerning the matter power spectra, while the fluid and tachyonic descriptions lead to exactly the same results, the self-interacting scalar field representation implies different statistical estimations for the parameters. In particular, the estimation for the dark matter density parameter in the fluid representation favors a universe dominated almost completely by dark matter, while in the self-interacting scalar field representation the prediction is very close to that obtained in the ΛCDM model.
Harrison’s argument against the interpretation of the cosmological redshift as a Doppler effect is revisited, exaggerated, and discussed. The context, purpose, and limitations of the interpretations of this phenomenon are clarified.
The quantum theory of the vector field minimally coupled to the gravity of the de Sitter spacetime is built in a canonical manner starting with a new complete set of quantum modes of given momentum and helicity derived in the moving chart of conformal time. It is shown that the canonical quantization leads to new vector propagators which satisfy similar equations as the propagators derived by Tsamis and Woodard (J Math Phys 48:052306, 2007) but having a different structure. The one-particle operators are also written down pointing out that their properties are similar with those found already in the quantum theory of the scalar, Dirac and Maxwell free fields.
The most common spin foam models of gravity are widely believed to be discrete path integral quantizations of the Plebanski action. However, their derivation in present formulations is incomplete and lower dimensional simplex amplitudes are left open to choice. Since their large-spin behavior determines the convergence properties of the state-sum, this gap has to be closed before any reliable conclusion about finiteness can be reached. It is shown that these amplitudes are directly related to the path integral measure and can in principle be derived from it, requiring detailed knowledge of the constraint algebra and gauge fixing. In a related manner, minimal requirements of background independence provide non trivial restrictions on the form of an anomaly free measure. Many models in the literature do not satisfy these requirements. A simple model satisfying the above consistency requirements is presented which can be thought of as a spin foam quantization of the Husain–Kuchař model.
The modified gravitational equations to describe a four-dimensional braneworld in the case with the Lorentz invariant violation in a bulk spacetime is presented. It contains a trace part of the brane energy-momentum tensor and the coefficients of all terms describe the Lorentz violation effects from the bulk spacetime. As an application, we apply this formalism to study cosmology. In respect to standard effective Friedmann equations on the brane, Lorentz invariance violation in the bulk causes a modification of this equations that can lead to significant physical consequences. In particular, the effective Friedmann equation on the brane explicitly depends on the equation of state of the brane matter and the Lorentz violating parameters. We show that the components of five-dimensional Weyl curvature are related to the matter on brane even at low energies. We also find that the constraints on the theory parameters are depend on the equation of state of the energy components of the brane matter. Finally, the stability of the model depend on the specific choices of initial conditions and the parameters <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">i</em> </sub>.
We present an alternative cosmology based on conformal gravity, as originally introduced by H. Weyl and recently revisited by P. Mannheim and D. Kazanas. Unlike past similar attempts our approach is a purely kinematical application of the conformal symmetry to the Universe, through a critical reanalysis of fundamental astrophysical observations, such as the cosmological redshift and others. As a result of this novel approach we obtain a closed-form expression for the cosmic scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) and a revised interpretation of the space–time coordinates usually employed in cosmology. New fundamental cosmological parameters are introduced and evaluated. This emerging new cosmology does not seem to possess any of the controversial features of the current standard model, such as the presence of dark matter, dark energy or of a cosmological constant, the existence of the horizon problem or of an inflationary phase. Comparing our results with current conformal cosmologies in the literature, we note that our kinematic cosmology is equivalent to conformal gravity with a cosmological constant at late (or early) cosmological times. The cosmic scale factor and the evolution of the Universe are described in terms of several dimensionless quantitites, among which a new cosmological variable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em> emerges as a natural cosmic time. The mathematical connections between all these quantities are described in details and a relationship is established with the original kinematic cosmology by L. Infeld and A. Schild. The mathematical foundations of our kinematical conformal cosmology will need to be checked against current astrophysical experimental data, before this new model can become a viable alternative to the standard theory.
Generalizing the method proposed by Damour–Ruffini, we discuss Hawking radiation of a Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter (RNdS) black hole. Under the condition that total energy and charge are conserved, taking the reaction of the radiation of particles to the spacetime into consideration and considering the interrelation between the event horizon and cosmological horizon, we investigate radiation spectrum of RNdS spacetime by a new Tortoise coordinate transformation. This radiation spectrum is no longer a purely thermal spectrum. It is related to the changes in the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy corresponding the event horizon and cosmological horizon. The result satisfies the unitary principle.

We investigate transverse electromagnetic waves propagating in a plasma near the horizon of the de Sitter space. Using the 3+1 formalism we derive the relativistic two-fluid equations to take account of the effects due to the horizon and describe the set of simultaneous linear equations for the perturbations. We use a local approximation to investigate the one-dimensional radial propagation of Alfvén and high frequency electromagnetic waves and solve the dispersion relation for these waves numerically.
We employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in a given cosmological setting to argue that it is equivalent to and results in the same physical picture if one considers the deformation of the phase-space instead. To show this we use a probabilistic evolutionary process to make the solutions of these different approaches comparable. Specific model theories are used to show that the independent solutions of the resulting Wheeler–DeWitt equation are equivalent to solutions of the deformation method with different signs for the deformation parameter. We also argued that since the Wheeler–DeWitt equation is a direct consequence of diffeomorphism invariance, this equivalence is only true provided that the deformation of phase-space does not break such an invariance.
The vacuum activity generated by the curvature of the Schwarzschild black-hole geometry close to the event horizon is studied for the case of a massless, conformal scalar field. The associated approximation to the unknown, exact propagator in the Hartle–Hawking vacuum state for small values of the radial coordinate above <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> results in an analytic expression which manifestly features its dependence on the background space–time geometry. This approximation to the Hartle–Hawking scalar propagator on the Schwarzschild black-hole geometry is, for that matter, distinct from all other. It is shown that the stated approximation is valid for physical distances which range from the event horizon to values which are orders of magnitude above the scale within which quantum and backreaction effects are comparatively pronounced. An expression is obtained for the renormalised <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({ \langle\phi^2(x)\rangle}\)</span> in the Hartle–Hawking vacuum state which reproduces the established results on the event horizon and in that segment of the exterior geometry within which the approximation is valid. In contrast to previous results the stated expression has the superior feature of being entirely analytic. The effect of the manifold’s causal structure to scalar propagation is also studied.
The trans-Planckian and information loss problems are usually discussed in the literature as separate issues concerning the nature of Hawking radiation. Here we instead argue that they are intimately linked, and can be understood as “two sides of the same coin” once it is accepted that general relativity is an effective field theory.
Several features of electrostatics of point charged particles in a weak, homogeneous, gravitational field are discussed using the Rindler metric to model the gravitational field. Some previously known results are obtained by simpler and more transparent procedures and are interpreted in an intuitive manner. Specifically: (a) We discuss possible definitions of the electric field in curved spacetime (and noninertial frames), argue in favour of a specific definition for the electric field and discuss its properties. (b) We show that the electrostatic potential of a charge at rest in the Rindler frame (which is known and is usually expressed as a complicated function of the coordinates) is expressible as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> <sub>0</sub> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> is the affine parameter distance along the null geodesic from the charge to the field point. (c) This relates well with the result that the electric field lines of a charge coincide with the null geodesics; that is, both light and the electric field lines ‘bend’ in the same manner in a weak gravitational field. We provide a simple proof for this result as well as for the fact that the null geodesics (and field lines) are circles in space. (d) We obtain the sum of the electrostatic forces exerted by one charge on another in the Rindler frame and discuss its interpretation. In particular, we compare the results in the Rindler frame and in the inertial frame and discuss their consistency. (e) We show how a purely electrostatic term in the Rindler frame appears as a radiation term in the inertial frame. (In part, this arises because charges at rest in a weak gravitational field possess additional weight due to their electrostatic energy. This weight is proportional to the acceleration and falls inversely with distance—which are the usual characteristics of a radiation field.) (f) We also interpret the origin of the radiation reaction term by extending our approach to include a slowly varying acceleration. Many of these results might have possible extensions for the case of electrostatics in an arbitrary static geometry.
We apply the covariant anomaly cancellation method to compute the Hawking fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons of the Schwarzschild–de Sitter black hole. The derivation is new from the existing ones as we split the space in three different regions (near to and away from the event and cosmic horizons) and write down the covariant energy–momentum tensor using three step functions which covers the whole region leading elegantly to the conditions required to compute the Hawking fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons.
We propose a model based on a DBI action for the unification of dark matter and dark energy. This is supported by the results of the study of its background behavior at early and late times, and reinforced by the analysis of the evolution of perturbations. We also perform a Bayesian analysis to set observational constraints on the parameters of the model using type Ia SN, CMB shift and BAO data. Finally, to complete the study we investigate its kinematics aspects, such as the effective equation of state parameter, acceleration parameter and transition redshift. Particularizing those parameters for the best fit one appreciates that an effective phantom is preferred.
We introduce a dynamical model to reduce a large cosmological constant to a sufficiently small value. The basic ingredient in this model is a distinction which has been made between the two unit systems used in cosmology and particle physics. We have used a conformal invariant gravitational model to define a particular conformal frame in terms of large scale properties of the universe. It is then argued that the contributions of mass scales in particle physics to the vacuum energy density should be considered in a different conformal frame. In this manner, a decaying mechanism is presented in which the conformal factor appears as a dynamical field and plays a key role to relax a large effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we argue that this model also provides a possible explanation for the coincidence problem.
With the help of the general theory of the Heun equation, this paper completes previous work by the authors and other groups on the explicit representation of the massive gravitino propagator in four-dimensional de Sitter space. As a result of our original contribution, all weight functions which multiply the geometric invariants in the gravitino propagator are expressed through Heun functions, and the resulting plots are displayed and discussed after resorting to a suitable truncation in the series expansion of the Heun function. It turns out that there exist two ranges of values of the independent variable in which the weight functions can be divided into dominant and sub-dominant families.
In this pedagogically structured article, we describe a generalized harmonic (GH) formulation of the Einstein equations in spherical symmetry which is regular at the origin. The GH approach has attracted significant attention in numerical relativity over the past few years, especially as applied to the problem of binary inspiral and merger. A key issue when using the technique is the choice of the gauge source functions, and recent work has provided several prescriptions for gauge drivers designed to evolve these functions in a controlled way. We numerically investigate the parameter spaces of some of these drivers in the context of fully non-linear collapse of a real, massless scalar field, and determine nearly optimal parameter settings for specific situations. Surprisingly, we find that many of the drivers that perform well in 3 + 1 calculations that use Cartesian coordinates, are considerably less effective in spherical symmetry, where some of them are, in fact, unstable.
The explicit form of perturbation equation for the Ψ<sub>4</sub> Weyl scalar, containing the matter source terms, is derived for general type D spacetimes. It is described in detail the particular case of the Schwarzschild spacetime using in-going penetrating coordinates. As a practical application, we focused on the emission of gravitational waves when a black hole is perturbed by a surrounding dust-like fluid matter. The symmetries of the spacetime and the simplicity of the matter source allow, by means of a spherical harmonic decomposition, to study the problem by means of a one dimensional numerical code.
In this paper, we have studied the geometry of the five-dimensional black hole solutions in (a) Einstein–Yang–Mills–Gauss–Bonnet theory and (b) Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet theory with a cosmological constant for spherically symmetric space time. Formulating the Ruppeiner metric, we have examined the possible phase transition for both the metrics. It is found that depending on some restrictions phase transition is possible for the black holes. Also for Λ = 0 in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet black hole, the Ruppeiner metric becomes flat and hence the black hole becomes a stable one.
After a review of a traditional analysis, it is shown a variation of a more recent treatment on the spectrum of relic gravitational waves (GWs). Then, a connection between the two different treatments will be analysed. Such a connection permits to obtain an interesting equation for the inflaton field. This equation gives a value that agrees with the slow roll condition on inflation.



An alternative gravity theory is proposed which does not rely on Riemannian geometry and geodesic trajectories. The theory named periodic relativity (PR) does not use the weak field approximation and allows every two body system to deviate differently from the flat Minkowski metric. PR differs from general relativity (GR) in predictions of the proper time intervals of distant objects. PR proposes a definite connection between the proper time interval of an object and gravitational frequency shift of its constituent particles as the object travels through the gravitational field. PR is based on the dynamic weak equivalence principle which equates the gravitational mass with the relativistic mass. PR provides very accurate solutions for the Pioneer anomaly and the rotation curves of galaxies outside the framework of general relativity. PR satisfies Einstein’s field equations with respect to the three major GR tests within the solar system and with respect to the derivation of Friedmann equation in cosmology. This article defines the underlying framework of the theory.
The investigation of the stability properties of certain variants of Einstein’s static universe performed by Carneiro and Tavakol (in Stability of the Einstein static universe in the presence of vacuum energy) is generalized. It is shown that all versions of Einstein’s static universe without interaction between the two fluids it contains are unstable. Interaction between the fluids may stabilize the universe. The condition for stability by perturbation of the scale factor from its static value is deduced for a class of universe models containing those investigated by Carneiro and Tavakol. Stability of the static state requires that energy is transformed to matter during such a perturbation.
We consider the flat anisotropic Bianchi I braneworld model of the universe within the framework of low energy effective string action in four-dimensions including the leading order <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em>′ terms, two-scalar fields, their interaction, non-minimal coupling of the dark-energy scalar field to the scalar curvature and effective cosmological constant. Backward (high energy limit) and forward (low energy limit) in time analytic solutions are derived and late-time accelerated expansion was found. It is shown that during the transition from high energy limit to the low energy limit, the topology of the universe is changing in time: we have a transition from a (1 + 3) FRW homogenous and isotropic spacetime dominated by radiation to a (1 + 2) spacetime sheet dominated by phantom energy while the third spatial dimension is contracted in time. We have also found that dark matter and dark energy may be unified at early epoch in the form of radiation fluids while the late-time dynamics is governed by phantom energy and dark energy. Many interesting features are revealed.
The cosmological backreaction proposal, which attempts to account for observations without a primary dark energy source in the stress-energy tensor, has been developed and discussed by means of different approaches. Here, we focus on the concept of cosmological background solutions in order to develop a framework to study different backreaction proposals.
We show that the Gödel type metrics in three dimensions with arbitrary two dimensional background space satisfy the Einstein-perfect fluid field equations. We also show that there exists only one first order partial differential equation satisfied by the components of fluid’s velocity vector field. We then show that the same metrics solve the field equations of the topologically massive gravity where the two dimensional background geometry is a space of constant negative Gaussian curvature. We discuss the possibility that the Gödel type metrics to solve the Ricci and Cotton flow equations. When the vector field <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> is a Killing vector field, we came to the conclusion that the stationary Gödel type metrics solve the field equations of the most possible gravitational field equations where the interaction lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field and the curvature tensors.
We investigate the generic properties of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions to the field equations describing gravity minimally coupled to a nonlinear self-gravitating real scalar field. Five corollaries and a theorem on selection criteria for two- and one-parametric solutions are proven and conditions for obtaining particle-like solutions, black holes or naked singularities are derived. A series of exact solutions in closed forms including different black holes, naked singularities and particle-like solutions, all of which obey the weak energy condition at spatial infinity, are provided. Two further corollaries elaborate on the behavior of solutions at spatial infinity, critical mass, mass density, pressure and energy conditions.
We construct Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetimes joined by massless shells of matter, in the process correcting minor flaws in the similar diagrams drawn by Dray and ’t Hooft (Commun Math Phys 99:613–625, 1985), and confirming their result that such shells generate a horizon shift. We then consider shells with negative energy density, showing that the horizon shift in this case allows for travel between the heretofore causally separated exterior regions of the Schwarzschild geometry. These drawing techniques are then used to investigate the properties of successive shells, joining multiple Schwarzschild regions. Again, the presence of negative-energy shells leads to a causal connection between the exterior regions, even in (some) cases with two successive shells of equal but opposite total energy.
The algebraic study of the Bel–Robinson tensor proposed and initiated in a previous work (Ferrando and Sáez in Gen Relativ Gravit 41:1695–1715, 2009) is achieved. The canonical form of the different algebraic types is obtained in terms of Bel–Robinson eigen-tensors. An algorithmic determination of the Weyl tensor from the Bel–Robinson tensor is presented.
In this paper, we report on results in the study of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with elastic matter. We show that the behavior of elastic solutions is fundamentally different from that of perfect fluid solutions already in the case of locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I models; this is true even when the elastic material resembles a perfect fluid very closely. In particular, the approach to the initial singularity is characterized by an intricate oscillatory behavior of the scale factors, while the future asymptotic behavior is described by isotropization rates that differ significantly from those of perfect fluids.
Analytical properties of the scalar expansion in the cosmic fluid are investigated, especially near the future singularity, when the fluid possesses a constant bulk viscosity ζ. In addition, we assume that there is a Casimir-induced term in the fluid’s energy-momentum tensor, in such a way that the Casimir contributions to the energy density and pressure are both proportional to 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>4</sup>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> being the scale factor. A series expansion is worked out for the scalar expansion under the condition that the Casimir influence is small. Close to the Big Rip singularity the Casimir term has however to fade away and we obtain the same singular behavior for the scalar expansion, the scale factor, and the energy density, as in the Casimir-free viscous case.
In this work a tachyonization of the ΛCDM model for a spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker space–time is proposed. A tachyon field and a cosmological constant are considered as the sources of the gravitational field. Starting from a stability analysis and from the exact solutions for a standard tachyon field driven by a given potential, the search for a large set of cosmological models which contain the ΛCDM model is investigated. By the use of internal transformations two new kinds of tachyon fields are derived from the standard tachyon field, namely, a complementary and a phantom tachyon fields. Numerical solutions for the three kinds of tachyon fields are determined and it is shown that the standard and complementary tachyon fields reproduces the ΛCDM model as a limiting case. The standard tachyon field can also describe a transition from an accelerated to a decelerated regime, behaving as an inflationary field at early times and as a matter field at late times. The complementary tachyon field always behaves as a matter field. The phantom tachyon field is characterized by a rapid expansion where its energy density increases with time.
With the discovery of Dark Energy, Λ<sub>DE</sub>, there is now a universal length scale, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\ell_{\rm DE}=c/(\Lambda_{\rm DE} G)^{1/2}}\)</span>, associated with the universe that allows for an extension of the geodesic equations of motion. In this paper, we will study a specific class of such extensions, and show that contrary to expectations, they are not automatically ruled out by either theoretical considerations or experimental constraints. In particular, we show that while these extensions affect the motion of massive particles, the motion of massless particles are not changed; such phenomena as gravitational lensing remain unchanged. We also show that these extensions do not violate the equivalence principal, and that because <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\ell_{\rm DE}=14010^{800}_{820}}\)</span> Mpc, a specific choice of this extension can be made so that effects of this extension are not be measurable either from terrestrial experiments, or through observations of the motion of solar system bodies. A lower bound for the only parameter used in this extension is set.
The well-known energy problem is discussed in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory of gravity. We use the generalized Landau–Lifshitz energy–momentum complex in the framework of metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity to evaluate the energy density of plane symmetric solutions for some general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models. In particular, this quantity is found for some popular choices of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models. The constant scalar curvature condition and the stability condition for these models are also discussed. Further, we investigate the energy distribution of cosmic string spacetime.
We present the metric for the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 1)-dimensional charged rotating dilaton black branes with cylindrical or toroidal horizons in the background of anti-de Sitter spacetime. We find the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of the dilaton potential in all higher dimensions. We plot the Penrose diagrams of the spacetime and reveal that the spacetime geometry crucially modifies in the presence of the dilaton field. The conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the black branes are also computed.
The evolution equation for the shear is reobtained for a spherically symmetric anisotropic, viscous dissipative fluid distribution, which allows us to investigate conditions for the stability of the shear–free condition. The specific case of geodesic fluids is considered in detail, showing that the shear–free condition, in this particular case, may be unstable, the departure from the shear–free condition being controlled by the expansion scalar and a single scalar function defined in terms of the anisotropy of the pressure, the shear viscosity and the Weyl tensor or, alternatively, in terms of the anisotropy of the pressure, the dissipative variables and the energy density inhomogeneity.
We derive the generalized Friedmann equation governing the cosmological evolution inside the thick brane model in the presence of two curvature correction terms: a four-dimensional scalar curvature from induced gravity on the brane, and a five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet curvature term. We find two effective four-dimensional reductions of the generalized Friedmann equation in some limits and demonstrate that the reductions but not the generalized Friedmann equation can be rewritten as the first law of equilibrium thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of thick braneworld.
The transverse electromagnetic waves propagating in a relativistic two-fluid plasma influenced by the gravitational field of the Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter black hole has been investigated exploiting “3 + 1” split of spacetime. Reformulating the two-fluid equations, the set of simultaneous linear equations for the perturbations have been derived. Using a local approximation, the one-dimensional radial propagation of Alfvén and high frequency electromagnetic waves are investigated. The dispersion relation for these waves is obtained and solved numerically for the wave number.
An algebraic analysis of the Hamiltonian formulation of the model two-dimensional gravity is performed. The crucial fact is an exact coincidence of the Poisson brackets algebra of the secondary constraints of this Hamiltonian formulation with the SO(2,1)-algebra. The eigenvectors of the canonical Hamiltonian <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> </sub> are obtained and explicitly written in closed form.
The 1+3 covariant approach and the covariant gauge-invariant approach to perturbations are used to analyze in depth conformal transformations in cosmology. Such techniques allow us to obtain insights on the physical meaning of these transformations when applied to non-standard gravity. The results obtained lead to a number of general conclusions on the change of some key quantities describing any two conformally related cosmological models. For example, even if some of the geometrical properties of the cosmology are preserved (homogeneous and isotropic Universes are mapped into homogeneous and isotropic universes), it can happen that decelerating cosmologies can be mapped into accelerated ones. From the point of view of the cosmological perturbations it is shown how these fluctuation transform. We find that first-order vector and tensor perturbations equations are left unchanged in their structure by the conformal transformation, but this cannot be said of the scalar perturbations, which present differences in their evolutionary features. The results obtained are then explicitly interpreted and verified with the help of some clarifying examples based on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity cosmologies.
The possibility of a frame-induced violation of Lorentz invariance due to non-inertial spin-1/2 particle motion is explored in detail for muon decay while in orbit near the event horizon of a microscopic Kerr black hole. It is explicitly shown that kinematic and curvature contributions to the muon’s decay spectrum—in the absence of any unforeseen processes due to quantum gravity—lead to its stabilization at the muon’s Compton wavelength scale. This example is emblematic of the search for unambiguous indicators to critically assess current and future approaches to quantum gravity research.
The entropy density, energy density, pressure and equation of state for the gases of massless particles with spin <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em> ≤ 2 around the static spherical black hole with quintessence are investigated by using the brick-wall method. It is shown that the state equations for spin fields in curved spacetime do not take the same forms as that in flat spacetime and contain additional terms with spin dependence. Then the character of the terms and the effect of quintessence and spin on them are discussed.
An energy-momentum tensor for general relativistic spinning fluids compatible with Tulczyjew-type supplementary condition is derived from the variation of a general Lagrangian with unspecified explicit form. This tensor is the sum of a term containing the Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor and a modified perfect-fluid energy-momentum tensor in which the four-velocity is replaced by a unit four-vector in the direction of fluid momentum. The equations of motion are obtained and it is shown that they admit a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker space–time as a solution.
In the “braneworld scenario” ordinary standard model matter and non-gravitational fields are confined by some trapping mechanism to the 4-dimensional universe constituting the D3-branes which are embedded in a (4 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>)-dimensional manifold referred to as the ‘bulk’ (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> being the number of extra dimensions). The notion of particle confinement is necessary for theories with non-compact extra dimensions, otherwise, the particles would escape from our 4-dimensional world along unseen directions. In this paper, we have considered a five-dimensional warped product space-time having an exponential warping function which depends both on time as well as on the extra coordinates and a non-compact fifth dimension. Assuming that the lapse function may either be a constant or a function of both time and of the extra coordinates, we have studied the nature of the geodesics of test particles and photons and have analyzed the conditions of stability in this geometrical framework. We have also discussed the possible cosmology of the corresponding (3 + 1)-dimensional hypersurfaces.
Bound states of two weakly interactive massive particles are studied. It is assumed that the WIMPonium is formed due to the gravitational interaction, since the weak interaction can sometimes be repulsive. The lifetimes of the spontaneous emission of gravitational radiation and of the WIMPs annihilation into a pair of gravitons are computed, and are shown to be many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe.

This is an English translation of a paper by Karl Stellmacher, first published in German in 1938, in which he presented the first, correct and successful, formulation of the initial value problem for Einstein’s equations in vacuum and with a dust source. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Helmut Friedrich and Stellmacher’s brief biography written by Hubert Goenner.
A conjecture was stated in Hussain et al. (Gen Relativ Grav 41:2399, 2009), that the conformal Killing vectors form a subalgebra of the symmetries of the Lagrangian that minimizes arc length, for any spacetime. Here, a counter example is constructed to demonstrate that the above statement is not true in general for spacetimes of non-zero curvature.
We present dynamical description of gravitational collapse in view of Misner and Sharp’s formalism. Matter under consideration is a complicated fluid consistent with plane symmetry which we assume to undergo dissipation in the form of heat flow, radiation, shear and bulk viscosity. Junction conditions are studied for a general spacetime in the interior and Vaidya spacetime in the exterior regions. Dynamical equations are obtained and coupled with causal transport equations derived in context of Müller Israel Stewart theory. The role of dissipative quantities over collapse is investigated.
We show that a particle, with positive orbital angular momentum, following an outgoing null/timelike geodesic, shall never reach the closed timelike horizon present in the (4 + 1)-dimensional rotating Gödel black hole space–time. Therefore a large part of this space–time remains inaccessible to a large class of geodesic observers, depending on the conserved quantities associated with them. We discuss how this fact and the existence of the closed timelike curves present in the asymptotic region make the quantum field theoretic study of the Hawking radiation, where the asymptotic observer states are a pre-requisite, unclear. However, the semi classical approach provides an alternative to verify the Smarr formula derived recently for the rotating Gödel black hole. We present a systematic analysis of particle emissions, specifically for scalars, charged Dirac spinors and vectors, from this black hole via the semiclassical complex path method.
Quasi-black holes are objects having some of the properties of black holes but which have no horizon and are non-singular. Up till now those found have been spherical. I give solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations representing spheroidal quasi-black holes, made of electrically counterpoised dust. They contain a parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> which governs the external gravitational and electrical fields of the spheroid: as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> tends to zero those fields become spherical in spite of the spheroidal character of the source.
In this work there are proposed several new 6D brane worlds based on exact topological solutions to the vortex equations for the Abelian Higgs model, with suitable boundary conditions and symmetry breaking potentials similar to the mexican hat. Just as happens for RS domain wall brane worlds, it is shown that the massless mode of linearized gravity is localized in the neighborhood of the string–vortex solution while there are not massive bounded states. The correction to the newtonian limit of the effective 4D gravity is calculated.
A study is presented for the non linear evolution of a self gravitating distribution of matter coupled to a massless scalar field. The characteristic formulation for numerical relativity is used to follow the evolution by a sequence of light cones open to the future. Bondian frames are used to endow physical meaning to the matter variables and to the massless scalar field. Asymptotic approaches to the origin and to infinity are achieved; at the boundary surface interior and exterior solutions are matched guaranteeing the Darmois–Lichnerowicz conditions. To show how the scheme works some numerical models are discussed. We exemplify evolving scalar waves on the following fixed backgrounds: (a) an atmosphere between the boundary surface of an incompressible mixtured fluid and infinity; (b) a polytropic distribution matched to a Schwarzschild exterior; (c) a Schwarzschild–Schwarzschild spacetime. The conservation of energy, the Newman–Penrose constant preservation and other expected features are observed.
In this paper we study the validity of the generalised second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) of the universe bounded by the event horizon on the Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) brane world. The radius of the event horizon is calculated by establishing a correspondence between holographic dark energy and the effective energy density in the DGP brane world. It is shown that in the absence of cold dark matter (CDM), GSLT is always respected. In the presence of CDM, we take three different DGP models and find conditions under which GSLT holds.
The study of Brans–Dicke cosmology has attracted considerable attention in the recent years since it explains most of the important features of the progress of the universe. We discuss in this letter a homogeneous and anisotropic cosmological model in the framework of Brans–Dicke theory including together a non-linear derivative interaction which appears in theory with the Galilean shift symmetry, a Gauss–Bonnet invariant motivated from heterotic string theory which plays an important role in numerous alternatives cosmological frameworks, two scalar fields and their interactions to fit easier with universe history expansion. Several particular cases are studied and the properties related to scaling solutions and asymptotic behaviour are discussed in some details.
The possible process of creation/annihilation of traversable wormholes in the model with phantom (ghost) scalar field is described. It is shown that such process can be realized only for some special choice of a potential energy, in particular, for the Sine-Gordon potential.
We formulate a modified theory of gravity to an equivalent second order gravity theory for a Lagrangian containing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\frac{1}{R}}\)</span> terms by introducing an auxiliary variable in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic background. We present a few analytical solutions of evolution equation for the deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> as a function of the scale factor; specially in one solution, the universe evolves continuously from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> = 1 (i.e. like a radiation dominated era) to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({q= -\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> dark energy dominated late time accelerating phase when the universe is sufficiently old. The solution is supported by numerical results.
We explore the symmetry reduced form of a non-perturbative solution to the constraints of quantum gravity corresponding to quantum de Sitter space. The system has a remarkably precise analogy with the non-relativistic formulation of a particle falling in a constant gravitational field that we exploit in our analysis. We find that the solution reduces to de Sitter space in the semi-classical limit, but the uniquely quantum features of the solution have peculiar property. Namely, the unambiguous quantum structures are neither of Planck scale nor of cosmological scale. Instead, we find a periodicity in the volume of the universe whose period, using the observed value of the cosmological constant, is on the order of the volume of the proton.
We find solution to the metric function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) = 0 of charged BTZ black hole making use of the Lambert function. The condition of extremal charged BTZ black hole is determined by a non-linear relation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>) = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sup>2</sup>(1 − ln <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sup>2</sup>). Then, we study the entropy of extremal charged BTZ black hole using the entropy function approach. It is shown that this formalism works with a proper normalization of charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> for charged BTZ black hole because AdS<sub>2</sub> × S<sup>1</sup> represents near-horizon geometry of the extremal charged BTZ black hole. Finally, we introduce the Wald’s Noether formalism to reproduce the entropy of the extremal charged BTZ black hole without normalization when using the dilaton gravity approach.
We consider the spherically symmetric metric with a comoving perfect fluid and non-zero pressure—the Lemaître metric—and present it in the form of a calculational algorithm. We use it to review the definition of mass, and to look at the apparent horizon relations on the observer’s past null cone. We show that the introduction of pressure makes it difficult to separate the mass from other physical parameters in an invariant way. Under the usual mass definition, the apparent horizon relation, that relates the diameter distance to the cosmic mass, remains the same as in the Lemaître–Tolman case.
We analyse the phenomenology of a self-interacting scalar field in the context of the chameleon scenario originally proposed by Khoury and Weltman. In the absence of self-interactions, this type of scalar field can mediate long range interactions and simultaneously evade constraints from violation of the weak equivalence principle. By applying to such a scalar field the effective field theory method proposed for Einstein gravity by Goldberger and Rothstein, we give a thorough perturbative evaluation of the importance of non-derivative self-interactions in determining the strength of the chameleon mediated force in the case of orbital motion. The self-interactions are potentially dangerous as they can change the long range behaviour of the field. Nevertheless, we show that they do not lead to any dramatic phenomenological consequence with respect to the linear case and solar system constraints are fulfilled.
Using a new ansatz for solving the Einstein equations with a scalar field with inverted sign in the kinetic term (phantom field), I find a series of formulae to derive axial symmetric stationary exact solutions of the phantom fields in general relativity. I focus on the solutions which represent wormholes. The procedure presented in this work allows to derive new exact solutions up to very simple integrations. Among other results, I find exact rotating solutions containing magnetic monopoles, dipoles, etc., coupled to phantom scalar and to gravitational multipole fields.
We derive the interior Kottler solution of the incompressible fluid and show that the bending of light in this solution does depend on the cosmological constant.
We discuss the cosmological reconstruction in modified Gauss–Bonnet and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravities. Two alternative representations of the action (with and without auxiliary scalar) are considered. The approximate description of deceleration–acceleration transition cosmologies is reconstructed. It is shown that cosmological solution containing Big Bang and Big Rip singularities may be reconstructed only using the representation with the auxiliary field. The analytical description of the deceleration–acceleration transition cosmology in modified Gauss–Bonnet gravity is demonstrated to be impossible at sufficiently general conditions.

The mathematical theory of gravitational lensing has revealed many generic and global properties. Beginning with multiple imaging, we review Morse-theoretic image counting formulas and lower bound results, and complex-algebraic upper bounds in the case of single and multiple lens planes. We discuss recent advances in the mathematics of stochastic lensing, discussing a general formula for the global expected number of minimum lensed images as well as asymptotic formulas for the probability densities of the microlensing random time delay functions, random lensing maps, and random shear, and an asymptotic expression for the global expected number of micro-minima. Multiple imaging in optical geometry and a spacetime setting are treated. We review global magnification relation results for model-dependent scenarios and cover recent developments on universal local magnification relations for higher order caustics.
Microlensing is now a very popular observational astronomical technique. The investigations accessible through this effect range from the dark matter problem to the search for extra-solar planets. In this review, the techniques to search for microlensing effects and to determine optical depths through the monitoring of large samples of stars will be described. The consequences of the published results on the knowledge of the Milky-Way structure and its dark matter component will be discussed. The difficulties and limitations of the ongoing programs and the perspectives of the microlensing optical depth technique as a probe of the Galaxy structure will also be detailed.
The ‘most curious’ effect of the bending of light by the gravity of stars has evolved into a successful technique unlike any other for studying planets within the Milky Way and even other galaxies. With a sensitivity to cool planets around low-mass stars even below the mass of Earth, gravitational microlensing fits in between other planet search techniques to form a complete picture of planet parameter space, which is required to understand their origin in general, that of habitable planets more particularly, and that of planet Earth especially. Current campaigns need to evolve from first detections to obtaining a sample with well-understood selection bias that allows to draw firm conclusions about the planet populations. With planetary signals being a transient phenomenon, gravitational microlensing is a driver for new technologies in scheduling and management of non-proprietary heterogeneous telescope networks, and can serve to demonstrate forefront science live to the general public.
Pixel lensing is gravitational microlensing of unresolved stars. The main target explored up to now has been the nearby galaxy of Andromeda, M31. The scientific issues of interest are the search for dark matter in form of compact halo objects, the study of the characteristics of the luminous lens and source populations and the possibility of detecting extra-solar (and extra-galactic) planets. In the present work we intend to give an updated overview of the observational status in this field.
Quasar microlensing deals with the effect of compact objects along the line of sight on the apparent brightness of the background quasars. Due to the relative motion between quasar, lenses and observer, the microlensing magnification changes with time which results in uncorrelated brightness variations in the various images of multiple quasar systems. The amplitudes of the signal can be more than a magnitude with time scales of weeks to months to years. The effect is due to the “granular” nature of the gravitational microlenses—stars or other compact objects in the stellar mass range. Quasar microlensing allows to study the quasar accretion disk with a resolution of tens of microarcseconds, hence quasar microlensing can be used to explore an astrophysical field that is hardly accessible by any other means. Quasar microlensing can also be used to study the lensing objects in a statistical sense, their nature (compact or smoothly distributed, normal stars or dark matter) as well as transverse velocities. Quasar microlensing light curves are now being obtained from monitoring programs across the electromagnetic spectrum from the radio through the infrared and optical range to the X-ray regime. Recently, spectroscopic microlensing was successfully applied, it provides quantitative comparisons with quasar/accretion disk models. There are now more than a handful of systems with several-year long light curves and significant microlensing signal, lending to detailed analysis. This review summarizes the current state of the art of quasar microlensing and shows that at this point in time, observational monitoring programs and complementary intense simulations provide a scenario where some of the early promises of quasar microlensing can be quantitatively applied. It has been shown, e.g., that smaller sources display more violent microlensing variability, first quantitative comparison with accretion disk models has been achieved, and quasar microlensing has been used to determine the fraction of dark matter in a lensing galaxy for the first time. This is the quantitative beginning. The future of quasar microlensing is bright.
I review methods for modeling gravitational lens systems comprising multiple images of a background source surrounding a foreground galaxy. In a Bayesian framework, the likelihood is driven by the nature of the data, which in turn depends on whether the source is point-like or extended. The prior encodes astrophysical expectations about lens galaxy mass distributions, either through a careful choice of model families, or through an explicit Bayesian prior applied to under-constrained free-form models. We can think about different lens modeling methods in terms of their choices of likelihoods and priors.
Weak gravitational lensing is rapidly becoming one of the principal probes of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. In this brief review we outline how weak lensing helps determine the structure of dark matter halos, measure the expansion rate of the universe, and distinguish between modified gravity and dark energy explanations for the acceleration of the universe. We also discuss requirements on the control of systematic errors so that the systematics do not appreciably degrade the power of weak lensing as a cosmological probe.
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) represents a unique source for the study of gravitational lensing. It is extended across the entire sky, partially polarized, located at the extreme distance of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 1,100, and is thought to have the simple, underlying statistics of a Gaussian random field. Here we review the weak lensing of the CMB, highlighting the aspects which differentiate it from the weak lensing of other sources, such as galaxies. We discuss the statistics of the lensing deflection field which remaps the CMB, and the corresponding effect on the power spectra. We then focus on methods for reconstructing the lensing deflections, describing efficient quadratic maximum-likelihood estimators and delensing. We end by reviewing recent detections and observational prospects.
While tested to a high level of accuracy in the Solar system, general relativity is under the spotlight of both theoreticians and observers on larger scales, mainly because of the need to introduce dark matter and dark energy in the cosmological model. This text reviews the main tests of general relativity focusing on the large scale structure and more particularly weak lensing. The complementarity with other tests (including those on Solar system scales and the equivalence principle) is discussed.
This review surveys some recent developments concerning the effect of the cosmological constant on the bending of light by a spherical mass in Kottler (Schwarzschild–de Sitter) spacetime. Some proposals of how such an effect may be put into a setting of gravitational lensing in cosmology are also discussed. The picture that emerges from this review is that it seems fair to assert that the contribution of Λ to the bending of light has by now been well established, while putting the Λ light-bending terms into a cosmological context is still subject to some interpretation and requires further work and clarification.
We review the theoretical aspects of gravitational lensing by black holes, and discuss the perspectives for realistic observations. We will first treat lensing by spherically symmetric black holes, in which the formation of infinite sequences of higher order images emerges in the clearest way. We will then consider the effects of the spin of the black hole, with the formation of giant higher order caustics and multiple images. Finally, we will consider the perspectives for observations of black hole lensing, from the detection of secondary images of stellar sources and spots on the accretion disk to the interpretation of iron K-lines and direct imaging of the shadow of the black hole.
Many exotic astronomical objects have been introduced. Usually the objects have masses, therefore they may act as gravitational lenses. We briefly discuss gravitational lensing with cosmic strings. As is well-known, dark matter is one of the most important components of the Universe. Recent computer simulations indicate that dark matter may form clumps. We review gravitational lensing (including microlensing) for the clumps.
In this essay, we argue that the emergence of classically connected spacetimes is intimately related to the quantum entanglement of degrees of freedom in a non-perturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling the degrees of freedom associated with two regions of spacetime results in these regions pulling apart and pinching off from each other in a way that can be quantified by standard measures of entanglement.
Are there any degrees of freedom on the black hole horizon? Using the ‘membrane paradigm’ we can reproduce coarse-grained physics outside the hole by assuming a fictitious membrane just outside the horizon. But to solve the information puzzle we need ‘real’ degrees of freedom at the horizon, which can modify Hawking’s evolution of quantum modes. We argue that recent results on gravitational microstates imply a set of real degrees of freedom just outside the horizon; the state of the hole is a linear combination of rapidly oscillating gravitational solutions with support concentrated just outside the horizon radius. The collective behavior of these microstate solutions may give a realization of the membrane paradigm, with the fictitious membrane now replaced by real, explicit degrees of freedom.
While extreme black hole spacetimes with smooth horizons are known at the level of mathematics, we argue that the horizons of physical extreme black holes are effectively singular. Test particles encounter a singularity the moment they cross the horizon, and only objects with significant back-reaction can fall across a smooth (now non-extreme) horizon. As a result, classical interior solutions for extreme black holes are theoretical fictions that need not be reproduced by any quantum mechanical model. This observation suggests that significant quantum effects might be visible outside extreme or nearly extreme black holes. It also suggests that the microphysics of such black holes may be very different from that of their Schwarzschild cousins.
It is shown that torsion is required for a complete theory of gravitation, and that without it, the equations of gravitation violate fundamental laws. In the first case, we are reminded that, in the absence of external forces, the correct conservation law of total angular momentum arises only if torsion, whose origin is intrinsic spin, is included into gravitation. The second case considers the “mass reversal” transformation. It has been known that under a global chiral transformation and “mass to negative mass” transformation, the Dirac equation is invariant. But global transformations violate special relativity, so this transformation must be made local. It is shown that the torsion is the gauge field for this local invariance.
The present-day Universe appears to be homogeneous on very large scales. Yet when the casual structure of the early Universe is considered, it becomes apparent that the early Universe must have been highly inhomogeneous. The current paradigm attempts to answer this problem by postulating the inflation mechanism However, inflation in order to start requires a homogeneous patch of at least the horizon size. This paper examines if dynamical processes of the early Universe could lead to homogenization. In the past similar studies seem to imply that the set of initial conditions that leads to homogenization is of measure zero. This essay proves contrary: a set of initial conditions for spontaneous homogenization of cosmological models can form a set of non-zero measure.
The relativistic theory of elasticity is reviewed within the spherically symmetric context with a view towards the modeling of star interiors possessing elastic properties such as the ones expected in neutron stars. Emphasis is placed on generality in the main sections of the paper, and the results are then applied to specific examples. Along the way, a few general results for spacetimes admitting isometries are reviewed, and their consequences are fully exploited in the case of spherical symmetry relating them next to the the case in which the material content of the spacetime is some elastic material. Specific examples are provided satisfying the dominant energy condition and admitting a constitutive equation, including a static two-layer star ‘toy model’ consisting of an elastic core surrounded by a perfect fluid corresponding to the interior Schwarzschild solution matched to the vacuum Schwarzschild solution. This paper extends and generalizes the pioneering work by Magli and Kijowski (Gen Relat Gravit 24:139, 1992), Magli (Gen Relat Gravit 25:1277, 1993; 25:441, 1993), and complements, in a sense, that by Karlovini and Samuelsson in their interesting series of papers (Karlovini and Samuelsson in Class Quantum Grav 20:363, 2003; 21:1559, 21:4531, 2004).
We study the general properties of fluid spheres satisfying the heuristic assumption that theirs areal and proper radius are equal (the Euclidean condition). Dissipative and non-dissipative models are considered. In the latter case, all models are necessarily geodesic and a subclass of the Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi solution is obtained. In the dissipative case solutions are non-geodesic and are characterized by the fact that all non-gravitational forces acting on any fluid element produces a radial three-acceleration independent on its inertial mass.
We study the effects of a time-varying gravitomagnetic field on the motion of test particles. Starting from recent results, we consider the gravitomagnetic field of a source whose spin angular momentum has a linearly time-varying magnitude. The acceleration due to such a time-varying gravitomagnetic field is considered as a perturbation of the Newtonian motion, and we explicitly evaluate the effects of this perturbation on the Keplerian elements of a closed orbit. The theoretical predictions are compared with actual astronomical and astrophysical scenarios, both in the solar system and in binary pulsars systems, in order to evaluate the impact of these effects on real systems.
We examine a Lagrangian formulation of gravity based on an approach analogous to electromagnetism, called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gravitoelectromagnetism</em> (GEM). The gravitational analogue of the electromagnetic field tensor is a three-index tensor, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal {F}_{\mu\nu\lambda}}\)</span>, defined in terms of a two-index gravitoelectromagnetic potential, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathcal {A}_{\mu\nu}}\)</span>. The energy-momentum tensor is derived and is symmetric. We construct a Lagrangian which allows us to describe interactions between fermions, photons and gravitons. We calculate transition amplitudes of various processes involving gravitons: gravitational Møller scattering, gravitational Compton scattering, and the graviton photoproduction.
The static spherically symmetric solution for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> ± <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> <sup>4</sup>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> model of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity is investigated. We obtain the metric for space-time in the solar system that reduces to the Schwarzschild metric, when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> tends to zero. For the obtained metric, the deviation from Einstein gravity is very small. This result is different from the other results have been obtained by equivalence between <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity and scalar tensor theory. Also it is shown that the vacuum solution in the solar system depends on the shape of matter distribution which differ from the Einstein’s gravity.
Special solutions of the LTB family representing collapsing over-dense regions corresponding to asymptotically closed, open, or flat FRW models are found. These solutions may be considered as representing dynamical mass condensations leading to black holes immersed in a FRW universe. We study the dynamics of the collapsing region, and its density profile. The question of the strength of the central singularity and its nakedness, as well as the existence of an apparent horizon and an event horizon is dealt with in detail, shedding light to the notion of cosmological black holes. Differences to the Schwarzschild black hole are addressed.
A number of misunderstandings about modeling the apparent accelerated expansion of the Universe and about the ‘weak singularity’ are clarified: (1) Of the five definitions of the deceleration parameter given by Hirata and Seljak (HS), only <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>1</sub> is a correct invariant measure of acceleration/deceleration of expansion. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>3</sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>4</sub> are unrelated to acceleration in an inhomogeneous model. (2) The averaging over directions involved in the definition of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>4</sub> does not correspond to what is done in observational astronomy. (3) HS’s equation (38) connecting <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>4</sub> to the flow invariants gives self-contradictory results when applied at the centre of symmetry of the Lemaître–Tolman (L–T) model. The intermediate equation (31) that determines <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>3'</sub> is correct, but approximate, so it cannot be used for determining the sign of the deceleration parameter. Even so, at the centre of symmetry of the L–T model, it puts no limitation on the sign of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> <sub>3'</sub>(0). (4) The ‘weak singularity’ of Vanderveld et al. is a conical profile of mass density at the centre—a perfectly acceptable configuration. (5) The so-called ‘critical point’ in the equations of the ‘inverse problem’ for a central observer in an L–T model is a manifestation of the apparent horizon (AH)—a common property of the past light cones in zero-lambda L–T models, perfectly manageable if the equations are correctly integrated.
Circular orbits of spinning test particles and their stability in Schwarzschild-like backgrounds are investigated. For these space–times the equations of motion admit solutions representing circular orbits with particles spins being constant and normal to the plane of orbits. For the de Sitter background the orbits are always stable with particle velocity and momentum being co-linear along them. The world-line deviation equations for particles of the same spin-to-mass ratios are solved and the resulting deviation vectors are used to study the stability of orbits. It is shown that the orbits are stable against radial perturbations. The general criterion for stability against normal perturbations is obtained. Explicit calculations are performed in the case of the Schwarzschild space–time leading to the conclusion that the orbits are stable.
We apply the Effective Field Theory approach to General Relativity, introduced by Goldberger and Rothstein, to study point-like and string-like sources in the context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Within this framework we compute the classical energy-momentum tensor renormalization to first Post-Newtonian order or, in the case of extra scalar fields, up to first order in the (non-derivative) trilinear interaction terms: this allows to write down the corrections to the standard (Newtonian) gravitational potential and to the extra-scalar potential. In the case of one-dimensional extended sources we give an alternative derivation of the renormalization of the string tension enabling a re-analysis of the discrepancy between the results obtained by Dabholkar and Harvey in one paper and by Buonanno and Damour in another, already discussed in the latter.
Intermediate mass black holes may be formed through repeated coalescences of compact objects or through the direct collapse of a hypermassive star formed through runaway collisions of main sequence stars. The gravitational wave signature of these two formation scenarios will be different. Here we present an initial study of the waveform generated during the direct axisymmetric collapse of a hypermassive star in order to facilitate searches for this source. We approximate the collapse of the core as an axisymmetric Newtonian free-fall of a rotating relativistic degenerate iron core. The collapse waveform can be reasonably well modeled by an exponential growth.

This is an English translation of a paper by Władysław Ślebodziński, first published in French in 1931, in which he introduced the general definition of what is today called the Lie derivative of tensors (strangely enough, he gave no name to this object). The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Andrzej Trautman and Ślebodziński’s brief biography written by Witold Roter.


It has been shown that for each Killing–Yano (KY)-form accepted by an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional (pseudo)Riemannian manifold of arbitrary signature, two different gravitational currents can be defined. Conservation of the currents are explicitly proved by showing co-exactness of the one and co-closedness of the other. Some general geometrical facts implied by these conservation laws are also elucidated. In particular, the conservation of the one-form currents implies that the scalar curvature of the manifold is a flow invariant for all of its Killing vector fields. It also directly follows that, while all KY-forms and their Hodge duals on a constant curvature manifold are the eigenforms of the Laplace–Beltrami operator, for an Einstein manifold this is certain only for KY 1-forms, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> − 1)-forms and their Hodge duals.
We show that the standard perfect fluid paradigm is not necessarily a valid description of a curved space steady state gravitational source. Simply by virtue of not being flat, curved space geometries have to possess intrinsic length scales, and such length scales can affect the fluid structure. For modes of wavelength of order or greater than such scales eikonalized geometrical optics cannot apply and rays are not geodesic. A set of wave mode rays that would all be geodesic in flat space (where there are no intrinsic length scales) and form a flat space perfect fluid would not all remain geodesic or of the perfect fluid form when the system is covariantized to curved space. Covariantizing thus entails not only the replacing of flat space functions by covariant ones, but also the introduction of intrinsic scales that were absent in flat space. In principle it is thus unreliable to construct the curved space energy–momentum tensor as the covariant generalization of a geodesic-based flat spacetime energy–momentum tensor. By constructing the partition function as an incoherent average over a complete set of modes of a scalar field propagating in a curved space background, we show that for the specific case of a static, spherically symmetric geometry, the steady state energy–momentum tensor that ensues will in general be of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({T_{\mu\nu}=(\rho+p)U_{\mu}U_{\nu}+pg_{\mu\nu}+\pi_{\mu\nu}}\)</span> where the anisotropic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> is a symmetric, traceless rank two tensor which obeys <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({U^{\mu}\pi_{\mu\nu}=0}\)</span> . Such a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> type term is absent for an incoherently averaged steady state fluid in a spacetime where there are no intrinsic length scales, and in principle would thus be missed in a covariantizing of a flat spacetime <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub>. While the significance of such <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> type terms would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis, through the use of kinetic theory we reassuringly find that the effect of such <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> type terms is small for weak gravity stars where perfect fluid sources are commonly used.
According to several authors, gravity might be a long-wavelength phenomenon emerging in some ‘hydrodynamic limit’ from the same physical, flat-space vacuum viewed as a form of superfluid medium. In this framework, light might propagate in an effective acoustic geometry and exhibit a tiny anisotropy that could be measurable in the present ether-drift experiments. By accepting this view of the vacuum, one should also consider the possibility of sizeable random fluctuations of the signal that reflect the stochastic nature of the underlying ‘quantum ether’ and could be erroneously interpreted as instrumental noise. To test the present interpretation, we have extracted the mean amplitude of the signal from various experiments with different systematics, operating both at room temperature and in the cryogenic regime. They all give the same consistent value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\langle A \rangle ={\mathcal O}(10^{-15})}\)</span> which is precisely the magnitude expected in an emergent-gravity approach, for an apparatus placed on the Earth’s surface. Since physical implications could be substantial, it would be important to obtain more direct checks from the instantaneous raw data and, possibly, with new experimental set-ups operating in gravity-free environments.
We generalize the 2-codimensional quantum cosmological model with the vacuum seed instanton to that with a non-vacuum seed instanton associated with the Gibbons–Townsend monopole. The confusion in the literature that substituting a field configuration into an action and varying that action is not equivalent to substituting it into the field equations is clarified.
We demonstrate that from the first order formulation of the Einstein– Cartan action it is possible to derive the basic differential identity that leads to translational invariance of the action in the tangent space. The transformations of fields is written explicitly for both the first and second order formulations and the group properties of transformations are studied. This, combined with the preliminary results from the Hamiltonian formulation (Kiriushcheva and Kuzmin in arXiv:0907.1553 [gr-qc]), allows us to conclude that without any modification, the Einstein–Cartan action in any dimension higher than two possesses not only rotational invariance but also a form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">translational invariance in the tangent space</em>. We argue that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> only a complete Hamiltonian analysis can unambiguously give an answer to the question of what a gauge symmetry is, but also the pure Lagrangian methods allow us to find the same gauge symmetry from the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">basic</em> differential identities.
We investigate dynamics of (4 + 1) and (5 + 1) dimensional flat anisotropic Universe filled with a perfect fluid in the Gauss–Bonnet gravity. An analytical solutions valid for particular values of the equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> = 1/3 have been found. For other values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> structure of cosmological singularity have been studied numerically. We found that for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> &gt; 1/3 the singularity is isotropic. Several important differences between (4 + 1) and (5 + 1) dimensional cases are discussed.
In a recent paper (Sharif and Shamir in Class. Quantum Grav. 26:235020, 2009), we have studied the vacuum solutions of Bianchi types <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> spacetimes in the framework of metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. Here we extend this work to perfect fluid solutions. For this purpose, we take stiff matter to find energy density and pressure of the universe. In particular, we find two exact solutions in each case which correspond to two models of the universe. The first solution gives a singular model while the second solution provides a non-singular model. The physical behavior of these models has been discussed using some physical quantities. Also, the function of the Ricci scalar is evaluated.
We derive the Kerr solution in a pedagogically transparent way, using physical symmetry and gauge arguments to reduce the candidate metric to just two unknowns. The resulting field equations are then easy to obtain, and solve. Separately, we transform the Kerr metric to Schwarzschild frame to exhibit its limits in that familiar setting.
We study a scalar field theory with a non-standard kinetic term minimally coupled to gravity. We establish the existence of compact boson stars, that is, static solutions with compact support of the full system with self-gravitation taken into account. Concretely, there exist two types of solutions, namely compact balls on the one hand, and compact shells on the other hand. The compact balls have a naked singularity at the center. The inner boundary of the compact shells is singular, as well, but it is, at the same time, a Killing horizon. These singular, compact shells therefore resemble black holes.
With reference to the recently published article (Abdujabbarov et al. in Gen Relativ Gravit 40:2515–2532, 2008), we question the correctness of the method employed and the physical consistency of the claimed results.
The main goal of this paper is to get in a straightforward form the field equations in metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, using elementary variational principles and adding a boundary term in the action, instead of the usual treatment in an equivalent scalar–tensor approach. We start with a brief review of the Einstein–Hilbert action, together with the Gibbons–York–Hawking boundary term, which is mentioned in some literature, but is generally missing. Next we present in detail the field equations in metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, including the discussion about boundaries, and we compare with the Gibbons–York–Hawking term in General Relativity. We notice that this boundary term is necessary in order to have a well defined extremal action principle under metric variation.
Recently, Horava proposed a non-relativistic renormalisable theory of gravitation which reduces to Einstein general relativity at large distances but violate Lorentz invariance at small distances. In this paper, we consider the quark–hadron phase transition in Horava–Lifshitz cosmology within an effective model of quantum chromodynamics. We study the evolution of the physical quantities relevant to the physical description of the early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and the scale factor before, during, and after the phase transition and investigate the effects of the dynamical coupling constant λ and the 1/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup>4</sup> term on the cosmological phase transition.
The purpose of the paper is fivefold: (a) Argue that the question in the title can be presented in a meaningful manner and that it requires an answer. (b) Discuss the conventional answers and explain why they are unsatisfactory. (c) Suggest that a key ingredient in the answer could be the instability arising due to the ‘wrong’ sign in the Hilbert action for the kinetic energy term corresponding to expansion factor. (d) Describe how this idea connects up with another peculiar feature of our universe, viz. it spontaneously became more and more classical in the course of evolution. (e) Provide a speculative but plausible scenario, based on the thermodynamic perspective of gravity, in which one has the hope for relating the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time.
We propose a phantom crossing Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model. In our model, the effective equation of state of the DGP gravity crosses the phantom divide line. We demonstrate crossing of the phantom divide does not occur within the framework of the original DGP model or the DGP model developed by Dvali and Turner. By extending their model, we construct a model that realizes crossing of the phantom divide. We find that the smaller the value of the new introduced parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em> is, the older epoch crossing of the phantom divide occurs in. Our model can account for late-time acceleration of the universe without dark energy. We investigate and show the property of Phantom crossing DGP model.
We study a conjecture involving the invariant volume of the past light-cone from an arbitrary observation point back to a fixed initial value surface. The conjecture is that a fourth order differential operator which occurs in the theory of conformal anomalies gives 8<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em> when acted upon the invariant volume of the past light-cone. We show that an extended version of the conjecture is valid for an arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic geometry. First order perturbation theory about flat spacetime reveals a violation of the conjecture which, however, vanishes for any vacuum solution of the Einstein equation. These results may be significant for constructing quantum gravitational observables, for quantifying the back-reaction on spacetime expansion and for alternate gravity models which feature a timelike vector field.
In this article we study the quantization of a free real scalar field on a class of noncommutative manifolds, obtained via formal deformation quantization using triangular Drinfel’d twists. We construct deformed quadratic action functionals and compute the corresponding equation of motion operators. The Green’s operators and the fundamental solution of the deformed equation of motion are obtained in terms of formal power series. It is shown that, using the deformed fundamental solution, we can define deformed *-algebras of field observables, which in general depend on the spacetime deformation parameter. This dependence is absent in the special case of Killing deformations, which include in particular the Moyal-Weyl deformation of the Minkowski spacetime.
We discuss a new solution, admitting the existence of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dS</em> <sub>4</sub> branes, in five-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory. It is shown that, due to a special form of a bulk scalar field potential, for certain values of the model parameters the effective cosmological constant can be made small on the brane, where the hierarchy problem of gravitational interaction is solved. We also discuss new stabilization mechanism which is based on the use of auxiliary fields.
We examine the radial asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi dust models by looking at their covariant scalars along radial rays, which are spacelike geodesics parametrized by proper length <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em>, orthogonal to the 4-velocity and to the orbits of SO(3). By introducing quasi-local scalars defined as integral functions along the rays, we obtain a complete and covariant representation of the models, leading to an initial value parametrization in which all scalars can be given by scaling laws depending on two metric scale factors and two basic initial value functions. Considering regular “open” LTB models whose space slices allow for a diverging <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em>, we provide the conditions on the radial coordinate so that its asymptotic limit corresponds to the limit as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ℓ</em> → ∞. The “asymptotic state” is then defined as this limit, together with asymptotic series expansion around it, evaluated for all metric functions, covariant scalars (local and quasi-local) and their fluctuations. By looking at different sets of initial conditions, we examine and classify the asymptotic states of parabolic, hyperbolic and open elliptic models admitting a symmetry center. We show that in the radial direction the models can be asymptotic to any one of the following spacetimes: FLRW dust cosmologies with zero or negative spatial curvature, sections of Minkowski flat space (including Milne’s space), sections of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal manifold or self-similar dust solutions.
We show that the diffeomorphism anomaly together with the trace anomaly reveal a chiral Virasoro algebra near the event horizon of a black hole. This algebra is the same irrespective of whether the anomaly is covariant or consistent, thereby manifesting its universal character and the fact that only the outgoing modes are relevant near the horizon. Our analysis therefore clarifies the role of the trace anomaly in the diffeomorphism anomaly approach [Robinson and Wilczek in Phys. Rev. Lett. 95:011303, 2005; Iso et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 96:151302, 2006; Banerjee and Kulkarni in Phys. Rev. D 77:024018, 2008; Gangopadhyay and Kulkarni in Phys. Rev. D 77:024038, 2008] to the Hawking radiation.
We study effects of cosmic fluids on finite-time future singularities in modified <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>)-gravity, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> are the Ricci scalar and the Gauss–Bonnet invariant, respectively. We consider the fluid equation of state in the general form, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>), and we suppose the existence of a bulk viscosity. We investigate quintessence region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> &gt; −1) and phantom region (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> &lt; −1) and the possibility to change or avoid the singularities in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>)-gravity. Finally, we study the inclusion of quantum effects in large curvature regime.
We present perturbative charged rotating 5D Einstein-Maxwell black holes with spherical horizon topology. The electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> is the perturbative parameter, the perturbations being performed up to 4th order. The expressions for the relevant physical properties of these black holes are given. The gyromagnetic ratio <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>, in particular, is explicitly shown to be non-constant in higher order, and thus to deviate from its lowest order value, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> = 3. Comparison of the perturbative analytical solutions with their non-perturbative numerical counterparts shows remarkable agreement.
This paper discusses a new type of thin-shell wormhole constructed by applying the cut-and-paste technique to two copies of a charged black hole in generalized dilaton-axion gravity, which was inspired by low-energy string theory. After analyzing various aspects of this thin-shell wormhole, we discuss its stability to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations.
Recently, an extension of the geodesic equations of motion using the Dark Energy length scale was proposed. Here, we apply this extension to analyzing the motion of test particles at the galactic scale and longer. A cosmological check of the extension is made using the observed rotational velocity curves and core sizes of 1,393 spiral galaxies. We derive the density profile of a model galaxy using this extension, and with it, we calculate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em> <sub>8</sub> to be 0.73<sub>±0.12</sub>; this is within experimental error of the WMAP value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({0.761_{-0.048}^{+0.049}}\)</span>. We then calculate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sub>200</sub> to be 206<sub>±53</sub> kpc, which is in reasonable agreement with observations.
There are exact solutions to Einstein’s equations with negative cosmological constant that represent black holes whose event horizons are manifolds of negative curvature, the so-called topological black holes. Among these solutions there is one, the massless topological black hole, whose mass is equal to zero. Hod proposes that in the semiclassical limit the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies determine the entropy spectrum of the black holes. Taking into account this proposal, we calculate the entropy spectrum of the massless topological black hole and we compare with the results on the entropy spectra of other topological black holes.
Recently it has been shown that despite previous claims the cosmological constant affects light bending. In the present article we study light bending and the advance of Mercury’s perihelion in the context of the Newtonian limit of the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime employing the special relativistic equivalence of mass and energy. In both cases, up to a constant factor, we find the same results as in the full general relativistic treatment of the same phenomena. These approximate and intuitive arguments demonstrate clearly what effects should have been expected from the presence of Λ in the general relativistic treatment of these phenomena.
The Lie symmetries of the geodesic equations in a Riemannian space are computed in terms of the special projective group and its degenerates (affine vectors, homothetic vector and Killing vectors) of the metric. The Noether symmetries of the same equations are given in terms of the homothetic and the Killing vectors of the metric. It is shown that the geodesic equations in a Riemannian space admit three linear first integrals and two quadratic first integrals. We apply the results in the case of Einstein spaces, the Schwarzschild spacetime and the Friedman Robertson Walker spacetime. In each case the Lie and the Noether symmetries are computed explicitly together with the corresponding linear and quadratic first integrals.


We give a pedagogical introduction into an old, but unfortunately not commonly known formulation of GR in terms of self-dual two-forms due to in particular Jerzy Plebański. Our presentation is rather explicit in that we show how the familiar textbook solutions: Schwarzschild, Volkoff–Oppenheimer, as well as those describing the Newtonian limit, a gravitational wave and the homogeneous isotropic Universe can be obtained within this formalism. Our description shows how Plebański formulation gives quite an economical alternative to the usual metric and frame-based schemes for deriving Einstein equations.
The linearized field equations of quadratic gravitation in stationary space-time are written in quasi-Maxwell form. The rotation of the polarization plane for an electromagnetic wave propagating in the gravito-electromagnetic field caused by a rotating gravitational lens is discussed. The influences of the Yukawa potential in quadratic gravitation on the gravitational Faraday rotation are investigated.
Motivated by a recent work of one of us (Sheykhi in Phys Rev D 81: 023525, 2010), we extend it by using quantum (or entropy) corrected new agegraphic dark energy in the Brans–Dicke cosmology. The correction terms are motivated from the loop quantum gravity which is one of the competitive theories of quantum gravity. Taking the non-flat background spacetime along with the conformal age of the universe as the length scale, we derive the dynamical equation of state of dark energy and the deceleration parameter. An important consequence of this study is the phantom divide scenario with entropy-corrected new agegraphic dark energy. Moreover, we assume a system of dark matter, radiation and dark energy, while the later interacts only with dark matter. We obtain some essential expressions related with dark energy dynamics. The cosmic coincidence problem is also resolved in our model.
Recently, a non-relativistic renormalizable theory of gravity has been proposed by Ho<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ř</em>ava. This theory is essentially a field theoretic model for a UV complete theory of gravity and it reduces to Einstein’s general relativity at large distances. Subsequently, Cai and his collaborators have obtained black hole solution in this gravity theory and studied the thermodynamic properties of the black hole solutions. In present work, we investigate the geometric thermodynamics of the above black hole solutions and examine the possibilities of any phase transition.
Here we show that there exist closed timelike curves in Gödel spacetime with total acceleration less than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({2\pi\sqrt{9+6\sqrt{3}}}\)</span>. This settles a question posed by Malament (J Math Phys 26:774–777, 1985; J Math Phys 28:2427–2430, 1987).
Cosmologies including continuous matter creation are able to reproduce the main properties of the standard <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em>CDM model, in particular in cases where the particle and entropy production rates are equal. These specific models, characterized by a mass density equal to the critical value, behave like the standard <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em>CDM model at early times whereas their late evolution is similar to the steady-state cosmology. The maximum amplitude of density fluctuations in these models depends on the adopted creation rate, related here to the parameter Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> </sub> and this limitation could be a difficulty for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in this class of universe. Additional problems are related with predictions either of the random peculiar velocities of galaxies or the present density of massive clusters of galaxies, both being largely overestimated with respect to observational data.
In this paper, we study dynamics of the charged plane symmetric gravitational collapse. For this purpose, we discuss non-adiabatic flow of a viscous fluid and deduce the results for adiabatic case. The Einstein and Maxwell field equations are formulated for general plane symmetric spacetime in the interior. Junction conditions between the interior and exterior regions are derived. For the non-adiabatic case, the exterior is taken as plane symmetric charged Vaidya spacetime while for the adiabatic case, it is described charged plane symmetric spacetime. Using Misner and Sharp formalism, we obtain dynamical equations to investigate the effects of different forces over the rate of collapse. In non-adiabatic case, a dynamical equation is joined with transport equation of heat flux. Finally, a relation between the Weyl tensor and energy density is found.
We covariantly modify the Einstein–Hilbert action such that the modified action perturbatively resolves the anomalous rotational velocity curve of the spiral galaxies and gives rise to the Tully–Fisher relation, and dynamically generates the cosmological constant. This modification requires introducing a single new universal parameter. It requires inclusion of neither dark matter nor dark energy.
Some features of hydro- and thermodynamics, as applied to atmospheres and to stellar structures, are puzzling. 1. The suggestion, first made by Laplace, that our atmosphere has an adiabatic temperature distribution, is confirmed for the lower layers, but the reason why it should be so is difficult to understand. 2. The standard treatment of relativistic thermodynamics does not allow for a systematic treatment of mixtures, such as the mixture of a perfect gas with radiation. 3. The concept of mass in applications of general relativity to stellar structures is less than completely satisfactory. 4. Arguments in which a concept of energy plays a role, in the context of hydro-thermodynamical systems and gravitation, are not always convincing. It was proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation of these matters. In this second article of a series we propose to base criteria of stability on the hamiltonian functional that is provided by the variational principle, to replace the reliance that has often been placed on ad hoc definitions of the “energy”. We introduce a new virial principle that is formulated entirely within the Eulerian description of hydrodynamics, which allows a simpler derivation of a well known stability criterion for polytropic stellar configurations. Boundary conditions are based entirely on mass conservation. The new approach is tested on isothermal and polytropic atmospheres and then used to initiate a new study of stars. Traditional results for polytropic, spherical configurations are confirmed, but our study gives new insight and new results for the case that radiation is taken into account.
Following the scheme developed by Misner and Sharp, we discuss the dynamics of gravitational collapse. For this purpose, an interior cylindrically symmetric spacetime is matched to an exterior charged static cylindrically symmetric spacetime using the Darmois matching conditions. Dynamical equations are obtained with matter dissipating in the form of shear viscosity. The effect of charge and dissipative quantities over the cylindrical collapse are studied. Finally, we show that homogeneity in energy density and conformal flatness of spacetime are necessary and sufficient for each other.
Based on the geodesic equation in a static spherically symmetric metric we discuss the rotation curve and gravitational lensing. The rotation curve determines one function in the metric without assuming Einstein’s equations. Then lensing is considered in the weak field approximation of general relativity. From the null geodesics we derive the lensing equation. The gravitational potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) which determines the lensing is directly give by the rotation curve <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) = −<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> <sup>2</sup>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>). This allows to test general relativity on the scale of galaxies where dark matter is relevant.
This paper explores a thin shell of ideal fluid surrounding a Kerr black hole assuming a slow rotation and retaining only first order terms of expansion in angular momentum. It is shown that a physically feasible shell rotates rigidly in this approximation and that the interior black hole mass is constrained by other parameters of the system. Furthermore, it is shown that the local inertial frames are “dragged” by the shell as the shell radius approaches the gravitational radius, which is similar to results of studies considering a flat interior.
We present a new class of black hole solutions with a minimally coupled scalar field in the presence of a negative cosmological constant. We consider an one-parameter family of self-interaction potentials parametrized by a dimensionless parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>. When <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> = 0, we recover the conformally invariant solution of the Martinez–Troncoso–Zanelli (MTZ) black hole. A non-vanishing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> signals the departure from conformal invariance. Thermodynamically, there is a critical temperature at vanishing black hole mass, where a higher-order phase transition occurs, as in the case of the MTZ black hole. Additionally, we obtain a branch of hairy solutions which undergo a first-order phase transition at a second critical temperature which depends on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> and it is higher than the MTZ critical temperature. As <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> → 0, this second critical temperature diverges.
Motivated by the recent work of the hidden conformal symmetry of the Kerr black hole, we investigate the hidden conformal symmetry of a Kerr–Sen black hole and a Kerr–Newman–Kasuya black hole. Our result shows the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the periodicity of the azimuthal angle. The absorption across section is in consistence with the finite temperature absorption cross section for a 2D CFT. The entropies of the black holes are reproduced by the Cardy formula.
In order to understand how locally static configurations around gravitationally bound bodies can be embedded in an expanding universe, we investigate the solutions of general relativity describing a space–time whose spatial sections have the topology of a 3-sphere with two identical masses at the poles. We show that Israel junction conditions imply that two spherically symmetric static regions around the masses cannot be glued together. If one is interested in an exterior solution, this prevents the geometry around the masses to be of the Schwarzschild type and leads to the introduction of a cosmological constant. The study of the extension of the Kottler space–time shows that there exists a non-static solution consisting of two static regions surrounding the masses that match a Kantowski–Sachs expanding region on the cosmological horizon. The comparison with a Swiss-Cheese construction is also discussed.
We construct a warm inflation model with inflaton field non-minimally coupled to induced gravity on a warped DGP brane. We incorporate possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane in the spirit of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity. We study cosmological perturbations in this setup. In the case of two field inflation such as warm inflation, usually entropy perturbations are generated. While it is expected that in the case of one field inflation these perturbations to be removed, we show that even in the absence of the radiation field, entropy perturbations are generated in our setup due to non-minimal coupling and modification of the induced gravity. We study the effect of dissipation on the inflation parameters of this extended braneworld scenario.
We study a possibility of anisotropic scale invariant cosmology. It is shown that within the conventional Einstein gravity, the violation of the null energy condition is necessary. We construct an example based on a ghost condensation model that violates the null energy condition. The cosmological solution necessarily contains at least one contracting spatial direction as in the Kasner solution. Our cosmology is conjectured to be dual to, if any, a non-unitary anisotropic scale invariant Euclidean field theory. We investigate simple correlation functions of the dual theory by using the holographic computation. After compactification of the contracting direction, our setup may yield a dual field theory description of the winding tachyon condensation that might solve the singularity of big bang/crunch of the universe.
We report about stability conditions for static, spherically symmetric objects that share the essential features of mass varying neutrinos in cosmological scenarios. Compact structures of particles with variable mass are held together preponderantly by an attractive force mediated by a background scalar field. Their corresponding conditions for equilibrium and stability are given in terms of the ratio between the total mass-energy and the spherical lump radius, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M/R</em>. We show that the mass varying mechanism leading to lump formation can modify the cosmological predictions for the cosmological neutrino mass limits. Our study comprises Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff solutions of relativistic objects with non-uniform energy densities. The results leave open some questions concerning stable regular solutions that, to an external observer, very closely reproduce the preliminary conditions to form Schwarzschild black holes.
We have explored a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 2 higher-dimensional cosmology dominated by phantom energy with a static traversable wormhole dominated by a time-dependent cosmological constant. Some interesting features are revealed and discussed in some details.
Static observers in curved spacetimes may interpret their proper acceleration as the opposite of a local gravitational field (in the Newtonian sense). Based on this interpretation and motivated by the equivalence principle, we are led to investigate congruences of timelike curves in Minkowski spacetime whose acceleration field coincides with the acceleration field of static observers of curved spaces. The congruences give rise to non-inertial frames that are examined. Specifically, we find, based on the locality principle, the embedding of simultaneity hypersurfaces adapted to the non-inertial frame in an explicit form for arbitrary acceleration fields. We also determine, from the Einstein equations, a covariant field equation that regulates the behavior of the proper acceleration of static observers in curved spacetimes. It corresponds to an exact relativistic version of the Newtonian gravitational field equation. In the specific case in which the level surfaces of the norm of the acceleration field of the static observers are maximally symmetric two-dimensional spaces, the energy–momentum tensor of the source is analyzed.

Large gravitational wave interferometric detectors, like Virgo and LIGO, demonstrated the capability to reach their design sensitivity, but to transform these machines into an effective observational instrument for gravitational wave astronomy a large improvement in sensitivity is required. Advanced detectors in the near future and third generation observatories in slightly more than one decade will open the possibility to perform gravitational wave astronomical observations from the Earth. An overview of the technological progress needed to realize a third generation observatory, like the Einstein Telescope (ET), and a possible evolution scenario are discussed in this paper.
The first generation of gravitational wave interferometric detectors have taken data at, or close to, their design sensitivity. This data has been searched for a broad range of gravitational wave signatures. An overview of gravitational wave search methods and results are presented. Searches for gravitational waves from unmodelled burst sources, compact binary coalescences, continuous wave sources and stochastic backgrounds are discussed.
We discuss different ways that neutron stars can generate gravitational waves, describe recent improvements in modelling the relevant scenarios in the context of improving detector sensitivity, and show how observations are beginning to test our understanding of fundamental physics. The main purpose of the discussion is to establish promising science goals for third-generation ground-based detectors, like the Einstein Telescope, and identify the various challenges that need to be met if we want to use gravitational-wave data to probe neutron star physics.
Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to play a crucial role in the development of multimessenger astrophysics. The combination of GW observations with other astrophysical triggers, such as from gamma-ray and X-ray satellites, optical/radio telescopes, and neutrino detectors allows us to decipher science that would otherwise be inaccessible. In this paper, we provide a broad review from the multimessenger perspective of the science reach offered by the third generation interferometric GW detectors and by the Einstein Telescope (ET) in particular. We focus on cosmic transients, and base our estimates on the results obtained by ET’s predecessors GEO, LIGO, and Virgo.
Numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of compact binaries are expected to be an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave astronomy. The sensitivity of future detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will place much higher demands on NR simulations than first- and second-generation ground-based detectors. We discuss the issues facing compact-object simulations over the next decade, with an emphasis on estimating where the accuracy and parameter space coverage will be sufficient for ET and where significant work is needed.
We discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) to enhance our astrophysical knowledge through detections of gravitational waves emitted by binaries including intermediate-mass and massive black holes. The design target for such instruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\sim 1-10}\)</span> Hz range. This will allow the detection of gravitational waves generated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\sim100-10000\,\,M_{\odot}}\)</span> . We primarily discuss two different source types—mergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass, and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\sim1-10\,\,M_{\odot}}\)</span> into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in dark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of very massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar collisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we will discuss both formation channels, and both classes of merger in each case. We review existing rate estimates where these exist in the literature, and provide some new calculations for the approximate numbers of events that will be seen by a detector like the Einstein Telescope. These results indicate that the ET may see a few to a few thousand comparable-mass IMBH mergers and as many as several hundred IMRI events per year. These observations will significantly enhance our understanding of galactic black-hole growth, of the existence and properties of IMBHs and of the astrophysics of globular clusters. We finish our review with a discussion of some more speculative sources of gravitational waves for the ET, including hypermassive white dwarfs and eccentric stellar-mass compact-object binaries.
The Einstein Telescope is a proposed third generation gravitational wave detector that will operate in the region of 1 Hz to a few kHz. As well as the inspiral of compact binaries composed of neutron stars or black holes, the lower frequency cut-off of the detector will open the window to a number of new sources. These will include the end stage of inspirals, plus merger and ringdown of intermediate mass black holes, where the masses of the component bodies are on the order of a few hundred solar masses. There is also the possibility of observing intermediate mass ratio inspirals, where a stellar mass compact object inspirals into a black hole which is a few hundred to a few thousand times more massive. In this article, we investigate some of the data analysis challenges for the Einstein Telescope such as the effects of increased source number, the need for more accurate waveform models and the some of the computational issues that a data analysis strategy might face.
The third generation of gravitational wave observatories, with the aim of providing 100 times better sensitivity than currently operating interferometers, is expected to establish the evolving field of gravitational wave astronomy. A key element, required to achieve this ambitious sensitivity goal, is the exploration of new interferometer geometries, topologies and configurations. In this article we review the current status of the ongoing design work for third-generation gravitational wave observatories. The main focus is the evaluation of the detector geometry and detector topology. In addition we discuss some promising detector configurations and potential noise reduction schemes.
Third generation terrestrial interferometric gravitational wave detectors will likely require significant advances in laser and optical technologies to reduce two of the main limiting noise sources: thermal noise due to mirror coatings and quantum noise arising from a combination of shot noise and radiation pressure noise. Increases in laser power and possible changes of the operational wavelength require new high power laser sources and new electro-optic modulators and Faraday isolators. Squeezed light can be used to further reduce the quantum noise while nano-structured optical components can be used to reduce or eliminate mirror coating thermal noise as well as to implement all-reflective interferometer configurations to avoid thermal effects in mirror substrates. This paper is intended to give an overview on the current state-of-the-art and future trends in these areas of ongoing research and development.
Various noise sources limit the sensitivity of current interferometric gravitational wave detectors, including seismic noise, thermal noise of the optical components and suspension elements and photon shot noise. Plans are in place for a suite of hardware upgrades which should increase the sensitivity of these detectors by reducing the various noise sources. With these designs for 2nd generation detectors mature, techniques for further improvement of detector sensitivity by a factor of approximately 10 are under study. A particular challenge is the reduction of the thermal noise associated with the interferometer mirrors and their suspensions. We review the current status of research on thermal noise in interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Aspects of possible techniques for use in future ‘3rd generation detectors’ such as cryogenics and diffractive optics are discussed.
The next generation gravitational wave interferometric detectors will likely be underground detectors to extend the GW detection frequency band to frequencies below the Newtonian noise limit. Newtonian noise originates from the continuous motion of the Earth’s crust driven by human activity, tidal stresses and seismic motion, and from mass density fluctuations in the atmosphere. It is calculated that on Earth’s surface, on a typical day, it will exceed the expected GW signals at frequencies below 10 Hz. The noise will decrease underground by an unknown amount. It is important to investigate and to quantify this expected reduction and its effect on the sensitivity of future detectors, to plan for further improvement strategies. We report about some of these aspects. Analytical models can be used in the simplest scenarios to get a better qualitative and semi-quantitative understanding. As more complete modeling can be done numerically, we will discuss also some results obtained with a finite-element-based modeling tool. The method is verified by comparing its results with the results of analytic calculations for surface detectors. A key point about noise models is their initial parameters and conditions, which require detailed information about seismic motion in a real scenario. We will describe an effort to characterize the seismic activity at the Homestake mine which is currently in progress. This activity is specifically aimed to provide informations and to explore the site as a possible candidate for an underground observatory. Although the only compelling reason to put the interferometer underground is to reduce the Newtonian noise, we expect that the more stable underground environment will have a more general positive impact on the sensitivity. We will end this report with some considerations about seismic and suspension noise.
The dominant noises which limit the present sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors are the thermal noise of the suspended mirrors and the shot noise. For the third generation of gravitational wave detectors as the Einstein Telescope (ET), the reduction of the shot noise implies to increase the power stored in the detector at 1 MW level and, at the same time, to compensate the huge optic distortion due to induced thermal lensing. At low temperature it is possible to reduce both these effects. However, lowering the temperature of the test masses without injecting vibration noise from the cooling system is a technological challenge. We review here the thermal noise impact on the ultimate ET sensitivity limit and we discuss possible cryogenic configurations to cool the mirror.
Second-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors will be operating at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), a sensitivity limitation set by the trade off between measurement accuracy and quantum back action, which is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We review several schemes that allows the quantum noise of interferometers to surpass the SQL significantly over a broad frequency band. Such schemes may be an important component of the design of third-generation detectors.
Recently Böhmer and Lobo have shown that a metric due to Florides, which has been used as an interior Schwarzschild solution, can be extended to reveal a classical singularity that has the form of a two-sphere. Here the singularity is shown to be a naked scalar curvature singularity that is both timelike and gravitationally weak. It is also shown to be a quantum singularity because the Klein–Gordon operator associated with quantum mechanical particles approaching the singularity is not essentially self-adjoint.
We present a solution to the cosmological constant, the zero-point energy, and the quantum gravity problems within a single comprehensive framework. We show that in quantum theories of gravity in which the zero-point energy density of the gravitational field is well-defined, the cosmological constant and zero-point energy problems solve each other by mutual cancellation between the cosmological constant and the matter and gravitational field zero-point energy densities. Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field zero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace anomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are well-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal invariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based quantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum theory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be ghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any and all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by quantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental classical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical condensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum tensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and zero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large they might be. In our approach quantization of the gravitational field is caused by its coupling to quantized matter fields, with the gravitational field not needing any independent quantization of its own. With there being no a priori classical curvature, one does not have to make it compatible with quantization.
In the Weyl-Dirac (W-D) framework a spatially closed cosmological model is considered. It is assumed that the space-time of the universe has a chaotic Weylian microstructure but is described on a large scale by Riemannian geometry. Locally fields of the Weyl connection vector act as creators of massive bosons having spin 1. It is suggested that these bosons, called weylons, provide most of the dark matter in the universe. At the beginning the universe is a spherically symmetric geometric entity without matter. Primary matter is created by Dirac’s gauge function very close to the beginning. In the early epoch, when the temperature of the universe achieves its maximum, chaotically oriented Weyl vector fields being localized in micro-cells create weylons. In the dust dominated period Dirac’s gauge function is giving rise to dark energy, the latter causing the cosmic acceleration at present. This oscillatory universe has an initial radius identical to the Plank length = 1.616 exp (−33) cm, at present the cosmic scale factor is 3.21 exp (28) cm, while its maximum value is 8.54 exp (28) cm. All forms of matter are created by geometrically based functions of the W-D theory.
Wilson observables for 2 + 1 quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant, when the spatial manifold is a torus, exhibit several novel features: signed area phases relate the observables assigned to homotopic loops, and their commutators describe loop intersections, with properties that are not yet fully understood. We describe progress in our study of this bracket, which can be interpreted as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>-deformed Goldman bracket, and provide a geometrical interpretation in terms of a quantum version of Pick’s formula for the area of a polygon with integer vertices.
We investigate the meaning of the entropy carried away by Hawking radiations from a black hole. We propose that the entropy for a black hole measures the uncertainty of the information about the black hole forming matter’s precollapsed configurations, self-collapsed configurations, and inter-collapsed configurations. We find that gravitational wave or gravitational radiation alone cannot carry all information about the processes of black hole coalescence and collapse, while the total information locked in the hole could be carried away completely by Hawking radiation as tunneling.
Using the extended forms of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) from string theory and the non-commutative geometries, we derive the Hawking temperature of the Taub-Nut-(A)dS black hole. We show that the generalized versions of the HUP increase the Hawking temperature as in the case of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS black hole.
We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to investigate a global constraints on the modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) model as the unification of dark matter and dark energy from the latest observational data: the Union2 dataset of type supernovae Ia (SNIa), the observational Hubble data (OHD), the cluster X-ray gas mass fraction, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In a flat universe, the constraint results for MCG model are, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Omega_{b}h^{2}\,{=}\,0.02263^{+0.00184}_{-0.00162} (1\sigma)^{+0.00213}_{-0.00195} (2\sigma)}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({B_{s}\,{=}\,0.7788^{+0.0736}_{-0.0723}(1\sigma)^{+0.0918}_{-0.0904} (2\sigma)}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\alpha\,{=}\,0.1079^{+0.3397}_{-0.2539} (1\sigma)^{+0.4678}_{-0.2911} (2\sigma)}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({B\,{=}\,0.00189^{+0.00583}_{-0.00756}(1\sigma)^{+0.00660}_{-0.00915} (2\sigma)}\)</span>, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({H_{0}=70.711^{+4.188}_{-3.142} (1\sigma)^{+5.281}_{-4.149}(2\sigma)}\)</span>.
We construct a gedanken experiment, in which a weak wave packet of the complex massive scalar field interacts with a four-parameter (mass, angular momentum, electric and magnetic charges) Kerr–Newman black hole. We show that this interaction cannot convert an extreme the black hole into a naked sigularity for any black hole parameters and any generic wave packet configuration. The analysis therefore provides support for the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.
We follow the approach of induced-matter theory for a five-dimensional (5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>) vacuum Brans–Dicke theory and introduce induced-matter and induced potential in four dimensional (4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>) hypersurfaces, and then employ a generalized FRW type solution. We confine ourselves to the scalar field and scale factors be functions of the cosmic time. This makes the induced potential, by its definition, vanishes, but the model is capable to expose variety of states for the universe. In general situations, in which the scale factor of the fifth dimension and scalar field are not constants, the 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> equations, for any kind of geometry, admit a power–law relation between the scalar field and scale factor of the fifth dimension. Hence, the procedure exhibits that 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum FRW-like equations are equivalent, in general, to the corresponding 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum ones with the same spatial scale factor but a new scalar field and a new coupling constant, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\tilde{\omega}}\)</span> . We show that the 5<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum FRW-like equations, or its equivalent 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum ones, admit accelerated solutions. For a constant scalar field, the equations reduce to the usual FRW equations with a typical radiation dominated universe. For this situation, we obtain dynamics of scale factors of the ordinary and extra dimensions for any kind of geometry without any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">priori</em> assumption among them. For non-constant scalar fields and spatially flat geometries, solutions are found to be in the form of power–law and exponential ones. We also employ the weak energy condition for the induced-matter, that gives two constraints with negative or positive pressures. All types of solutions fulfill the weak energy condition in different ranges. The power–law solutions with either negative or positive pressures admit both decelerating and accelerating ones. Some solutions accept a shrinking extra dimension. By considering non-ghost scalar fields and appealing the recent observational measurements, the solutions are more restricted. We illustrate that the accelerating power–law solutions, which satisfy the weak energy condition and have non-ghost scalar fields, are compatible with the recent observations in ranges −4/3 &lt; <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> ≤ −1.3151 for the coupling constant and 1.5208 ≤ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &lt; 1.9583 for dependence of the fifth dimension scale factor with the usual scale factor. These ranges also fulfill the condition <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\tilde{\omega} &gt; -3/2}\)</span> which prevents ghost scalar fields in the equivalent 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> vacuum Brans–Dicke equations. The results are presented in a few tables and figures.
Both particle physics and the 1890s Seeliger–Neumann modification of Newtonian gravity suggest considering a “mass term” for gravity, yielding a finite range due to an exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Unlike Nordström’s “massless” theory, massive scalar gravities are strictly Special Relativistic, being invariant under the Poincaré group but not the conformal group. Geometry is a poor guide to understanding massive scalar gravities: matter sees a conformally flat metric, but gravity also sees the rest of the flat metric, barely, in the mass term. Infinitely many theories exhibit this bimetric ‘geometry,’ all with the total stress–energy’s trace as source. All are new except the Freund–Nambu theory. The smooth massless limit indicates underdetermination of theories by data between massless and massive scalar gravities. The ease of accommodating electrons, protons and other fermions using density-weighted Ogievetsky–Polubarinov spinors in scalar gravity is noted.

This is a reprinting of a paper by Roger Penrose, first published in a volume of conference proceedings in 1964, no longer easily accessible, in which he first presented the now-standard description of asymptotically flat spacetimes with the help of a conformal mapping, now called a Penrose transform. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Helmut Friedrich.




We study corrections to the entropy of Einstein–Maxwell dilaton–axion black holes beyond semiclassical approximations. We consider the entropy of the black hole as a state variable and derive these corrections using the exactness criteria of the first law of thermodynamics. We note that from this general frame-work the entropy corrections for “simpler” black holes like Schwarzschild, Reissner–Nordström and anti-de Sitter–Schwarzschild black holes follow easily. This procedure gives us the modified area law as well.
In this paper we study the effect of the anisotropic stress generated by neutrinos on the propagation of primordial cosmological gravitational waves. The presence of anisotropic stress, like the one generated by free-streaming neutrinos, partially absorbs the gravitational waves (GWs) propagating across the Universe. We find that in the standard case of three neutrino families, 22% of the intensity of the wave is absorbed, in fair agreement with previous studies. We have also calculated the maximum possible amount of damping, corresponding to the case of a flat Universe completely dominated by ultrarelativistic collisionless particles. In this case 43% of the intensity of the wave is absorbed. Finally, we have taken into account the effect of collisions, using a simple form for the collision term parameterized by the mean time between interactions, that allows to go smoothly from the case of a tightly coupled fluid to that of a collisionless gas. The dependence of the absorption on the neutrino energy density and on the effectiveness of the interactions opens the interesting possibility of observing spectral features related to particular events in the thermal history of the Universe, like neutrino decoupling and electron–positron annihilation, both occurring at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> ~ 1  MeV. GWS entering the horizon at that time will have today a frequency <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em> ~ 10<sup>−9</sup> Hz, a region that is going to be probed by Pulsar Timing Arrays.
The deviation of the path of a spinning particle from a circular geodesic in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by an extension of the idea of geodesic deviation. Within the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon model and assuming the spin parameter to be sufficiently small so that it makes sense to linearize the equations of motion in the spin variables as well as in the geodesic deviation, the spin–curvature force adds an additional driving term to the second order system of linear ordinary differential equations satisfied by nearby geodesics. Choosing initial conditions for geodesic motion leads to solutions for which the deviations are entirely due to the spin–curvature force, and one finds that the spinning particle position for a given fixed total spin oscillates roughly within an ellipse in the plane perpendicular to the motion, while the azimuthal motion undergoes similar oscillations plus an additional secular drift which varies with spin orientation.
The measurement of relativistic effects around the galactic center may allow in the near future to strongly constrain the parameters of the supermassive black hole likely present at the galactic center (Sgr A*). As a by-product of these measurements it would be possible to severely constrain, in addition, also the parameters of the mass-density distributions of both the innermost star cluster and the dark matter clump around the galactic center.
Driven entirely by human curiosity, the effect of the gravitational bending of light has evolved on unforeseen paths, in an interplay between shifts in prevailing paradigms and advance of technology, into the most unusual way to study planet populations. The confirmation of the bending angle predicted by Einstein with the Solar Eclipse measurements from 1919 marked the breakthrough of the theory of General Relativity, but it was not before the detection of the double image of the quasar 0957+561 that ‘gravitational lensing’ really entered the observational era. The observation of a characteristic transient brightening of a star caused by the gravitational deflection of its light by an intervening foreground star, constituting a ‘microlensing event’, required even further advance in technology before it could first emerge in 1993. While it required more patience in waiting before ‘Einstein’s blip’ for the first time revealed the presence of a planet orbiting a star other than the Sun, such detections can now be monitored live, and gravitational microlensing is not only sensitive to masses as low as that of the Moon, but can even reveal planets around stars in galaxies other than the Milky Way.
The relation between the mass of supermassive black holes located in the center of the host galaxies and the kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding bulges can be reinterpreted as an age–temperature diagram for galaxies. This relation fits the experimental data better than the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>•</sub>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>G</sub>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>•</sub>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> <sub>G</sub>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>•</sub>−<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em> laws. The validity of this statement has been confirmed by using three samples extracted from different catalogues of galaxies. In the framework of the ΛCDM cosmology our relation has been compared with the predictions of two galaxy formation models based on the Millennium Simulation.
We extend the work of Thirukkanesh and Maharaj (Class Quantum Gravity 25:235001, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2007</a></span>) by considering quadratic equation of state for the matter distribution to study the general situation of a compact relativistic body. Presence of electromagnetic field and anisotropy in the pressure are also assumed. Some new classes of static spherically symmetrical models of relativistic stars are obtained. All the results given in Thirukkanesh and Maharaj (Class Quantum Gravity 25:235001, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2007</a></span>) and there in can also be recovered as a particular case of our work.
Using Lie approximate symmetry methods for differential equations second-order approximate symmetries of the geodesic equations for the Kerr–Newman-AdS (KN-AdS) spacetime are investigated. For this purpose the KN-AdS metric is considered as a second perturbation of the AdS metric. A rescaling of the arc length parameter for consistency of the trivial second-order approximate symmetries of the geodesic equations indicates that the energy in the KN-AdS spacetime has to be rescaled. There is an extra contribution to the energy of the KN-AdS spacetime due to the cosmological constant. This energy expression is compared with that for the Kerr–Newman (KN) spacetime.
Several exoplanets have been detected towards the Galactic bulge with the microlensing technique. We show that exoplanets in M31 may also be detected with the pixel-lensing method, if telescopes making high cadence observations of an ongoing microlensing event are used. Using a Monte Carlo approach we find that the mean mass for detectable planetary systems is about 2 <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>J</sub>. However, even small mass exoplanets (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({M_{\rm P} &lt; 20 M_{\oplus}}\)</span>) can cause significant deviations, which are observable with large telescopes. We reanalysed the POINT-AGAPE microlensing event PA-99-N2. First, we test the robustness of the binary lens conclusion for this light curve. Second, we show that for such long duration and bright microlensing events, the efficiency for finding planetary-like deviations is strongly enhanced with respect to that evaluated for all planetary detectable events.
In this paper, we have studied the accretion of phantom energy on a (2 + 1)-dimensional stationary Banados–Teitelboim–Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. It has already been shown by Babichev et al. that for the accretion of phantom energy onto a Schwarzschild black hole, the mass of black hole would decrease and the rate of change of mass would be dependent on the mass of the black hole. However, in the case of (2 + 1)-dimensional BTZ black hole, the mass evolution due to phantom accretion is independent of the mass of the black hole and is dependent only on the pressure and density of the phantom energy. We also study the generalized second law of thermodynamics at the event horizon and construct a condition that puts an lower bound on the pressure of the phantom energy.
We investigate the effects of accretion of phantom energy onto primordial black holes. Since Hawking radiation and phantom energy accretion contribute to a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">decrease</em> of the mass of the black hole, the primordial black hole that would be expected to decay now due to the Hawking process would decay <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">earlier</em> due to the inclusion of the phantom energy. Equivalently, to have the primordial black hole decay now it would have to be more massive initially. We find that the effect of the phantom energy is substantial and the black holes decaying now would be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">much</em> more massive—over ten orders of magnitude! This effect will be relevant for determining the time of production and hence the number of evaporating black holes expected in a universe accelerating due to phantom energy.
The nature of the dark energy is still a mystery and several models have been proposed to explain it. Here we consider a phenomenological model for dark energy decay into photons and particles as proposed by Lima (Phys Rev D 54:2571, 1996). He studied the thermodynamic aspects of decaying dark energy models in particular in the case of a continuous photon creation and/or disruption. Following his approach, we derive a temperature redshift relation for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which depends on the effective equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> and on the “adiabatic index” <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>. Comparing our relation with the data on the CMB temperature as a function of the redshift obtained from Sunyaev–Zel’dovich observations and at higher redshift from quasar absorption line spectra, we find <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> = −0.97 ± 0.03, adopting for the adiabatic index <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> = 4/3, in good agreement with current estimates and still compatible with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub>eff</sub> = −1, implying that the dark energy content being constant in time.
We study the Ricci dark energy model (RDE) which was introduced as an alternative to the holographic dark energy model. We point out that an accelerating phase of the RDE is that of a constant dark energy model. This implies that the RDE is not a new model of explaining the present accelerating universe.
A class of static, vacuum solutions of (free-electromagnetic) Kaluza-Klein equations with three-dimensional spherical symmetry is studied. In order to explore the dynamic in such spacetimes, geodesic equations are obtained and the effective potential for massive test particles is analyzed. Particular attention is devoted to the properties of the four-dimensional counterpart of these solutions in their Schwarzschild limit. A modification of the circular stable orbits compared with the Schwarzschild case is investigated.
We present a discussion of two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) configurations, concerning the equilibria of accretion disks of a strongly magnetized astrophysical object. We set up a viscoresistive scenario which generalizes previous two-dimensional analyses by reconciling the ideal MHD coupling of the vertical and the radial equilibria within the disk with the standard mechanism of the angular momentum transport, relying on dissipative properties of the plasma configuration. The linear features of the considered model are analytically developed and the non-linear configuration problem is addressed, by fixing the entire disk profile at the same order of approximation. Indeed, the azimuthal and electron force balance equations are no longer automatically satisfied when poloidal currents and matter fluxes are included in the problem. These additional components of the equilibrium configuration induce a different morphology of the magnetic flux surface, with respect to the ideal and simply rotating disk.
We present the Ernst potential and the line element of an exact solution of Einstein’s vacuum field equations that contains as arbitrary parameters the total mass, the angular momentum, and the quadrupole moment of a rotating mass distribution. We show that in the limiting case of slowly rotating and slightly deformed configuration, there exists a coordinate transformation that relates the exact solution with the approximate Hartle solution. It is shown that this approximate solution can be smoothly matched with an interior perfect fluid solution with physically reasonable properties. This opens the possibility of considering the quadrupole moment as an additional physical degree of freedom that could be used to search for a realistic exact solution, representing both the interior and exterior gravitational field generated by a self-gravitating axisymmetric distribution of mass of perfect fluid in stationary rotation.
Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we investigate the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold for diverse thermodynamic systems. Starting from Legendre invariant metrics of the phase manifold, we derive thermodynamic metrics for the equilibrium manifold whose curvature becomes singular at those points where phase transitions of first and second order occur. We conclude that the thermodynamic curvature of the equilibrium manifold, as defined in geometrothermodynamics, can be used as a measure of thermodynamic interaction in diverse systems with two and three thermodynamic degrees of freedom.
In this paper we present non-singular coordinates for the rotating BTZ (Banados–Teitelboim–Zanelli) black hole. The approach is further extended to construct non-singular coordinates for different cases of general circularly symmetric black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions.
We investigate the expanding and collapsing regions by taking two well-known spherically symmetric spacetimes. For this purpose, the general formalism is developed by using Israel junction conditions for arbitrary spacetimes. This has been used to obtain the surface energy density and the tangential pressure. The minimal pressure provides the gateway to explore the expanding and collapsing regions. We take Minkowski and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes and use the general formulation to investigate the expanding and collapsing regions of the shell.

We discuss universal properties of axisymmetric and stationary configurations consisting of a central black hole and surrounding matter in Einstein–Maxwell theory. In particular, we find that certain physical equations and inequalities (involving angular momentum, electric charge and horizon area) are not restricted to the Kerr–Newman solution but can be generalized to the situation where the black hole is distorted by an arbitrary axisymmetric and stationary surrounding matter distribution.
I consider techniques for Berger–Oliger adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) when numerically solving partial differential equations with wave-like solutions, using characteristic (double-null) grids. Such AMR algorithms are naturally recursive, and the best-known past Berger–Oliger characteristic AMR algorithm, that of Pretorius and Lehner (J Comp Phys 198:10, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR69">2004</a></span>), recurses on individual “diamond” characteristic grid cells. This leads to the use of fine-grained memory management, with individual grid cells kept in two-dimensional linked lists at each refinement level. This complicates the implementation and adds overhead in both space and time. Here I describe a Berger–Oliger characteristic AMR algorithm which instead recurses on null <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">slices</em>. This algorithm is very similar to the usual Cauchy Berger–Oliger algorithm, and uses relatively coarse-grained memory management, allowing entire null slices to be stored in contiguous arrays in memory. The algorithm is very efficient in both space and time. I describe discretizations yielding both second and fourth order global accuracy. My code implementing the algorithm described here is included in the electronic supplementary materials accompanying this paper, and is freely available to other researchers under the terms of the GNU general public license.
The thick brane model supported by a nonlinear spinor field is constructed. The different cases with the various values of the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Lambda \left( \begin{array}{l} &lt; \\ =\\ &gt; \end{array} \right) 0}\)</span> are investigated. It is shown that regular analytical spinor thick brane solutions with asymptotically Minkowski (at Λ = 0) or anti-de Sitter spacetimes (at Λ &lt;  0) do exist.
We study expectation values of observables in three-dimensional spinfoam quantum gravity coupled to Dirac fermions. We revisit the model introduced by one of the authors and extend it to the case of massless fermionic fields. We introduce observables, analyse their symmetries and the corresponding proper gauge fixing. The Berezin integral over the fermionic fields is performed and the fermionic observables are expanded in open paths and closed loops associated to pure quantum gravity observables. We obtain the vertex amplitudes for gauge-invariant observables, while the expectation values of gauge-variant observables, such as the fermion propagator, are given by the evaluation of particular spin networks.
The covariant generalizations of the background dark sector coupling suggested in Mangano, Miele and Pettorino (Mod Phys Lett A 18:831, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22">2003</a></span>) are considered. The evolution of perturbations is studied with detailed attention to interaction rate that is proportional to the product of dark matter and dark energy densities. It is shown that some classes of models with coupling of this type do not suffer from early time instabilities in strong coupling regime.
We continue our investigation of massive gravity in the massless limit of vanishing graviton mass. From gauge invariance we derive the most general coupling between scalar matter and gravity. We get further couplings beside the standard coupling to the energy–momentum tensor. On the classical level this leads to a further modification of general relativity.
The work deals with the thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon. The matter in the universe has three constituents namely dark energy, dark matter and radiation in nature and interaction between then is assumed. The variation of entropy of the surface of the horizon is obtained from unified first law while matter entropy variation is calculated from the Gibbss’ law. Finally, validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics is examined and conclusions are written point wise.
We propose the method of investigation of radial motions for charged and neutral test particles in the Reissner–Nordström field by means of mass potential. In this context we analyze special features of interaction of charges and their motions in General Relativity and construct the radial motion classification. For test particles and a central source with charges <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>, respectively, the conditions of attraction (when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">qQ</em> &gt; 0) and repulsion (when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">qQ</em> &lt; 0) are obtained. The conditions of motionless test particle states with respect to the central source are investigated and, in addition, stability conditions for such static equilibrium states are found. It is shown that stable states are possible only for the bound states of weakly charged particles in the field of a naked singularity. Frequencies of small oscillations of test particles near their equilibrium positions are also found.
We prove that some basic aspects of gravity commonly attributed to the modern connection-based approaches, can be reached naturally within the usual Riemannian geometry-based approach, by assuming the independence between the metric and the connection of the background manifold. These aspects are: 1) the BF-like field theory structure of the Einstein–Hilbert action, of the cosmological term, and of the corresponding equations of motion; 2) the formulation of Maxwellian field theories using only the Riemannian connection and its corresponding curvature tensor, and the subsequent unification of gravity and gauge interactions in a four dimensional field theory; 3) the construction of four and three dimensional geometrical invariants in terms of the Riemann tensor and its traces, particularly the formulation of an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">anomalous</em> Chern–Simons topological model where the action of diffeomorphisms is identified with the action of a gauge symmetry, close to Witten’s formulation of three-dimensional gravity as a Chern–Simon gauge theory. 4) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Tordions</em> as propagating and non-propagating fields are also formulated in this approach. This new formulation collapses to the usual one when the metric connection is invoked, and certain geometrical structures very known in the traditional literature can be identified as remanent structures in this collapse.
We generalize Penrose’s notion of conformal infinity of spacetime, to situations with anisotropic scaling. This is relevant not only for Lifshitz-type anisotropic gravity models, but also in standard general relativity and string theory, for spacetimes exhibiting a natural <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">asymptotic</em> anisotropy. Examples include the Lifshitz and Schrödinger spaces (proposed as AdS/CFT duals of nonrelativistic field theories), warped <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">AdS</em> <sub>3</sub>, and the near-horizon extreme Kerr geometry. The anisotropic conformal boundary appears crucial for resolving puzzles of holographic renormalization in such spacetimes.
In this paper, we study the motion of photons around a Kehagias–Sfetsos (KS) black hole and obtain constraints on IR modified Hořava gravity without cosmological constant (~Λ<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">W</em> </sub>). An analytic formula for the light deflection angle is obtained. For a propagating photon, the deflection angle <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δφ</em> increases with large values of the Hořava gravity parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em>. Under the UV limit <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\omega \longrightarrow \infty}\)</span>, deflection angle reduces to the result of usual Schwarzschild case, 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GM</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. It is also found that with increasing scale of astronomical observation system the Hořava–Lifshitz gravity should satisfy |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sup>2</sup>| &gt; 1.1725 × 10<sup>−16</sup> with 12% precision for Earth system, |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sup>2</sup>| &gt; 8.27649 × 10<sup>−17</sup> with 17% precision for Jupiter system and |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sup>2</sup>| &gt; 8.27650 × 10<sup>−15</sup> with 0.17% precision for solar system.
It is shown that the vacuum state in the presence of Lorentz violation can be followed by a universe filled with particles at late times similar to the current status of the universe. In this model a modification in dispersion relation (Lorentz violation) appears representing the regime of quantum gravity which has been dominant in the early universe. The existence of the particles can be interpreted as an evidence for quantum effects of gravity at early times. It is concluded that the present observable particles have a geometrical origin due to the well-known correspondence between geometry and gravity.
We consider a spatially homogeneous and totally anisotropic Bianchi-I space-time with perfect fluid (dark matter and standard visible matter) and anisotropic dark energy, which has dynamical energy density. The two sources are assumed to interact minimally and therefore their energy momentum tensors are conserved separately. Using suitable physical assumptions, the field equations are solved exactly. Various dark energy models are studied and it is found that quintessence model is suitable for describing the present evolution of the universe. The geometrical and kinematical features of the models and the behavior of the anisotropy of the dark energy, are examined in detail.
A general black-branes system under the T-duality transformation could produce a smeared system with different dimensional black branes. We first use some simple examples to see that both systems have the same entropy and then present a rigorous method to prove this general property. Using the property we could easily know the entropy of some complex black-brane systems.
A new model is proposed to a collapsing star consisting of an initial inhomogeneous energy density and anisotropic pressure fluid with shear, radial heat flow and outgoing radiation. In previous papers one of us has always assumed an initial star with homogeneous energy density. The aim of this work is to generalize the previous models by introducing an initial inhomogeneous energy density and compare it to the initial homogeneous energy density collapse model. We will show the differences between these models in the evolution of all physical quantities that characterizes the gravitational collapse. The behavior of the energy density, pressure, mass, luminosity and the effective adiabatic index is analyzed. The pressure of the star, at the beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but due to the presence of the shear the pressure becomes more and more anisotropic. The black hole is never formed because the apparent horizon formation condition is never satisfied, in contrast of the previous model where a black hole is formed. An observer at infinity sees a radial point source radiating exponentially until reaches the time of maximum luminosity and suddenly the star turns off. In contrast of the former model where the luminosity also increases exponentially, reaching a maximum and after it decreases until the formation of the black hole. The effective adiabatic index is always positive without any discontinuity in contrast of the former model where there is a discontinuity around the time of maximum luminosity. The collapse is about three thousand times slower than in the case where the energy density is initially homogeneous.
Solutions to Einstein’s field equations describing rotating fluid bodies in equilibrium permit parametric (i.e. quasi-stationary) transitions to the extreme Kerr solution (outside the horizon). This has been shown analytically for discs of dust and numerically for ring solutions with various equations of state. From the exterior point of view, this transition can be interpreted as a (quasi) black hole limit. All gravitational multipole moments assume precisely the values of an extremal Kerr black hole in the limit. In the present paper, the way in which the black hole limit is approached is investigated in more detail by means of a parametric Taylor series expansion of the exact solution describing a rigidly rotating disc of dust. Combined with numerical calculations for ring solutions our results indicate an interesting universal behaviour of the multipole moments near the black hole limit.
We consider Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond gravity-matter system in bulk space-time interacting self-consistently with two (widely separated) codimension-one electrically charged <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">lightlike</em> branes. The lightlike brane dynamics is explicitly given by manifestly reparametrization invariant world-volume actions in two equivalent dual to each other formulations (Polyakov-type and Nambu-Goto-type ones) proposed in our previous work. We find an explicit solution of the pertinent Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond-lightlike-brane equations of motion describing a “two-throat” wormhole-like space-time consisting of a “left” compactified Bertotti-Robinson universe connected to a “middle” non-compact Reissner-Nordström- de-Sitter space-time region, which in turn is connected to another “right” compactified Bertotti-Robinson universe. Each of the lightlike branes automatically occupies one of the “throats”, so that they dynamically induce a sequence of spontaneous space-time compactification/decompactification transitions.
We are interested on studying various inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters in the context of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Randall-Sandrum</em> type 2 Braneworld model. We consider in particular three types of potentials. We apply the slow-roll approximation in the high energy limit to constraint the parameter potentials by confronting our results to recent WMAP7 observations. We show that, for some values of the e-folding number <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>, the monomial potential provides the best fit results to observations data.
With toy modelling of conceptual aspects of quantum cosmology and the problem of time in quantum gravity in mind, I study the classical and quantum dynamics of the pure-shape (i.e. scale-free) triangle formed by 3 particles in 2-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. I do so by importing techniques to the triangle model from the corresponding 4 particles in 1-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> model, using the fact that both have 2-spheres for shape spaces, though the latter has a trivial realization whilst the former has a more involved Hopf (or Dragt) type realization. I furthermore interpret the ensuing Dragt-type coordinates as shape quantities: a measure of anisoscelesness, the ellipticity of the base and apex’s moments of inertia, and a quantity proportional to the area of the triangle. I promote these quantities at the quantum level to operators whose expectation and spread are then useful in understanding the quantum states of the system. Additionally, I tessellate the 2-sphere by its physical interpretation as the shape space of triangles, and then use this as a back-cloth from which to read off the interpretation of dynamical trajectories, potentials and wavefunctions. I include applications to timeless approaches to the problem of time and to the role of uniform states in quantum cosmological modelling.
The Lanczos-Lovelock models of gravity constitute the most general theories of gravity in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensions which satisfy (a) the principle of of equivalence, (b) the principle of general covariance, and (c) have field equations involving derivatives of the metric tensor only up to second order. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>th order Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangian is a polynomial of degree <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> in the curvature tensor. The field equations resulting from it become trivial in the critical dimension <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and the action itself can be written as the integral of an exterior derivative of an expression involving the vierbeins, in the differential form language. While these results are well known, there is some controversy in the literature as to whether the Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangian itself can be expressed as a total divergence of quantities built only from the metric and its derivatives (without using the vierbeins) in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. We settle this issue by showing that this is indeed possible and provide an algorithm for its construction. In particular, we demonstrate that, in two dimensions, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({R \sqrt{-g} = \partial_j R^j}\)</span> for a doublet of functions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup> = (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>0</sup>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>1</sup>) which depends only on the metric and its first derivatives. We explicitly construct families of such <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">j</em> </sup>-s in two dimensions. We also address related questions regarding the Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 4. Finally, we demonstrate the relation between the Chern-Simons form and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>th order Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangian.
Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity coupled to a dynamical dilaton is examined from the viewpoint of Einstein’s equivalence principle. We point out that the usual frame change that applies to the action without curvature correction does not cure the problem of nonminimal couplings by the dynamical nature of a dilaton field. Thus a modification of the Einstein frame is required. It is proposed that the kinetic term of a dilaton should be brought to a canonical form, which completely fixes the additional terms associated with the frame transformation.
In this study, quark and strange quark matter which exist in the first seconds of the early Universe have been studied in the context of general relativity to be able to obtain space–time geometry of first seconds of the early Universe. For this purpose, Einstein’s field equations for quark and strange quark matter in the non static spherically symmetric space–time have been solved by using experimental result that anisotropy parameter of quark matter is very small. We have concluded from obtained solutions that the space–time structure of first seconds of the Early Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. Also we have concluded that the color interactions of the quarks may be origin of primordial magnetic field in the early universe.
The general extreme limit of the double–Reissner–Nordström solution is worked out in explicit analytical form involving prolate spheroidal coordinates. We name it <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the combined Majumdar–Papapetrou–Bonnor field</em> to underline the fact that it contains as particular cases the two–body specialization of the well–known Majumdar–Papapetrou solution and Bonnor’s three–parameter electrostatic field. To the latter we give a precise physical interpretation as describing a pair of non–rotating extremal black holes with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unequal</em> masses and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unequal</em> opposite charges kept apart by a strut, the absolute values of charges <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exceeding</em> the respective (positive) values of masses.
We consider the ELKO field in interaction through contorsion with its own spin density, and we investigate the form of the consequent autointeractions; to do so we take into account the high-density limit and find plane wave solutions: such plane waves give rise to contorsional autointeractions for which the Ricci metric curvature vanishes and therefore the energy density is equal to zero identically. Consequences are discussed.
We prove a removable-singularity theorem for stationary Einstein equations, with implications for constructions of stationary solutions using soliton methods.

We study the Lie algebras of the covariant representations transforming the matter fields under the de Sitter isometries. We point out that the Casimir operators of these representations can be written in closed forms and we deduce how their eigenvalues depend on the field’s rest energy and spin. For the scalar, vector and Dirac fields, which have well-defined field equations, we express these eigenvalues in terms of mass and spin obtaining thus the principal invariants of the theory of free fields on the de Sitter spacetime. We show that in the flat limit we recover the corresponding invariants of the Wigner irreducible representations of the Poincaré group.
In this paper we consider FRW cosmology in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({F(R,\phi)}\)</span> gravity. It is shown that in particular cases the bouncing behavior may appears in the model whereas the equation of state (EoS) parameter may crosses the phantom divider. For the dynamical universe, quantitatively we also find parameters in the model which satisfies two independent tests:the model independent Cosmological Redshift Drift (CRD) test and the type Ia supernova luminosity distances.
In the context of the so-called Gauss–Bonnet gravity, where the gravitational action includes function of the Gauss–Bonnet invariant, we study cosmological solutions, especially the well-known <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em>CDM model. It is shown that the dark energy contribution and even the inflationary epoch can be explained in the frame of this kind of theories with no need of any other kind of component. Other cosmological solutions are constructed and the rich properties that this kind of theories provide are explored.
We study shear-free spherically symmetric relativistic models with heat flow. Our analysis is based on Lie’s theory of extended groups applied to the governing field equations. In particular, we generate a five-parameter family of transformations which enables us to map existing solutions to new solutions. All known solutions of Einstein equations with heat flow can therefore produce infinite families of new solutions. In addition, we provide two new classes of solutions utilising the Lie infinitesimal generators. These solutions generate an infinite class of solutions given any one of the two unknown metric functions.
The strategy followed so far in the performed or proposed tests of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the Earth with laser-ranged satellites of LAGEOS type relies upon the cancelation of the disturbing huge precessions induced by the first even zonal harmonic coefficient <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>2</sub> of the multipolar expansion of the Newtonian part of the terrestrial gravitational potential by means of suitably designed linear combinations of the nodes Ω of more than one spacecraft. Actually, such a removal does depend on the accuracy with which the coefficients of the combinations adopted can be realistically known. Uncertainties of the order of 2 cm in the semimajor axes <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> and 0.5 milliarcseconds in the inclinations <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, entering the expression of the coefficient <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sub>1</sub> of the combination of their nodes used so far, yield an uncertainty <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δc</em> <sub>1</sub> = 1.30 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. It gives an imperfectly canceled <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>2</sub> signal of 10.8 milliarcseconds per year corresponding to 23% of the Lense-Thirring signature. Uncertainties of the order of 10–30 microarcseconds in the inclinations yield <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δc</em> <sub>1</sub> = 7.9 × 10<sup>−9</sup> which corresponds to an uncanceled <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>2</sub> signature of 6.5 milliarcseconds per year, i.e. 14% of the Lense-Thirring signal. Concerning a future LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES combination with coefficients <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> <sub>1</sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> <sub>2</sub>, the same uncertainties in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> and the less accurate uncertainties in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> as before yield <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δk</em> <sub>1</sub> = 1.1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δk</em> <sub>2</sub> = 2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>; they imply a residual <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>2</sub> combined precession of 14.7 milliarcseconds per year corresponding to 29% of the Lense-Thirring trend. Uncertainties in the inclinations at ≈ 10 microarcseconds level give <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δk</em> <sub>1</sub> = 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δk</em> <sub>2</sub> = 2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>; the uncanceled <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> <sub>2</sub> effect is 7.9 milliarcseconds per year, i.e. 16% of the relativistic effect.
We compute the time delay of strong lensing in the framework of the Einstein-Straus solution in presence of a cosmological constant and restrict ourselves to the case of a spatially flat universe. The calculations are done to first order in the ratio of Schwarzschild radius to peri-lens. We apply our results to the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112. Our predictions for the time delay between the images C and D of the quasar range from 6 to 13 years and are compatible with the experimental lower bound.
According to theoretical physics the cosmological constant (CC) is expected to be much larger in magnitude than other energy densities in the universe, which is in stark contrast to the observed Big Bang evolution. We address this old CC problem not by introducing an extremely fine-tuned counterterm, but in the context of modified gravity in the Palatini formalism. In our model the large CC term is filtered out, and it does not prevent a standard cosmological evolution. We discuss the filter effect in the epochs of radiation and matter domination as well as in the asymptotic de Sitter future. The final expansion rate can be much lower than inferred from the large CC without using a fine-tuned counterterm. Finally, we show that the CC filter works also in the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) metric describing a black hole environment with a CC compatible to the future de Sitter cosmos.
By considering the logarithmic correction to the energy density, we study the behavior of Hubble parameter in the holographic dark energy model. We assume that the universe is dominated by interacting dark energy and matter and the accelerated expansion of the universe, which may be occurred in the early universe or late time, is studied.
We investigate the physics of an exact static solution representing a mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> and a charged mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>. We find that the electric field has a neutral point, and we ascribe this to the effect of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pseudocharge</em> induced on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>. The induced field is local in that it does not have inverse square strength at infinity.
A new classical theory of gravitation within the framework of general relativity is presented. It is based on a matrix formulation of four-dimensional <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Riemann</span>-spaces and uses no artificial fields or adjustable parameters. The geometrical stress-energy tensor is derived from a matrix-trace <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Lagrangian</span>, which is not equivalent to the curvature scalar <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. To enable a direct comparison with the <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Einstein</span>-theory a tetrad formalism is utilized, which shows similarities to teleparallel gravitation theories, but uses complex tetrads. Matrix theory might solve a 27-year-old, fundamental problem of those theories (Sect. 4.1). For the standard test cases (PPN scheme, <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Schwarz</span> <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">schild</span>-solution) no differences to the <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Einstein</span>-theory are found. However, the matrix theory exhibits novel, interesting vacuum solutions.
Here we consider our universe as inhomogeneous spherically symmetric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lema</em> <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\hat{i}}\)</span> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tre−Tolman−Bondi Model</em> and analyze the thermodynamics of this model of the universe. The trapping horizon is calculated and is found to coincide with the apparent horizon. The Einstein field equations are shown to be equivalent with the unified first law of thermodynamics. Finally assuming the first law of thermodynamics validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics is examined at the apparent horizon for the perfect fluid and at the event horizon for holographic dark energy.
Fermi coordinates are constructed as exact functions of the Schwarzschild coordinates around the world line of a static observer in the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild spacetime modulo a single impact parameter determined implicitly as a function of the latter coordinates. This illustrates the difficulty of constructing explicit exact Fermi coordinates even along simple world lines in highly symmetric spacetimes.
We use a transformation due to Bekenstein to relate the ADM and Bondi masses of asymptotically-flat solutions of the Einstein equations with, respectively, scalar sources and conformal-scalar sources. Although the conformal-scalar energy-momentum tensor does not satisfy the Dominant Energy Condition one may, by this means, still conclude that the ADM mass is positive.
We study the possibility of detecting gravitational-waves with matter-wave interferometers, where atom beams are split, deflected and recombined totally by standing light waves. Our calculation shows that the phase shift is dominated by terms proportional to the time derivative of the gravitational wave amplitude. Taking into account future improvements on current technologies, it is promising to build a matter-wave interferometer detector with desired sensitivity.

We study the use of atom interferometers as detectors for gravitational waves in the mHz–Hz frequency band, which is complementary to planned optical interferometers, such as laser interferometer gravitational wave observatories (LIGOs) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We describe an optimized atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor (AGIS), whose sensitivity is proportional to the baseline length to power of 5/2, as opposed to the linear scaling of a more conservative design. Technical challenges are briefly discussed, as is a table-top demonstrator AGIS that is presently under construction at Berkeley. We study a range of potential sources of gravitational waves visible to AGIS, including galactic and extra-galactic binaries. Based on the predicted shot noise limited performance, AGIS should be capable of detecting type Ia supernovae precursors within 500 pc, up to 200 years beforehand. An optimized detector may be capable of detecting waves from RX J0806.3+1527.
Experimental realizations of cold <sup>85</sup>Rb atom interferometers in Wuhan are reviewed in this paper. The application of atom interferometers in local gravity measurement are reported. The resolutions of gravity measurement are 2.0 × 10<sup>−7</sup>g for 1 s and 4.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>g for 1,888 s. The absolute <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> value was derived with a difference of 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>g compared to the gravity reference value. The tidal phenomenon was observed by continuously monitoring the local gravity over 123 h. A 10-meter atom interferometer designed for precision gravity measurement and the equivalence principle test is under construction, the latest status is reported for the first time.
We present a new general design approach of a broad-band detector of gravitational radiation that relies on two atom interferometers separated by a distance <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em>. In this scheme, only one arm and one laser will be used for operating the two atom interferometers. We consider atoms in the atom interferometers not only as perfect inertial reference sensors, but also as highly stable clocks. Atomic coherence is intrinsically stable and can be many orders of magnitude more stable than a laser. The unique one-laser configuration allows us to then apply time-delay interferometry to the responses of the two atom interferometers, thereby canceling the laser phase fluctuations while preserving the gravitational wave signal in the resulting data set. Our approach appears very promising. We plan to investigate further its practicality and detailed sensitivity analysis.
We propose an atom interferometer gravitational wave detector in low Earth orbit (AGIS-LEO). Gravitational waves can be observed by comparing a pair of atom interferometers separated by a 30 km baseline. In the proposed configuration, one or three of these interferometer pairs are simultaneously operated through the use of two or three satellites in formation flight. The three satellite configuration allows for the increased suppression of multiple noise sources and for the detection of stochastic gravitational wave signals. The mission will offer a strain sensitivity of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({&lt;10^{-18}/\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}}\)</span> in the 50mHz–10Hz frequency range, providing access to a rich scientific region with substantial discovery potential. This band is not currently addressed with the LIGO, VIRGO, or LISA instruments. We analyze systematic backgrounds that are relevant to the mission and discuss how they can be mitigated at the required levels. Some of these effects do not appear to have been considered previously in the context of atom interferometry, and we therefore expect that our analysis will be broadly relevant to atom interferometric precision measurements. Finally, we present a brief conceptual overview of shorter-baseline <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(({\lesssim100\,{\rm m}})\)</span> atom interferometer configurations that could be deployed as proof-of-principle instruments on the International Space Station (AGIS-ISS) or an independent satellite.
In this paper, we discuss the optimization of atom interferometers for rotation and gravitational wave detection. We consider various diffraction processes and we focus our analysis on Bragg diffraction by a laser standing wave. We show that high order diffraction should be feasible with moderate laser power.
A symmetric Ramsey-Bordé (Mach-Zehnder geometry) atom interferometer is studied as gravitational wave detector under the hypothesis of shot noise limited sensitivity. Full gauge-invariant response function is deduced via ABCD matrices approach and the resulting sensitivity is analyzed in the frequency domain. As an example, a possible use in a specific frequency range is studied in some detail.
We present an orientational quantum interferometer sensitive to gravitational waves that is based on orienting quantum objects like molecules, atoms, or nuclei in space. The detection principle is based on inducing non-sphericity to the corresponding wave functions by light-pulses. In the field of a gravitational wave these objects then possess spectra that depend on their orientation in space. In our measurement scheme we investigate the adiabatic influence of a monochromatic gravitational wave over a quarter gravitational wave period and compare the corresponding frequencies at instances with maximal and vanishing gravitational wave elongation. We therefore explore the effect over a quarter gravitational wave period (or wavelength) and the resulting frequency shift scales with the binding energy of the system times the amplitude of the gravitational wave. In particular, a gravitational wave with amplitude <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> = 10<sup>−23</sup> will induce a frequency shift of the order of 110 μHz for an atom interferometer based on a 91-fold charged uranium ion.
On small scales spacetime can be understood as some kind of spacetime foam of fluctuating bubbles or loops which are expected to be an outcome of a theory of quantum gravity. One recently discussed model for this kind of spacetime fluctuations is the holographic principle which allows to deduce the structure of these fluctuations. We review and discuss two scenarios which rely on the holographic principle leading to holographic noise. One scenario leads to fluctuations of the spacetime metric affecting the dynamics of quantum systems: (i) an apparent violation of the equivalence principle, (ii) a modification of the spreading of wave packets, and (iii) a loss of quantum coherence. All these effects can be tested with cold atoms.
We obtain the volume comparison between spacelike hypersurfaces in a Lorentzian manifold with integral Ricci and mean curvature bounds. Also we extend volume comparisons to weighted volume comparisons with integral norms of the generalized Ricci tensor.
In this paper, we study slowly rotating black hole solutions in Lovelock gravity (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 3). These solutions are obtained in uncharged and charged cases, respectively. Up to the linear order of the rotating parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, the entropy and gyromagnetic ratio of black holes keep invariant after introducing the Gauss-Bonnet and third order Lovelock interactions.
Recent research shows that Hawking radiation from black hole horizon can be treated as a quantum tunneling process, and fermions tunneling method can successfully recover Hawking temperature. In this tunneling framework, choosing a set of appropriate matrices <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> is an important technique for fermions tunneling method. In this paper, motivated by Kerner and Man’s fermions tunneling method of 4 dimension black holes, we further improve the analysis to investigate Hawking tunneling radiation from the non-extremal black hole in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> = 5, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(6) gauged supergravity by constructing a set of appropriate matrices <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> for general covariant Dirac equation. Finally, the expected Hawking temperature of the black hole is correctly recovered, which takes the same form as that obtained by other methods.
We attempt to calculate the gravitational time delay in a time-dependent gravitational field, especially in McVittie spacetime, which can be considered as the spacetime around a gravitating body such as the Sun, embedded in the FLRW (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) cosmological background metric. To this end, we adopt the time transfer function method proposed by Le Poncin-Lafitte et al. (Class Quantum Gravity 21:4463, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10">2004</a></span>) and Teyssandier and Le Poncin-Lafitte (Class Quantum Gravity 25:145020, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11">2008</a></span>), which is originally related to Synge’s world function Ω(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> </sub>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> </sub>) and enables to circumvent the integration of the null geodesic equation. We re-examine the global cosmological effect on light propagation in the solar system. The round-trip time of a light ray/signal is given by the functions of not only the spacial coordinates but also the emission time or reception time of light ray/signal, which characterize the time-dependency of solutions. We also apply the obtained results to the secular increase in the astronomical unit, reported by Krasinsky and Brumberg (Celest Mech Dyn Astron 90:267, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17">2004</a></span>), and we show that the leading order terms of the time-dependent component due to cosmological expansion is 9 orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>AU/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dt</em>, i.e., 15 ± 4 (m/century). Therefore, it is not possible to explain the secular increase in the astronomical unit in terms of cosmological expansion.
In the present work the collapse scenario of some exact non-spherical models with a minimally coupled scalar field is studied. Scalar field collapse with planar as well as toroidal, cylindrical and pseudoplanar symmetries have been investigated. It is shown that the scalar field may have collapsing modes even if it has the equation of state corresponding to that of a dark energy.
We extend Birkhoff’s theorem for almost LRS-II vacuum spacetimes to show that the rigidity of spherical vacuum solutions of Einstein’s field equations continues even in the perturbed scenario.
Single centered supersymmetric black holes in four dimensions have spherically symmetric horizon and hence carry zero angular momentum. This leads to a specific sign of the helicity trace index associated with these black holes. Since the latter are given by the Fourier expansion coefficients of appropriate meromorphic modular forms of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({Sp(2,{\mathbb{Z}})}\)</span> or its subgroup, we are led to a specific prediction for the signs of a subset of these Fourier coefficients which represent contributions from single centered black holes only. We explicitly test these predictions for the modular forms which compute the index of quarter BPS black holes in heterotic string theory on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sup>6</sup>, as well as in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({{\mathbb{Z}}_N}\)</span> CHL models for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 2, 3, 5, 7.
This paper shows that a conservative canonical post-Newtonian Hamiltonian formulation of spinning compact binaries with a pure orbital part up to third post-Newtonian order and spin-orbit contributions at the next-to-leading post-Newtonian order is explicitly integrable and regular because there are 5 independent exact isolating integrals in the 10-dimensional phase space. With the help of symplectic integrators and the fast Lyapunov indicators of two nearby trajectories, numerical investigations also support the absence of chaos.
We consider higher dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes which are currently of interest in theoretical physics. It is possible to algebraically classify any tensor in a Lorentzian spacetime of arbitrary dimensions using alignment theory. In the case of the Weyl tensor, and using bivector theory, the associated Weyl curvature operator will have a restricted eigenvector structure for algebraic types <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">II</strong> and <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">D</strong>, which leads to necessary conditions on the discriminants of the associated characteristic equation which can be manifestly expressed in terms of polynomial scalar curvature invariants. The use of such necessary conditions in terms of scalar curvature invariants will be of great utility in the study and classification of black hole solutions in more than four dimensions.
On the basis of the electromagnetic response of high frequency relic gravitational waves (HFRGWs), we research on more accurate calculation of signal (i.e. transverse perturbative photon flux (PPF)) and background photons flux (BPF) in the sycro-resonance electromagnetic system, which consists of Gaussian beam (GB), a static magnetic field and fractal membranes. According to the relationship between frequency of gravitational waves and its dimensionless amplitude, we focus on the HFRGWs with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ν</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> </sub> = 2.9 GHz, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> ~ 10<sup>−30</sup> in the pre-big bang and quintessential inflationary models. The results show the peak value of the transverse BPF (~ 10<sup>20</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) is around |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>| = 0.08 m, where |<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>| is the transverse distance to the longitudinal symmetrical surface of the GB, while the maximum transverse PPF always appears at x = 0 (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({N^{(1)}_{x} \sim 2.60\times10^{2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}}\)</span> with the optimal phase difference between the GB and the resonant component of the HFRGWs <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em> = (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> + 0.9)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> = 0, 1, 2 . . .). However, the observable PPF should be ~ 1.19 × 10<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> because of the stochastic nature of the HFRGWs’ phase. Since the decay speed of BPF is much quicker than PPF, it is hopeful to figure out the signal in some optimal regions. Moreover, we compare the decay speed of BPF and PPF in nature mode, and find the threshold value of x where PPF exceeds to BPF. It demonstrates that the limitation of our detection sensitivity comes from the strength of PPF rather than swamping by BPF. On the other hand, with the fractal membrane, the comparison between BPF and PPF provides the optimal detection area <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({x\in[0.28,1]}\)</span> m. In addition, through the calculation of shot noise and conservative estimation, we find that our sensitivity is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> = 10<sup>−26</sup> in 4 months signal accumulate time.
Dynamical models of prototype gravastars made of anisotropic dark energy are constructed, in which an infinitely thin spherical shell of a perfect fluid with the equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = (1 − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">γ</em>)<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em> divides the whole spacetime into two regions, the internal region filled with a dark energy fluid, and the external Schwarzschild region. The models represent “bounded excursion” stable gravastars, where the thin shell is oscillating between two finite radii, while in other cases they collapse until the formation of black holes. Here we show, for the first time in the literature, a model of gravastar and formation of black hole with both interior and thin shell constituted exclusively of dark energy. Besides, the sign of the parameter of anisotropy (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> </sub> − <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> </sub>) seems to be relevant to the gravastar formation. The formation is favored when the tangential pressure is greater than the radial pressure, at least in the neighborhood of the isotropic case (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> = −1).
I give a resolution of the conformal mode divergence in the Euclidean gravitational path-integral by isolating the trace of the diffeomorphisms and its contribution to the Faddeev-Popov measure.
The kinetic theory of dilute gases to first order in the gradients yields linear relations between forces and fluxes. The heat flux for the relativistic gas has been shown to be related not only to the temperature gradient but also to the density gradient in the representation where number density, temperature and hydrodynamic velocity are the independent state variables. In this work we show the calculation of the corresponding transport coefficients from the full Boltzmann equation and compare the magnitude of the relativistic correction.
The geodesic properties of the stationary vacuum string solution in (4+1) dimensions with momentum flow along the string direction are analyzed by using Hamilton-Jacobi method. The geodesic motions show distinct properties from those of the static one. Especially, any freely falling particle can not arrive at the horizon or singularity. To get into the horizon, a particle need to follow a non-geodesic trajectory. There exist stable null circular orbits and bouncing timelike and null geodesics. In the asymptotic geometry, some geodesics will be repelled by the string contrary to the case of Kerr-Neumann black hole. The light bending effect will be minimized at an impact parameter determined by the angular momentum and energy.

Of the two solutions presented, the first (republished as this Golden Oldie) is better known today as the Bertotti-Robinson solution, and the second one (republished as an accompanying Golden Oldie) is the gravitational field of an infinite cylinder. The papers have been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for republication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal.

In this easy introduction to higher gauge theory, we describe parallel transport for particles and strings in terms of 2-connections on 2-bundles. Just as ordinary gauge theory involves a gauge group, this generalization involves a gauge ‘2-group’. We focus on 6 examples. First, every abelian Lie group gives a Lie 2-group; the case of U(1) yields the theory of U(1) gerbes, which play an important role in string theory and multisymplectic geometry. Second, every group representation gives a Lie 2-group; the representation of the Lorentz group on 4d Minkowski spacetime gives the Poincaré 2-group, which leads to a spin foam model for Minkowski spacetime. Third, taking the adjoint representation of any Lie group on its own Lie algebra gives a ‘tangent 2-group’, which serves as a gauge 2-group in 4d <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BF</em> theory, which has topological gravity as a special case. Fourth, every Lie group has an ‘inner automorphism 2-group’, which serves as the gauge group in 4d <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BF</em> theory with cosmological constant term. Fifth, every Lie group has an ‘automorphism 2-group’, which plays an important role in the theory of nonabelian gerbes. And sixth, every compact simple Lie group gives a ‘string 2-group’. We also touch upon higher structures such as the ‘gravity 3-group’, and the Lie 3-superalgebra that governs 11-dimensional supergravity.
We discuss the non-perturbative renormalization group evolution of the gauge coupling constant by using a truncated form of the functional flow equation for the effective average action of the Yang–Mills-gravity system. Our result is consistent with the conjecture that quantum Einstein gravity (QEG) is asymptotically safe and has a vanishing gauge coupling constant at the non-trivial fixed point.
We review the geometrical properties of vacuum spacetimes in (2+1)-gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. We explain how these spacetimes are characterised as quotients of their universal cover by holonomies. We explain how this description can be used to clarify the geometrical interpretation of the fundamental physical variables of the theory, holonomies and Wilson loops. In particular, we discuss the role of Wilson loop observables as the generators of the two fundamental transformations that change the geometry of (2+1)-spacetimes, grafting and earthquake. We explain how these variables can be determined from realistic measurements by an observer in the spacetime.
We study the asymptotic properties of four-simplex amplitudes for various four-dimensional spin foam models. We investigate the semi-classical limit of the Ooguri, Euclidean and Lorentzian EPRL models using coherent states for the boundary data. For some classes of geometrical boundary data, the asymptotic formulae are given, in all three cases, by simple functions of the Regge action for the four-simplex geometry.
Recently there were presented several proposals how to formulate the binary relations describing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-deformed oscillator algebras. In this paper we shall consider multilinear products of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-deformed oscillators consistent with the axioms of braided algebras. In general case the braided triple products are quasi-associative and satisfy the hexagon condition depending on the coassociator <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Phi \in A\otimes A\otimes A}\)</span> . We shall consider only the products of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-oscillators consistent with co-associative braided algebra, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\Phi =1}\)</span> . We shall consider three explicit examples of binary <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-deformed oscillator algebra relations and describe briefly their multilinear coassociative extensions satisfying the postulates of braided algebras. The third example, describing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-deformed oscillators in group manifold approach to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">κ</em>-deformed fourmomenta, is a new result.
We review recent applications of equivariant dimensional reduction techniques to the construction of Yang-Mills–Higgs–Dirac theories with dynamical mass generation and exactly massless chiral fermions.
We show that the Nahm equation and the Basu–Harvey equation which provide the fuzzy funnel description can be understood as the boundary condition of the F1-strings or M2-branes probing the intersecting branes system. In particular the noncommutative geometry of a D3-brane in the presence of a constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>-field can be identified with a constant shift in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>-field modified Nahm equation. Since the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>-field modified Basu–Harvey equation can be derived from the known behaviour of the system in the Bion description, in order for this modification to be consistent with the boundary condition of the M2-branes, we derive a new type of quantum geometry on the M5-brane worldvolume. Unlike the D-brane case, this is naturally expressed in terms of a relation between a 3-bracket of the M5-brane worldvolume coordinates and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>-field.
We discuss the Hopf algebra structure in string theory and present the twist quantization as a unified formulation of the world sheet quantization of the string and the symmetry of the target spacetime. Applying it to the case with a nonzero <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em>-field background, we explain a method to decompose the twist into two successive twists. There are two different possibilities of decomposition: The first is a natural decomposition from the viewpoint of the twist quantization, leading to a new type of twisted Poincaré symmetry. The second decomposition reveals the relation of our formulation to the twisted Poincaré symmetry on the Moyal type noncommutative space.
We discuss the Euclidean noncommutative <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\phi^4_4}\)</span>-quantum field theory as an example of a renormalizable field theory. Using a Ward identity, Disertori, Gurau, Magnen and Rivasseau were able to prove the vanishing of the beta function for the coupling constant to all orders in perturbation theory. We extend this work and obtain from the Schwinger–Dyson equation a non-linear integral equation for the renormalised two-point function alone. The non-trivial renormalised four-point function fulfils a linear integral equation with the inhomogeneity determined by the two-point function. These integral equations might be the starting point of a nonperturbative construction of a Euclidean quantum field theory on a noncommutative space. We expect to learn about renormalisation from this almost solvable model.
I present an argument, based on the topology of the universe, why there are three generations of fermions. The argument implies a preferred unified gauge group of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(5), but with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(10) representations of the fermions. The breaking pattern <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(5) → <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(3) × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) is preferred over the pattern <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(5) → <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(4) × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1). On the basis of the argument one expects an asymmetry in the early universe microwave data, which might have been detected already.
We review the construction of renormalizable noncommutative Euclidean ϕ<sup>4</sup>-theories based on the UV/IR duality covariant modification of the standard field theory, and how the formalism can be extended to scalar field theories defined on noncommutative Minkowski space.
Hamiltonian formulations of M-branes moving in curved backgrounds are given.
In the context of the problem of what micro-states are responsible for the entropy of black holes, we consider as a physical toy model the electromagnetic Coulomb solution. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in the presence of an external source of charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>, the quantum state corresponding to the Coulomb solution is identified as a coherent state of longitudinal and temporal photons in a Hilbert space with negative norm states.
We argue that some features of the standard model, in particular the fermion assignment and symmetry breaking, can be obtained in matrix model which describes noncommutative gauge theory as well as gravity in an emergent way. The mechanism is based on the presence of some extra (matrix) dimensions. These extra dimensions are different from the usual ones which give to a noncommutative geometry of the Grönewold-Moyal type, and are reminiscent of the Connes-Lott model, although the action is very different.


We investigate the effects of a special kind of dynamical deformation between the momenta of the scalar field of the Brans–Dicke theory and the scale factor of the FRW metric. This special choice of deformation includes linearly a deformation parameter. We trace the deformation footprints in the cosmological equations of motion when the BD coupling parameter goes to infinity. One class of the solutions gives a constant scale factor in the late time that confirms the previous result obtained via another approach in the literature. This effect can be interpreted as a quantum gravity footprint in the coarse grained explanation. The another class of the solutions removes the big bang singularity, and the accelerating expansion region has an infinite temporal range which overcomes the horizon problem. After this epoch, there is a graceful exiting by which the universe enters in the radiation dominated era.
We evolve nonadiabatic charged spherical distributions of matter. Dissipation is described by the free–streaming approximation. We match a self–similar interior solution with the Reissner–Nordström–Vaidya exterior solution. The transport mechanism is decisive to the fate of the gravitational collapse. Almost a half of the total initial mass is radiated away. The transport mechanism determines the way in which the electric charge is redistributed.
Following Brown (Phys Rev D79:104029, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10">2009</a></span>), in this paper we give an overview of how to modify standard hyperbolic formulations of the 3+1 evolution equations of General Relativity in such a way that all auxiliary quantities are true tensors, thus allowing for these formulations to be used with curvilinear sets of coordinates such as spherical or cylindrical coordinates. After considering the general case for both the Nagy–Ortiz–Reula and the Baumgarte–Shapiro–Shibata–Nakamura (BSSN) formulations, we specialize to the case of spherical symmetry and also discuss the issue of regularity at the origin. Finally, we show some numerical examples of the modified BSSN formulation at work in spherical symmetry.
We study the evolution of massive scalar field in the spacetime geometry of Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity by numerical analysis. We find that the signature of HL theory is encoded in the quasinormal mode (QNM) phase of the evolution of field. The QNM phase in the evolution process lasts for a longer time in HL theory. QNMs involved in the evolution of massive field are calculated and find that they have a higher oscillation frequency and a lower damping rate than the Schwarzschild spacetime case. We also study the relaxation of field in the intermediate and asymptotic range and verified that behaviors of field in these phases are independent of the HL parameter and is identical to the Schwarzschild case.
We have investigated the hidden conformal symmetry of generic non-extremal rotating black holes in the five-dimensional Gödel universe. In a range of parameters, the low-frequency massless scalar wave equation in the “near region” can be described by an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> </sub> × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SL</em>(2, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> </sub> conformal symmetry. We further found that the microscopic entropy via Cardy formula matches the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the absorption cross section for the massless scalar also agrees with the one for the two dimensional finite temperature conformal field theory (CFT). All these evidences support the conjecture that the generic non-extremal rotating black hole immersed in the Gödel universe can be dual to a two dimensional finite temperature CFT. In addition, we have reformulated the first laws of thermodynamics associated with the inner and outer horizons of the rotating Gödel-type black holes into the forms of conformal thermodynamics.
In this paper we study the Geodesic Deviation Equation (GDE) in metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. We start giving a brief introduction of the GDE in General Relativity in the case of the standard cosmology. Next we generalize the GDE for metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity using again the FLRW metric. A generalization of the Mattig relation is also obtained. Finally we give and equivalent expression to the Dyer-Roeder equation in General Relativity in the context of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity.
Among various scenarios to explain the acceleration of the universe expansion, the holographic dark energy (HDE) model has got a lot of enthusiasm recently. In the derivation of holographic energy density, the area relation of the black hole entropy plays a crucial role. Indeed, the power-law corrections to entropy appear in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon. Inspired by the power-law corrected entropy, we propose the so-called “power-law entropy-corrected holographic dark energy” (PLECHDE) in this Letter. We investigate the cosmological implications of this model and calculate some relevant cosmological parameters and their evolution. We also briefly study the so-called “power-law entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy” (PLECADE).
Inflation provides a natural mechanism to account for the origin of cosmic structures. The generation of primordial inhomogeneities during inflation can be understood via the spontaneous creation of quanta from the vacuum. We show that when the corresponding stimulated creation of quanta is considered, the characteristics of the state of the universe at the onset of inflation are not diluted by the inflationary expansion and can be imprinted in the spectrum of primordial inhomogeneities. The non-gaussianities (particularly in the so-called squeezed configuration) in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution can then tell us about the state of the universe that existed at the time when quantum field theory in curved spacetime first emerged as a plausible effective theory.
We describe a recently introduced principle of relative locality which we propose governs a regime of quantum gravitational phenomena accessible to experimental investigation. This regime comprises phenomena in which <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\hbar}\)</span> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sub> may be neglected, while their ratio, the Planck mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({M_p =\sqrt{\hbar / G_N}}\)</span>, is important. We propose that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> </sub> governs the scale at which momentum space may have a curved geometry. We find that there are striking consequences for the concept of locality. The description of events in spacetime now depends on the energy used to probe it. But there remains an invariant description of physics in phase space. There is furthermore a reasonable expectation that the geometry of momentum space can be measured experimentally using astrophysical observations.
We make the cosmological constant, Λ, into a field and restrict the variations of the action with respect to it by causality. This creates an additional Einstein constraint equation. It restricts the solutions of the standard Einstein equations and is the requirement that the cosmological wave function possess a classical limit. When applied to the Friedmann metric it requires that the cosmological constant measured today, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> </sub>, be <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Lambda \sim t_{U}^{-2} \sim 10^{-122}}\)</span> , as observed. This is the classical value of Λ that dominates the wave function of the universe. Our new field equation determines Λ in terms of other astronomically measurable quantities. Specifically, it predicts that the spatial curvature parameter of the universe is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\Omega _{\mathrm{k0}} \equiv -k/a_{0}^{2}H^{2}=-0.0055}\)</span> , which will be tested by Planck Satellite data. Our theory also creates a new picture of self-consistent quantum cosmological history.
If a system falls through a black hole horizon, then its information is lost to an observer at infinity. But we argue that the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accessible</em> information is lost <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">before</em> the horizon is crossed. The temperature of the hole limits information carrying signals from a system that has fallen too close to the horizon. Extremal holes have <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> = 0, but there is a minimum energy required to emit a quantum in the short proper time left before the horizon is crossed. If we attempt to bring the system back to infinity for observation, then acceleration radiation destroys the information. All three considerations give a critical distance from the horizon <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({d\sim \sqrt\frac{r_H}{\Delta E}}\)</span>, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> </sub> is the horizon radius and Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> is the energy scale characterizing the system. For systems in string theory where we pack information as densely as possible, this acceleration constraint is found to have a geometric interpretation. These estimates suggest that in theories of gravity we should measure information not as a quantity contained inside a given system, but in terms of how much of that information can be reliably accessed by another observer.
We propose a connection between global physics and local galactic dynamics via quantum gravity. The salient features of cold dark matter (CDM) and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) are combined into a unified scheme by introducing the concept of MONDian dark matter which behaves like CDM at cluster and cosmological scales but emulates MOND at the galactic scale.
Image distortion due to weak gravitational lensing is examined using a non-perturbative method of integrating the geodesic deviation and optical scalar equations along the null geodesics connecting the observer to a distant source. The method we develop continuously changes the shape of the pencil of rays from the source to the observer with no reference to lens planes in astrophysically relevant scenarios. We compare the projected area and the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes of the observed elliptical image shape for circular sources from the continuous, thick-lens method with the commonly assumed thin-lens approximation. We find that for truncated singular isothermal sphere and NFW models of realistic galaxy clusters, the commonly used thin-lens approximation is accurate to better than 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup> in predicting the image area and axes ratios. For asymmetric thick lenses consisting of two massive clusters separated along the line of sight in redshift up to Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = 0.2, we find that modeling the image distortion as two clusters in a single lens plane does not produce relative errors in image area or axes ratio more than 0.5%.
We study the quantum field theory (QFT) of a free, real, massless and curvature coupled scalar field on self-similar symmetric spacetimes, which are deformed by an abelian Drinfel’d twist constructed from a Killing and a homothetic Killing vector field. In contrast to deformations solely by Killing vector fields, such as the Moyal-Weyl Minkowski spacetime, the equation of motion and Green’s operators are deformed. We show that there is a *-algebra isomorphism between the QFT on the deformed and the formal power series extension of the QFT on the undeformed spacetime. We study the convergent implementation of our deformations for toy-models. For these models it is found that there is a *-isomorphism between the deformed Weyl algebra and a reduced undeformed Weyl algebra, where certain strongly localized observables are excluded. Thus, our models realize the intuitive physical picture that noncommutative geometry prevents arbitrary localization in spacetime.
We discuss whether the minimally coupled massless Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields have well defined quasinormal modes in single horizon, asymptotically flat two-dimensional black holes. To get the result we solve the equations of motion in the massless limit and we also calculate the effective potentials of Schrödinger type equations. Furthermore we calculate exactly the quasinormal frequencies of the Dirac field propagating in the two-dimensional uncharged Witten black hole. We compare our results on its quasinormal frequencies with other already published.
The solution of the null non-radial geodesic in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter background is revisited. The gravitational bending of a light ray is affected by the cosmological constant, in agreement with the findings of some previous investigations. The present study confirms that the leading correction term depends directly not only on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> but also on the impact parameter and on the angular distance to the source. Using the resulting lens equation, the projected mass of the lens was estimated for several systems displaying Einstein rings. Corrections on the masses due to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Λ</em> are, on the average, of the order of 2%, indicating that they are not completly negligible for lens systems at cosmological distances.
The bound-state energy levels of a scalar particle in the gravitational field of finite-sized objects with interiors described by the Florides and Schwarzschild metrics are found. For these metrics, bound states with zero energy (where the binding energy is equal to the rest mass of the scalar particle) only exist when a singularity occurs in the metric. Therefore, in contrast to the Coulomb case, no pairs are produced in the non-singular static metric. For the Florides metric the singularity occurs in the black hole limit, while for the Schwarzschild interior metric it corresponds to infinite pressure at the center. Moreover, the energy spectrum is shown to become quasi-continuous as the metric becomes singular.
The concept of smooth deformations of Riemannian manifolds, recently evidenced by the solution of the Poincaré conjecture, is applied to Einstein’s gravitational theory and in particular to the standard FLRW cosmology. We present a brief review of the deformation of Riemannian geometry, showing how such deformations can be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert dynamical principle. We show that such deformations of space-times of general relativity produce observable effects that can be measured by four-dimensional observers. In the case of the FLRW cosmology, one such observable effect is shown to be consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe.


This is a reprinting of the paper by Brandon Carter, first published in a little-known volume of conference proceedings in 1974, that moved the anthropic principle from the realm of philosophical speculations to the subject of theoretical physics. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by George Ellis.

We calculate the Komar energy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> for a noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black hole. A deformation from the conventional identity <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ST</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> </sub> is found in the next to leading order computation in the noncommutative parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> (i.e. <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta}e^{-M^2/\theta})}\)</span>) which is also consistent with the fact that the area law now breaks down. This deformation yields a nonvanishing Komar energy at the extremal point <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> </sub> = 0 of these black holes. We then work out the Smarr formula, clearly elaborating the differences from the standard result <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ST</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> </sub>, where the mass (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>) of the black hole is identified with the asymptotic limit of the Komar energy. Similar conclusions are also shown to hold for a deSitter–Schwarzschild geometry.
It is assumed that the current cosmic acceleration is driven by a scalar field, the Lagrangian of which is a function of the kinetic term only, and that the luminosity distance is a given function of the red-shift. Upon comparison with baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background data the parameters of the models are determined, and then the time evolution of the scalar field is determined by the dynamics using the cosmological equations. We find that the solution is very different than the corresponding solution when the non-relativistic matter is ignored, and that the universe enters the acceleration era at larger red-shift compared to the standard Λ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">CDM</em> model.
Extremely Compact Stars (ECS) contain trapped null geodesics. When such objects enter the evolution period admitting geodetical motion of neutrinos, certain part of neutrinos produced in their interior will be trapped influencing their neutrino luminosity and thermal evolution. We study neutrino trapping in the braneworld ECS, assuming uniform distribution of neutrino emissivity and massless neutrinos. We give the efficiency of the neutrino trapping effects in the framework of the simple model of the internal spacetime with uniform distribution of energy density, and external spacetime described by the Reissner-Nordström geometry characterized by the braneworld “tidal” parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>. For <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &lt; 0 the external spacetime is of the black-hole type, while for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &gt; 0 the external spacetime can be of both black-hole and naked-singularity type. Then the ECS surface radius <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> can be located also above the unstable (outer) photon circular orbit. Such basically new types of the spacetimes strongly alter the trapping phenomena as compared to the standard case of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> = 0. It is shown that the neutrino trapping effects are slightly lowered by the presence of physically more plausible case of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &lt; 0, as compared to the standard internal Schwarzschild spacetime, while they can be magnified by positive tidal charges if <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &lt; 1 and lowered for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> &gt; 1. However, potential astrophysical relevance of the trapping phenomena is strongly enhanced for negative tidal charges enabling a significant enlargement of the ECS surface radius to values coherent with recent observations.
In a preceding paper we examined the question whether the spin–spin repulsion and the gravitational attraction of two aligned sub-extremal black holes can balance each other. Based on the solution of a boundary value problem for two separate (Killing-) horizons and a novel black hole criterion we were able to prove the non-existence of the equilibrium configuration in question. In this paper we extend the non-existence proof to extremal black holes.
We consider a four-dimensional simplicial complex and the minisuperspace general relativity system on it. The metric is flat in most parts of the interior of every 4-simplex, with the exception of a thin layer of thickness <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\propto \varepsilon}\)</span> along each three-dimensional face. In this layer the metric undergoes a jump between the two 4-simplices sharing this face. At <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\varepsilon \to 0}\)</span> this jump would become a discontinuity. However, a discontinuity of the metric induced on the face is not allowed in general relativity: terms arise in the Einstein action tending to infinity as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\varepsilon \to 0}\)</span> . In the path integral approach, these terms lead to the pre-exponent factor with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">δ</em>-functions requiring that the metric induced on the faces be continuous. That is, the 4-simplices fit on their common faces. The other part of the path integral measure corresponds to the action, which is the sum of independent terms over the 4-simplices. Therefore this part of the path integral measure is the product of independent measures over the 4-simplices. The result obtained is in accordance with our previous one obtained from symmetry considerations.
We compute the corrections to the orbital Lense-Thirring effect (or frame-dragging) in the presence of spacetime torsion. We analyze the motion of a test body in the gravitational field of a rotating axisymmetric massive body, using the parametrized framework of Mao, Tegmark, Guth and Cabi. In the cases of autoparallel and extremal trajectories, we derive the specific approximate expression of the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations, which are then solved with methods of Celestial Mechanics. We calculate the secular variations of the longitudes of the node and of the pericenter. We also show how the LAser GEOdynamics Satellites (LAGEOS) can be used to constrain torsion parameters. We report the experimental constraints obtained using both the nodes and perigee measurements of the orbital Lense-Thirring effect. This makes LAGEOS and Gravity Probe B complementary frame-dragging and torsion experiments, since they constrain three different combinations of torsion parameters.
We study the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-Maxwell black hole imposed by constant curvature and its all thermodynamic quantities, which may lead to the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole by redefining Newtonian constant and charge. Further, we obtain the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-Yang-Mills black hole imposed by constant curvature, which is related to the Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole in AdS space. Since there is no analytic black hole solution in the presence of Yang-Mills field, we obtain asymptotic solutions. Then, we confirm the presence of these solutions in a numerical way.
We investigate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity models performing the ADM-slicing of standard General Relativity. We extract the static, spherically-symmetric vacuum solutions in the general case, which correspond to either Schwarzschild de-Sitter or Schwarzschild anti-de-Sitter ones. Additionally, we study the cosmological evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, which is governed by an algebraic and not a differential equation. We show that the universe admits solutions corresponding to acceleration at late cosmological epochs, without the need of fine-tuning the model-parameters or the initial conditions.
Using a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, and further imposing a conformal Killing symmetry on the reduced metric generated by the dilaton, we show an Ansatz that yields many of the known stationary axisymmetric solutions to TMG.
We consider the static and spherically symmetric field equations of general relativity for charged perfect fluid spheres in the presence of a cosmological constant. Following work by Florides (J Phys A Math Gen 16:1419–1433, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">1983</a></span>) we find new exact solutions of the field equations, and discuss their mass radius ratios. These solutions, for instance, require the charged Nariai metric to be the vacuum part of the spacetime. We also find charged generalizations of the Einstein static universe and speculate that the smallness problem of the cosmological constant might become less problematic if charge is taken into account.
We confront Einstein-Cartan’s theory with the Hubble diagram. An affirmative answer to the question in the title is compatible with today’s supernovae data.
Dislocation condensation in (2+1)-dimensional World crystal can lead to an emerging linearized gravitation. In this note, we extend the (2+1)D world crystal model to 4-dimensional. By defining the density tensors of defect surfaces in 4-dimensional crystals, we establish the defect field theory of 4D crystal. We present that the proliferation of dislocation surfaces in the 4D world crystal also results in the emergence of linearized gravitation.
We study the gravitational collapse of a star with barotropic equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>ρ in the context of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({f({\mathcal R})}\)</span> theories of gravity. Utilizing the metric formalism, we rewrite the field equations as those of Brans-Dicke theory with vanishing coupling parameter. By choosing the functionality of Ricci scalar as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({f({\mathcal R})=\alpha{\mathcal R}^{m}}\)</span> , we show that for an appropriate initial value of the energy density, if <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> satisfy certain conditions, the resulting singularity would be naked, violating the cosmic censorship conjecture. These conditions are the ratio of the mass function to the area radius of the collapsing ball, negativity of the effective pressure, and the time behavior of the Kretschmann scalar. Also, as long as parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> obeys certain conditions, the satisfaction of the weak energy condition is guaranteed by the collapsing configuration.
Recently Hořava proposed a renormalizable gravity theory with higher derivatives by abandoning the Lorentz invariance in UV. Here, I construct the Hořava model at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">λ</em> = 1/3, where a local anisotropic Weyl symmetry exists in the UV limit, in addition to the foliation-preserving diffeomorphism. By considering linear perturbations around Minkowski vacuum for the non-projectable version of the Hořava model, I show that the scalar graviton mode is completely disappeared and only the usual tensor graviton modes remain in the physical spectrum. The existence of the UV conformal symmetry is unique to the theory with the detailed balance and this may explain the importance of the detailed balance condition in quantum gravity.
Along with the development of the interferometric gravitational wave detector, we enter into an epoch of the gravitational wave astronomy, which will open a brand new window for astrophysics to observe our universe. However, the gravitational wave detection is a typical weak signal detection, and this weak signal is buried in a strong instrument noise. To our knowledge, almost all of the data analysis methods in gravitational wave detection at present are based on a matched filtering. So it is desirable to take advantage of stochastic resonance methods. However, the all of the stochastic resonance methods are general based on a Fourier transformation and fall short of the matched filtering as a usable technique. In this paper we relate the stochastic resonance to the matched filtering. Our results show that the stochastic resonance can indeed be combined with the matched filtering for both the periodic and the non-periodic input signal. This encouraging result will be the first step to apply the stochastic resonance to the matched filtering in gravitational wave detection. Moreover, based on the matched filtering, we firstly propose a novel measurement method for the stochastic resonance which is valid for both the periodic and the non-periodic driven signal.
We construct three families of general magnetostatic axisymmetric exact solutions of Einstein-Maxwell equations in spherical coordinates, prolate, and oblates. The solutions obtained are then presented in the system of generalized spheroidal coordinates which is a generalization of the previous systems. The method used to build such solutions is the well-known complex potential formalism proposed by Ernst, using as seed solutions vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. We show explicitly some particular solutions among them a magnetized Erez-Rosen solution and a magnetized Morgan-Morgan solution, which we interpret as the exterior gravitational field of a finite dislike source immersed in a magnetic field. From them we also construct using the well known “displace, cut and reflect” method exact solutions representing relativistic thin disks of infinite extension. We then analyze the motion of electrically charged test particles around these fields for equatorial circular orbits and we discuss their stability against radial perturbations. For magnetized Morgan-Morgan fields we find that inside of disk the presence of magnetic field provides the possibility of to find relativist charged particles moving in both prograde and retrograde direction.

This article is a personal recollection about Josh Goldberg’s life and contributions to general relativity.
A brief survey is given of the work of the relativity group at Syracuse University during the period 1953–1957. The two main thrusts of the research during this period were the search for the true observables of general relativity and the construction of a suitable commutator bracket.
The Goldberg-Sachs theorem is an exact result on shear-free null geodesics in a vacuum spacetime. It is compared and contrasted with an exact result for pressure-free matter: shear-free flows cannot both expand and rotate. In both cases, the shear-free condition restricts the way distant matter can influence the local gravitational field. This leads to intriguing discontinuities in the relation of the General Relativity solutions to Newtonian solutions in the timelike case, and of the full theory to the linearised theory in the null case.
I treat the worldtube constraints which arise in the null-timelike initial-boundary value problem for the Bondi-Sachs formulation of Einstein’s equations. Boundary data on a worldtube and initial data on an outgoing null hypersurface determine the exterior spacetime by integration along the outgoing null geodsics. The worldtube constraints are a set of conservation laws which impose conditions on the integration constants. I show how these constraints lead to a well-posed initial value problem governing the extrinsic curvature of the worldtube, whose components are related to the integration constants. Possible applications to gravitational waveform extraction and to the well-posedness of the null-timelike initial-boundary value problem are discussed.
In this article, I pay tribute to the contributions made by Josh Goldberg toward our understanding that gravitational waves are genuine physical predictions of general relativity. Josh played a central role in developing our understanding of how a binary star system generates gravitational waves. Another key contribution came through his patronage of the 1957 Chapel Hill Conference, in his role as funding officer for the Air Force’s support of research in gravitation. I examine in detail the discussion at the Chapel Hill Conference, and show how the question of the reality of gravitational waves was resolved by a recognition that one could, in principle, construct a detector for such waves. I trace the implications of this resolution in the work of Joseph Weber, who attended the Chapel Hill Conference, and of Rainer Weiss, who did not attend but who carefully studied the key paper that Felix Pirani presented there. I conclude with a brief discussion of how a few minor remaining puzzles were resolved some years later.
In the Introduction we briefly recall our previous results on stationary electromagnetic fields on black hole backgrounds and the use of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. We then discuss static electric and magnetic test fields in a Schwarzschild background using some of these results. As sources we do not consider point charges or current loops like in previous works, rather, we analyze spherical shells with smooth electric or magnetic charge distributions as well as electric or magnetic dipole distributions depending on both angular coordinates. Particular attention is paid to the discontinuities of the field, of the 4-potential, and their relation to the source.
Affine gravity and the Palatini formalism contribute both to produce a simple and unique formula for calculating charges at spatial and null infinity for Lovelock type Lagrangians whose variational derivatives do not depend on second-order derivatives of the field components. The method is based on the covariant generalization due to Julia and Silva of the Regge–Teitelboim procedure that was used to define properly the mass in the classical formulation of Einstein’s theory of gravity. Numerous applications reproduce standard results obtained by other secure but mostly specialized method like in ADM energy for asymptotically flat spacetimes and in Abbot and Deser for asymptotically de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes, both at spatial infinity. As a novel application we calculate the Bondi energy loss in five dimensional gravity, based on the asymptotic solution given by Tanabe et al. and obtain, as expected, the same result. We also give the for Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity and find the superpotential for Lovelock theories of gravity when the number of dimensions tends to infinity with maximally symmetrical boundaries. The paper is written in standard component formalism.
General Relativity obeys the three equivalence principles, the “weak” one (all test bodies fall the same way in a given gravitational field), the “Einstein” one (gravity is locally effaced in a freely falling reference frame) and the “strong” one (the gravitational mass of a system equals its inertial mass to which all forms of energy, including gravitational energy, contribute). The first principle holds because matter is minimally coupled to the metric of a curved spacetime so that test bodies follow geodesics. The second holds because Minkowskian coordinates can be used in the vicinity of any event. The fact that the latter, strong, principle holds is ultimately due to the existence of superpotentials which allow to define the inertial mass of a gravitating system by means of its asymptotic gravitational field, that is, in terms of its gravitational mass. Nordström’s theory of gravity, which describes gravity by a scalar field in flat spacetime, is observationally ruled out. It is however the only theory of gravity with General Relativity to obey the strong equivalence principle. I show in this paper that this remarkable property is true beyond post-newtonian level and can be related to the existence of a “Nordström-Katz” superpotential.
For asymptotically flat space-times, a very satisfactory expression for the total mass/energy of a system defined at future null infinity was provided by Bondi and Sachs, in the early 1960s. A generalization of this to space-times that are asymptotically de Sitter now has particular relevance in view of observational evidence, from 1998 onwards, indicating the presence of a positive cosmological constant Λ. In this article, some of the issues involved in such a definition are examined, showing that a somewhat different attitude to mass/energy must be taken, from that which was appropriate for asymptotically flat space-times. Two tentative suggestions are put forward for a retarded mass/energy definition with positive Λ, one based on a conformally invariant integral expression whose advanced time-derivative gives the Bondi–Sachs definition in the asymptotically flat case and the other, on the author’s 1982 approach to quasi-local energy. Such expressions could have some direct relevance to the proposal of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, for which recent analysis of the CMB has provided some striking support.
The discovery of cosmic acceleration has raised the intriguing possibility that we are witnessing the first breakdown of General Relativity on cosmological scales. In this article I will briefly review current attempts to construct theoretically consistent and observationally viable modifications of gravity that are capable of describing the accelerating universe. I will discuss <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models, and their obvious extensions, and the DGP model as an example of extra-dimensional implementations. I will then briefly describe the Galileon models and their very recent multifield and curved space extensions—a class of four-dimensional effective field theories encoding extra dimensional modifications to gravity.
Using quaternions, we give a concise derivation of the Ricci tensor for homogeneous spaces with topology of the 3-dimensional sphere. We derive explicit and numerical solutions for the Ricci flow PDE and discuss their properties. In the collapse (or expansion) of these models, the interplay of the various components of the Ricci tensor are studied.
It is proposed that compatible conformal and projective structures be taken as the basic space-time structures in general relativity, with the symmetry group restricted to unimodular diffeomorphisms. Models of classical massless fields, such as the Maxwell field, interact directly with the conformal structure; while classical bodies composed of massive particles, such as solids and fluids, interact directly with the projective structure. It is suggested that this difference is the classical limit of the respective quantum-gravitational interactions, which should reflect the differing approaches to the quantization of fields and particles when gravity is neglected. Models of general relativity based on compatible conformal and projective structures should be the basis for the exploration of ideal measurement procedures, both classical and quantum.
In this paper we review the Hamiltonian description of General Relativity using a double null foliation. We start by looking at the 2+2 version of geometrodynamics and show the role of the conformal 2-structure of the 2-metric in encoding (through the shear) the 2 gravitational degrees of freedom. In the second part of the paper we consider instead a canonical analysis of a double null 2+2 Hamiltonian description of General Relativity in terms of self-dual 2-forms and the associated <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SO</em>(3) connection variables. The algebra of first class constraints is obtained and forms a Lie algebra that consists of two constraints that generate diffeomorphisms in the two surface, a constraint that generates diffeomorphisms along the null generators and a constraint that generates self-dual spin and boost transformations.
Quantum gravity effects are likely to play a crucial role in determining the outcome of gravitational collapse during its final stages. In this contribution we will outline a canonical quantization of the LeMaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models, which describe the collapse of spherical, inhomogeneous, non-rotating dust. Although there are many models of gravitational collapse, this particular class of models stands out for its simplicity and the fact that both black holes and naked singularity end states may be realized on the classical level, depending on the initial conditions. We will obtain the appropriate Wheeler-DeWitt equation and then solve it exactly, after regularization on a spatial lattice. The solutions describe Hawking radiation and provide an elegant microcanonical description of black hole entropy, but they raise other questions, most importantly concerning the nature of gravity’s fundamental degrees of freedom.
We study the measure theory of a two-site quantum random walk. The truncated decoherence functional defines a quantum measure <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> on the space of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-paths, and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> in turn induce a quantum measure <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> on the cylinder sets within the space Ω of untruncated paths. Although <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> cannot be extended to a continuous quantum measure on the full <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">σ</em>-algebra generated by the cylinder sets, an important question is whether it can be extended to sufficiently many physically relevant subsets of Ω in a systematic way. We begin an investigation of this problem by showing that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> can be extended to a quantum measure on a “quadratic algebra” of subsets of Ω that properly contains the cylinder sets. We also present a new characterization of the quantum integral on the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-path space.
A version of noncommutative geometry is proposed which is based on phase-space rather than position space. The momenta encode the information contained in the algebra of forms by a map which is the noncommutative extension of the duality between the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle.
This work uses Lorentz-signature in-in perturbation theory to analyze the late-time behavior of correlators in time-dependent interacting massive scalar field theory in de Sitter space. We study a scenario recently considered by Krotov and Polyakov in which the coupling <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> turns on smoothly at finite time, starting from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> = 0 in the far past where the state is taken to be the (free) Bunch–Davies vacuum. Our main result is that the resulting correlators (which we compute at the one-loop level) approach those of the interacting Hartle–Hawking state at late times. We argue that similar results should hold for other physically-motivated choices of initial conditions. This behavior is to be expected from recent quantum “no hair” theorems for interacting massive scalar field theory in de Sitter space which established similar results to all orders in perturbation theory for a dense set of states in the Hilbert space. Our current work (1) indicates that physically motivated initial conditions lie in this dense set, (2) provides a Lorentz-signature counter-part to the Euclidean techniques used to prove such theorems, and (3) provides an explicit example of the relevant renormalization techniques.
Physical considerations strongly indicate that spacetime at Planck scales is noncommutative. A popular model for such a spacetime is the Moyal plane. The Poincaré group algebra acts on it with a Drinfel’d-twisted coproduct, however the latter is not appropriate for more complicated spacetimes such as those containing Friedman-Sorkin (topological) geons. They have rich diffeomorphisms and mapping class groups, so that the statistics groups for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> identical geons is strikingly different from the permutation group <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sub>. We generalise the Drinfel’d twist to (essentially all) generic groups including finite and discrete ones, and use it to deform the commutative spacetime algebras of geons to noncommutative algebras. The latter support twisted actions of diffeomorphisms of geon spacetimes and their associated twisted statistics. The notion of covariant quantum fields for geons is formulated and their twisted versions are constructed from their untwisted counterparts. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Non-associative</em> spacetime algebras arise naturally in our analysis. Physical consequences, such as the violation of Pauli’s principle, seem to be one of the outcomes of such nonassociativity. The richness of the statistics groups of identical geons comes from the nontrivial fundamental groups of their spatial slices. As discussed long ago, extended objects like rings and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-branes also have similar rich fundamental groups. This work is recalled and its relevance to the present quantum geon context is pointed out.
We recently studied gravity coupled to a scalar field in spherical symmetry using loop quantum gravity techniques. Since there are local degrees of freedom one faces the “problem of dynamics”. We attack it using the “uniform discretization technique”. We find the quantum state that minimizes the value of the master constraint for the case of weak fields and curvatures. The state has the form of a direct product of Gaussians for the gravitational variables times a modified Fock state for the scalar field. In this paper we do three things. First, we verify that the previous state also yields a small value of the master constraint when one polymerizes the scalar field in addition to the gravitational variables. We then study the propagators for the polymerized scalar field in flat space-time using the previously considered ground state in the low energy limit. We discuss the issue of the Lorentz invariance of the whole approach. We note that if one uses real clocks to describe the system, Lorentz invariance violations are small. We discuss the implications of these results in the light of Hořava’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gravity at the Lifshitz point</em> and of the argument about potential large Lorentz violations in interacting field theories of Collins et al.
We extend the notion of Fermi coordinates to a generalized definition in which the highest orders are described by arbitrary functions. From this definition rises a formalism that naturally gives coordinate transformation formulae. Some examples are developed in order to discuss the physical meaning of Fermi coordinates.
We explain how to exploit systematically the structure of nilpotent orbits to obtain a solvable system of equations describing extremal solutions of (super-)gravity theories, i.e. systems that can be solved in a linear way. We present the procedure in the case of the STU model, where we show that all extremal solutions with a flat three-dimensional base are fully described with the help of three different nilpotent orbits: the BPS, the almost-BPS and the composite non-BPS. The latter describes a new class of solutions for which the orientation of half of the constituent branes have been inverted with respect to the BPS one, such that all the centres are intrinsically non-BPS, and interact with each others. We finally recover explicitly the ensemble of the almost-BPS solutions in our formalism and present an explicit two-centre solution of the new class.
In this paper, we examine the possibility of static, spherically symmetric gravitational geons on a 3 dimensional brane embedded in a 4+1 dimensional space-time. We choose a specific <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tt</em> </sub> for the brane-world space-time metric. We then calculate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rr</em> </sub> analytically in the weak field limit and numerically for stronger fields. We show that the induced field equations on the brane do admit gravitational geon solutions.
In this article we present a model of formation of a galaxy with a black hole in the center. It is based on the Lemaître–Tolman solution and is a refinement of an earlier model. The most important improvement is the choice of the interior geometry of the black hole allowing for the formation of Gyrs old black holes. Other refinements are the use of an arbitrary Friedmann model as the background (unperturbed) initial state and the adaptation of the model to an arbitrary density profile of the galaxy. Our main interest was the M87 galaxy (NGC 4486), which hosts a supermassive black hole of mass 3.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>⊙. It is shown that for this particular galaxy, within the framework of our model and for the initial state being a perturbation of the ΛCDM model, the age of the black hole can be up to 12.7 Gyrs. The dependence of the model on the chosen parameters at the time of last scattering was also studied. The maximal age of the black hole as a function of the Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> and Ω<sub>Λ</sub> parameters for the M87 galaxy can be 3.717 or 12.708 Gyr.
We propose a model for an anisotropic dark energy star where we assume that the radial pressure exerted on the system due to the presence of dark energy is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter density. We discuss various physical features of our model and show that the model satisfies all the regularity conditions and is stable as well as singularity-free.
We construct perfect fluid spacetimes by performing a conformal transformation on a non-conformally flat vacuum solution, namely the Schwarzschild exterior metric. It should be noted that conformally Ricci flat perfect fluid solutions, except those that are conformally flat, are rarely reported explicitly. In this article it is demonstrated that perfect fluid metrics conformal to the Schwarzschild exterior line element are necessarily static. The Einstein field equations for the static case reduce to a fully determined system of three differential equations in three unknowns and the conformal factor is uniquely determined in closed form. The solution is analysed for physical plausibility by establishing the positivity of the energy density and pressure profiles graphically. Additionally, the solution is observed to be causal in an appropriate limit and both the energy density and pressure is shown to be decreasing outwards towards the boundary. Finally, the weak, strong and dominant energy conditions are found to be satisfied in the region under investigation. Accordingly, the most common elementary physical conditions are met and the model is seen to be suitable for a core-envelope stellar model.
It is shown that the coupling of heat with acceleration first proposed by Eckart would have an overwhelming effect in the growth of density mass fluctuations, even in non-relativistic fluids in the presence of a gravitational field. Gravitational effects would be negligible if the heat-acceleration relation is assumed to be valid for the hydrodynamic equations. A direct implication of this result is that recent alternative first order in the gradients theories must be taken into account while describing a special relativistic fluid.
In this paper we revisit the problem of modeling radiating stars in which the areal radius is equal to the proper radius throughout the stellar evolution. We provide a new family of solutions that completely describes the dynamical behaviour of these so-called Euclidean stars. The solution satisfies all the energy conditions, and importantly, admits a barotropic equation of state.
We present two rotating black hole solutions with axion <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em>, dilaton <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\phi}\)</span> and two <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) vector fields. Starting from a non-rotating metric with three arbitrary parameters, which we have found previously, and applying the “Newman–Janis complex coordinate trick” we get a rotating metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> with four arbitrary parameters namely the mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, the rotation parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> and the charges electric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> </sub> and magnetic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub>. Then we find a solution of the equations of motion having this <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> as metric. Our solution is asymptotically flat and has angular momentum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, gyromagnetic ratio <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> = 2, two horizons, the singularities of the solution of Kerr, axion and dilaton singular only when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> cos <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">θ</em> = 0 etc. By applying to our solution the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em>-duality transformation we get a new solution, whose axion, dilaton and vector fields have one more parameter. The metrics, the vector fields and the quantity <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\lambda=\xi+ie^{-2\phi}}\)</span> of our solutions and the solution of: Sen for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> </sub>, Sen for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> </sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub>, Kerr–Newman for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> </sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> </sub>, Kerr, Reference Kyriakopoulos [Class.

From our solutions several known solutions can be obtained for certain values of their parameters. It is shown that our two solutions satisfy the weak the dominant and the strong energy conditions outside and on the outer horizon and that all solutions with a metric of our form, whose parameters satisfy some relations satisfy also these energy conditions outside and on the outer horizon. This happens to all solutions given in the “Appendix”. Mass formulae for our solutions and for all solutions which are mentioned in the paper are given. One mass formula for each solution is of Smarr’s type and another a differential mass formula. Many solutions with metric, vector fields and λ of the same functional form, which include most physically interesting and well known solutions, are listed in an “Appendix”.
In this paper we start with a generalized black string solution with three free parameters and using a Wick rotation we obtain a time-dependent cylindrical symmetric one. The so generated solution can be considered among the generalized Einstein-Rosen type that can be interpreted as gravitational waves in 5D. For some particular values of the parameters a cosmic string is found. Moreover, we study the C-energy and the deficit angle associated to the waves as well as their polarizations.
We have found some new exact static spherically symmetric interior solutions of metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravitational theories describing the equilibrium configuration of a star. Then the solution is matched to the exterior solution and thus gives a complete description of a star in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>1-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>/2</sup> theory.
The degenerate nature of the metric on null hypersurfaces makes it difficult to define a covariant derivative on null submanifolds. Recent approaches using decomposition to define a covariant derivative on null hypersurfaces are investigated, with examples demonstrating the limitations of the methods. Motivated by Geroch’s work on asymptotically flat spacetimes, conformal transformations are used to construct a covariant derivative on null hypersurfaces, and a condition on the Ricci tensor is given to determine when this construction can be used. Several examples are given, including the construction of a covariant derivative operator for the class of spherically symmetric hypersurfaces.
The maximally extended Reissner–Nordström (RN) manifold with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> <sup>2</sup> &lt; <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> <sup>2</sup> begs for attaching a material source to it that would preserve the infinite chain of asymptotically flat regions and evolve through the wormhole between the RN singularities. So far, the attempts were discouraging. Here we try one more possible source—a solution found by Ruban in 1972 that is a charged generalisation of an inhomogeneous Kantowski–Sachs-type dust solution. It can be matched to the RN solution, and the matching surface must stay all the time between the two RN event horizons. However, shell crossings do not allow even half a cycle of oscillation between the maximal and the minimal size.
Stationary thick brane solutions supported by two spinor fields are considered. Two spinor fields are used here to exclude the off-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor of the spinor fields. The trapping of a test scalar field on the brane is also considered.

This is an English translation of a paper by Matvei Bronstein, first published in German in 1936 in a long-extinct Soviet journal, in which he presented the first attempt at quantizing a weak (linearized) gravitational field, rather modern in its approach. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Stanley Deser and Alexei Starobinsky, and Bronstein’s brief biography written by Stanley Deser.





As an alternative to dark energy that explains the observed acceleration of the universe, it has been suggested that we may be at the center of an inhomogeneous isotropic universe described by a Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) solution of Einstein’s field equations. To test this possibility, it is necessary to solve the null geodesics. In this paper we first give a detailed derivation of a fully analytical set of differential equations for the radial null geodesics as functions of the redshift in LTB models. As an application we use these equaions to show that a positive averaged acceleration <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> obtained in LTB models through spatial averaging can be incompatible with cosmological observations. We provide examples of LTB models with positive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> which fail to reproduce the observed luminosity distance <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> </sub>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>). Since the apparent cosmic acceleration <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">FLRW</em> </sup> is obtained from fitting the observed luminosity distance to a FLRW model we conclude that in general a positive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> in LTB models does not imply a positive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">FLRW</em> </sup>.
We present a new approach to the question of properly defining energy and momenta for non asymptotically Minkowskian spaces in General Relativity, in the case where these energy and momenta are conserved. In order to do this, we first prove that there always exist some special Gauss coordinates for which the conserved linear and angular 3-momenta intrinsically vanish. This allows us to consider the case of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">creatable</em> universes (the universes whose proper 4-momenta vanish) in a consistent way, which is the main interest of the paper. When applied to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker case, perturbed or not, our formalism leads to previous results, according to most literature on the subject. Some future work that should be done is mentioned.
We discuss some aspects about the computation of kinematic, spectroscopic, Fermi and astrometric relative velocities that are geometrically defined in general relativity. Mainly, we state that kinematic and spectroscopic relative velocities only depend on the 4-velocities of the observer and the test particle, unlike Fermi and astrometric relative velocities, that also depend on the acceleration of the observer and the corresponding relative position of the test particle, but only at the event of observation and not around it, as it would be deduced, in principle, from the definition of these velocities. Finally, we propose an open problem in general relativity that consists on finding intrinsic expressions for Fermi and astrometric relative velocities avoiding terms that involve the evolution of the relative position of the test particle. For this purpose, the proofs given in this paper can serve as inspiration.
Einstein’s equations in a tetrad formulation are derived from a linear theory in flat spacetime with an asymmetric potential using free field gauge invariance, local Lorentz invariance and universal coupling. The gravitational potential can be either covariant or contravariant and of almost any density weight. These results are adapted to produce universally coupled massive variants of Einstein’s equations, yielding two one-parameter families of distinct theories with spin 2 and spin 0. The theories derived, upon fixing the local Lorentz gauge freedom, are seen to be a subset of those found by Ogievetsky and Polubarinov some time ago using a spin limitation principle. In view of the stability question for massive gravities, the proven non-necessity of positive energy for stability in applied mathematics in some contexts is recalled. Massive tetrad gravities permit the mass of the spin 0 to be heavier than that of the spin 2, as well as lighter than or equal to it, and so provide phenomenological flexibility that might be of astrophysical or cosmological use.
We consider Brans–Dicke theory with a self-interacting potential in Einstein conformal frame. We show that an accelerating expansion is possible in a spatially flat universe for large values of the Brans–Dicke parameter consistent with local gravity experiments.
Static spherically symmetric solutions of 4d Brans–Dicke theory include a set of naked singularity solutions. Dilatonic effects near the naked singularities result in either a shielding or an antishielding effect from intruding massive test particles. One result is that for a portion of the solution parameter space, no communication between the singularity and a distant observer is possible via massive particle exchanges. Kaluza–Klein gravity is considered as a special case.
A new dark energy model called “ghost dark energy” was recently suggested to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. This model originates from the Veneziano ghost of QCD. The dark energy density is proportional to Hubble parameter, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α H</em>, where α is a constant of order <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^3}\)</span> and Λ<sub>QCD</sub> ~ 100 MeV is QCD mass scale. In this Letter, we extend the ghost dark energy model to the universe with spatial curvature in the presence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We study cosmological implications of this model in detail. In the absence of interaction the equation of state parameter of ghost dark energy is always <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> &gt; −1 and mimics a cosmological constant in the late time, while it is possible to have <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> &lt; −1 provided the interaction is taken into account. When <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> = 0, all previous results of ghost dark energy in flat universe are recovered. For the observational test, we use Supernova type Ia Gold sample, shift parameter of cosmic microwave background radiation and the correlation of acoustic oscillation on the last scattering surface and the baryonic acoustic peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey are used to confine the value of free parameter of mentioned model.
Gravitational perturbations of the de Sitter spacetime are investigated using the Regge–Wheeler formalism. The set of perturbation equations is reduced to a single second order differential equation of the Heun-type for both electric and magnetic multipoles. The solution so obtained is used to study the deviation from an initially radial geodesic due to the perturbation. The spectral properties of the perturbed metric are also analyzed. Finally, gauge- and tetrad-invariant first-order massless perturbations of any spin are explored following the approach of Teukolsky. The existence of closed-form, i.e. Liouvillian, solutions to the radial part of the Teukolsky master equation is discussed.
The observed small, positive cosmological constant may originate from a four-fermion interaction generated by the spin-torsion coupling in the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble gravity if the fermions are condensing. In particular, such a condensation occurs for quark fields during the quark-gluon/hadron phase transition in the early Universe. We study how the torsion-induced four-fermion interaction is affected by adding two terms to the Dirac Lagrangian density: the parity-violating pseudoscalar density dual to the curvature tensor and a spinor-bilinear scalar density which measures the nonminimal coupling of fermions to torsion.
The Hubble constant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub>0</sub>, sets the scale of the size and age of the Universe and its determination from independent methods is still worthwhile to be investigated. In this article, by using the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect and X-ray surface brightness data from 38 galaxy clusters observed by Bonamente et al. (Astrophys J 647:25, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11">2006</a></span>), we obtain a new estimate of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub>0</sub> in the context of a flat Λ CDM model. There is a degeneracy on the mass density parameter (Ω<sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub>) which is broken by applying a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) as given by Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This happens because the BAO signature does not depend on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sub>0</sub>. Our basic finding is that a joint analysis involving these tests yield <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({H_0 = 76.5^{+3.35}_{-3.33}}\)</span> km/s/mpc and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\Omega_{m} = 0.27^{+0.03}_{-0.02}}\)</span>. Since the hypothesis of spherical geometry assumed by Bonamente et al. is questionable, we have also compared the above results to a recent work where a sample of galaxy clusters described by an elliptical profile was used in analysis.
The geodesic equation of the Alcubierre warp spacetime is converted into its non-affinely parametrized form for a detailed discussion of the motion of particles and the visual effects as observed by a traveller inside the warp bubble or a person looking from outside. To include gravitational lensing for point-like light sources, we present a practical approach using the Jacobi equation and the Sachs bases. Additionally, we consider the dragging and geodesic precession of particles due to the warp bubble.
By using the method of group analysis, we obtain a new exact evolving and spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein–Cartan equations of motion, corresponding to a space–time threaded with a three-form Kalb–Ramond field strength. The solution describes in its more generic form, a space–time which scalar curvature vanishes for large distances and for large time. In static conditions, it reduces to a classical wormhole solution and to a exact solution with a localized scalar field and a torsion kink, already reported in literature. In the process we have found evidence towards the construction of more new solutions.
We apply the generalization of the Parikh–Wilczek method to the tunneling of massive particles from noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black holes. By deriving the equation of radial motion of the tunneling particle directly, we calculate the emission rate which is shown to be dependent on the noncommutative parameter besides the energy and mass of the tunneling particle. After equating the emission rate to the Boltzmann factor, we obtain the modified Hawking temperature which relates to the noncommutativity and recovers the standard Hawking temperature in the commutative limit. We also discuss the entropy of the noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black hole and its difference after and before a massive particle’s emission.
Explaining the well established observation that the expansion rate of the universe is apparently accelerating is one of the defining scientific problems of our age. Within the standard model of cosmology, the repulsive ‘dark energy’ supposedly responsible has no explanation at a fundamental level, despite many varied attempts. A further important dilemma in the standard model is the lithium problem, which is the substantial mismatch between the theoretical prediction for <sup>7</sup>Li from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value that we observe today. This observation is one of the very few we have from along our past worldline as opposed to our past lightcone. By releasing the untested assumption that the universe is homogeneous on very large scales, both apparent acceleration and the lithium problem can be easily accounted for as different aspects of cosmic inhomogeneity, without causing problems for other cosmological phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background. We illustrate this in the context of a void model.
Following a previous work (García-Aspeitia in Gen Rel Grav 43:315–329, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">2011</a></span>), we further study the behavior of a real scalar field in a hidden brane in a configuration of two branes embedded in a five dimensional bulk. We find an expression for the equation of state for this scalar field in the visible brane in terms of the fields of the hidden one. Additionally, we investigated the perturbations produced by this scalar field in the visible brane with the aim to study their dynamical properties. Our results show that if the kinetic energy of the scalar field dominates during the early universe the perturbed scalar field could mimic the observed dynamics for the dark matter in the standard paradigm. Thus, the scalar field dark matter hypothesis in the context of braneworld theory could be an interesting alternative to the nature of dark matter in the Universe.
A simple observation about the action for geodesics in a stationary spacetime with separable geodesic equations leads to a natural class of slicings of that spacetime whose orthogonal geodesic trajectories represent the world lines of freely falling fiducial observers. The time coordinate function can then be taken to be the observer proper time, leading to a unit lapse function, although the time coordinate lines still follow Killing trajectories to retain the explicitly stationary nature of the coordinate grid. This explains some of the properties of the original Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates on the Schwarzschild spacetime and their generalization to the Kerr-Newman family of spacetimes, reproducible also locally for the Gödel spacetime. For the static spherically symmetric case the slicing can be chosen to be intrinsically flat with spherically symmetric geodesic observers, leaving all the gravitational field information in the shift vector field.
In the derivation of holographic dark energy density, the area law of the black hole entropy plays a crucial role. However, the entropy-area relation can be modified from the inclusion of quantum effects, motivated from the loop quantum gravity, string theory and black hole physics. In this paper, we study cosmological implication of the interacting entropy-corrected holographic dark energy model in the framework of Brans–Dicke cosmology. We obtain the equation of state and the deceleration parameters of the entropy-corrected holographic dark energy in a non-flat Universe. As system’s IR cutoff we choose the radius of the event horizon measured on the sphere of the horizon, defined as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ar</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>). We find out that when the entropy-corrected holographic dark energy is combined with the Brans–Dicke field, the transition from normal state where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> &gt; −1 to the phantom regime where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> &lt; −1 for the equation of state of interacting dark energy can be more easily achieved for than when resort to the Einstein field equations is made.
Using a cosmological black hole model proposed recently, we have calculated the quasi-local mass of a collapsing structure within a cosmological setting due to different definitions put forward in the last decades to see how similar or different they are. It has been shown that the mass within the horizon follows the familiar Brown–York behavior. It increases, however, outside the horizon again after a short decrease, in contrast to the Schwarzschild case. Further away, near the void, outside the collapsed region, and where the density reaches the background minimum, all the mass definitions roughly coincide. They differ, however, substantially far from it. Generically, we are faced with three different Brown–York mass maxima: near the horizon, around the void between the overdensity region and the background, and another at cosmological distances corresponding to the cosmological horizon. While the latter two maxima are always present, the horizon mass maxima is absent before the onset of the central singularity.
We investigate cosmological scenarios of generalized Chaplygin gas in a universe governed by Hořava-Lifshitz gravity. We consider both the detailed and non-detailed balance versions of the gravitational background, and we include the baryonic matter and radiation sectors. We use observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background, along with requirements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, to constrain the parameters of the model, and we provide the corresponding likelihood contours. We deduce that the present scenario is compatible with observations. Additionally, examining the evolution of the total equation-of-state parameter, we find in a unified way the succession of the radiation, matter, and dark energy epochs, consistently with the thermal history of the universe.
It is argued that the discovery of cosmic acceleration could have been anticipated on thermodynamic grounds, namely, the generalized second law and the approach to equilibrium at large scale factor. Therefore, the existence of dark energy—or equivalently, some modified gravity theory—should have been expected. In general, cosmological models that satisfy the above criteria show compatibility with observational data.
Equations for submanifolds, which correspond to embeddings of the four-dimensional FRW universes in five-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces, are presented in convenient form in general case. Several specific examples are considered.
A paper published recently (Hogan et al. in Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 43:1953–2009, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2011</a></span>) suggests the use of atom interferometry between satellites in Earth orbit to observe gravitational waves. The proposed altitude and satellite separation are about 1,000 and 30 km respectively. The difference in acceleration between clouds of ultracold atoms in atom interferometers near the two satellites would be detected by using laser beams between the interferometers. Because of the measurement path being very short compared with the million km or longer measurement path for a proposed laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna in space, the sensitivity to differential fluctuations in the laser phase as seen by the atoms in the two atom interferometers is very high. Problems introduced by this high sensitivity to spurious laser beam phase changes will be described in the first part of this paper. Then other limitations on the performance and on the suggested types of sources that could be observed will be discussed.
We analytically compute the orbital effects induced on the motion of a spinning particle geodesically traveling around a central rotating body by the general relativistic two-body spin–spin and spin-orbit leading-order interactions. Concerning the spin-orbit term, we compute the long-term variations due to the particle’s spin by finding secular precessions for the inclination <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em> of the particle’s orbit, its longitude of the ascending node <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em> and the longitude of pericenter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\varpi}\)</span> . Moreover, we generalize the well-known Lense-Thirring precessions to a generic orientation of the source’s angular momentum by obtaining an entirely new effect represented by a secular precession of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>, and additional secular precessions of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ω</em> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\varpi}\)</span> as well. The spin–spin interaction is responsible of gravitational effects <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">à la</em> Stern-Gerlach consisting of secular precessions of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({I, \Omega, \varpi}\)</span> and the mean anomaly <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\mathcal{M}}\)</span> . Such results are obtained without resorting to any approximations either in the particle’s eccentricity <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> or in its inclination <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">I</em>; moreover, no preferred orientations of both the system’s angular momenta are adopted. Their generality allows them to be applied to a variety of astronomical and astrophysical scenarios like, e.g., the Sun and its planets and the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B. It turns out that the orbital precessions caused by the spin–spin and the spin-orbit perturbations due to the less massive body are below the current measurability level, especially for the solar system and the Stern-Gerlach effects. Concerning the solar Lense-Thirring precessions, the slight misalignment of the solar equator with respect to the ecliptic reduces the gravitomagnetic node precession of Mercury down to a 0.08 mas per century level with respect to the standard value of 1 mas per century obtained by aligning the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> axis with the Sun’s angular momentum. The new inclination precession is as large as 0.06 mas per century, while the perihelion’s rate remains substantially unchanged, amounting to −2 mas per century. Further studies may be devoted to the extrasolar planets which exhibit a rich variety of orbital and rotational configurations.
In this paper we have considered a red-shift based linear correction in derivative of action in the context of vacuum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. Here we have found out that the linear correction may describe the late time acceleration which is appeared by SuperNovae Ia with no need of dark energy. Also we have calculated the asymptotic action for the desired correction. The value of all solutions may reduce to de’ Sitter universe in the absence of correction term.
A systematic search for different viable models of the dark energy universe, all of which give rise to finite-time, future singularities, is undertaken, with the purpose to try to find a solution to this common problem. After some work, a universal procedure to cure all future singularities is developed and carefully tested with the help of explicit examples corresponding to each one of the four different types of possible singularities, as classified in the literature. The cases of a fluid with an equation of state which depends on some parameter, of modified gravity non-minimally coupled to a matter Lagrangian, of non-local gravity, and of isotropic turbulence in a dark fluid universe theory are investigated in detail.

In this paper we obtain topological static solutions of some kind of pure <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. The present solutions are two kind: first type is uncharged solution which corresponds with the topological (a)dS Schwarzschild solution and second type has electric charge and is equivalent to the Einstein-Λ-conformally invariant Maxwell solution. In other word, starting from pure gravity leads to (charged) Einstein-Λ solutions which we interpreted them as (charged) (a)dS black hole solutions of pure <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. Calculating the Ricci and Kreschmann scalars show that there is a curvature singularity at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0. We should note that the Kreschmann scalar of charged solutions goes to infinity as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> → 0, but with a rate slower than that of uncharged solutions.
Using the theory of optimal rocket trajectories in general relativity, recently developed in Henriques and Natário (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8">2011</a></span>), we present a candidate for the minimum total integrated acceleration closed timelike curve in the Gödel universe, and give evidence for its minimality. The total integrated acceleration of this curve is lower than Malament’s conjectured value (Malament <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10">1984</a></span>), as was already implicit in the work of Manchak (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 51–60, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">2011</a></span>); however, Malament’s conjecture does seem to hold for periodic closed timelike curves.
We investigate the relation between the brane-based and the bulk-based approaches for anisotropic case in brane-world models. In the brane-based approach, the brane is chosen to be fixed on a coordinate system, whereas in the bulk-based approach it is no longer static as it moves along the extra dimension. It was shown that these two approaches are equivalent for specific models in Mukohyama et al. (Phys Rev D 62:024028, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2000</a></span>), Bowcock et al. (Class Quant Gravit 17:4745–4764, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2000</a></span>). In this paper, it is aimed to get general formalism of the equivalence obtained in Mukohyama et al. (Phys Rev D 62:024028, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2000</a></span>). We found that calculations driven by a general anisotropic bulk-based metric yield a brane-based metric in Gaussian Normal Coordinates by conserving spatial anisotropy. We also derive solutions for an anisotropic bulk-based model and get the corresponding brane-based metric of the model.
Long-range forces up to next-to-leading order are computed in the framework of the Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton system by means of a semiclassical approach to gravity. As has been recently shown, this approach is effective if one of the masses under consideration is significantly greater than all the energies involved in the system. Further, we obtain the condition for the equilibrium of charged masses in the system.
This paper discusses the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies in the context of noncommutative geometry. The energy density of such a geometry is diffused throughout a region due to the uncertainty encoded in the coordinate commutator. This intrinsic property appears to be sufficient for producing stable circular orbits, as well as attractive gravity, without the need for dark matter.
We calculate exactly the quasinormal frequencies of Klein–Gordon and Dirac test fields propagating in 2D uncharged Achucarro–Ortiz black hole. For both test fields we study whether the quasinormal frequencies are well defined in the massless limit. We use their values to discuss the classical stability of the quasinormal modes in uncharged Achucarro–Ortiz black hole and to check the recently proposed Time Times Temperature bound. Furthermore we extend some of these results to the charged Achucarro–Ortiz black hole.
The Kerr solution for empty space-time is presented in an ellipsoidally symmetric coordinate system and it is used to produce generalised ellipsoidal metrics appropriate for the generation of rotating interior solutions of Einstein’s equations. It is shown that these solutions are the familiar static perfect fluid cases commonly derived in curvature coordinates but now endowed with rotation. These are also shown to be potential fluid sources for not only Kerr but also Kerr-de Sitter empty space-time. The approach is further discussed in the context of T-solutions of Einstein’s equations and the vacuum T-solution outside a rotating source is presented. The interior source for these solutions is shown not to be a perfect fluid but rather an anisotropic three component perfect fluid for which the energy momentum tensor is derived. The Schwarzschild interior solution is given as an example of the approach.
A generalized Riemannian geometry is studied where the metric tensor is replaced by a matrix <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g</strong> of metrics. In this context new geometric quantities arise, which are trivial in ordinary Riemannian geometry. An application of this formalism to many-body alignments in general relativity is proposed, where the sub-constituents of the overall gravitational field are described by the components of <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">g</strong>. The mutual gravitational interactions between the individual particles are encoded in specific tensors. In particular, very specific approximation schemes for Einstein’s field equations may be considered, which exclusively approximate those terms in the field equations which are due to interactions. The Newtonian limit as well as the first post-Newtonian approximation of the presented formalism is studied in order to display the interpretability of the presented formalism in terms of many-body alignments and in order to deduce a physical interpretation of the new geometric quantities.
We address the spherical accretion of generic fluids onto black holes. We show that, if the black hole metric satisfies certain conditions, in the presence of a test fluid it is possible to derive a fully relativistic prescription for the black hole mass variation. Although the resulting equation may seem obvious due to a form of it appearing as a step in the derivation of the Schwarzschild metric, this geometrical argument is necessary to fix the added degree of freedom one gets for allowing the mass to vary with time. This result has applications on cosmological accretion models and provides a derivation from first principles to serve as a basis to the accretion equations already in use in the literature.
We have investigated the microscopic interpretations of the entropies for the four-dimensional extremal Kaluza-Klein AdS black hole and its higher-dimensional generalizations by using the Kerr/CFT correspondence. These newly-found Kaluza-Klein AdS black holes are charged rotating asymptotically AdS black hole solutions of gauged supergravity in four and higher dimensions. With suitable boundary conditions on the perturbations of the near-horizon geometry, it is shown that the asymptotic symmetry generators form a two-dimensional Virasoro algebra with a central term. By utilizing the central charge and the temperature of the dual conformal field theory, Cardy formula reproduces the expected Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Directly working on the ordinary metrics of the extremal Kaluza-klein AdS black holes without taking the near-horizon limit, we also re-derive their microscopic entropies.
The Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity naturally extends general relativity to account for the intrinsic spin of matter. Spacetime torsion, generated by spin of Dirac fields, induces gravitational repulsion in fermionic matter at extremely high densities and prevents the formation of singularities. Accordingly, the big bang is replaced by a bounce that occurred when the energy density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\epsilon \propto gT^4}\)</span> was on the order of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({n^2/m_{\rm Pl}^2}\)</span> (in natural units), where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({n \propto gT^3}\)</span> is the fermion number density and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> is the number of thermal degrees of freedom. If the early Universe contained only the known standard-model particles (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> ≈ 100), then the energy density at the big bounce was about 15 times larger than the Planck energy. The minimum scale factor of the Universe (at the bounce) was about 10<sup>32</sup> times smaller than its present value, giving ≈ 50 μm. If more fermions existed in the early Universe, then the spin-torsion coupling causes a bounce at a lower energy and larger scale factor. Recent observations of high-energy photons from gamma-ray bursts indicate that spacetime may behave classically even at scales below the Planck length, supporting the classical spin-torsion mechanism of the big bounce. Such a classical bounce prevents the matter in the contracting Universe from reaching the conditions at which a quantum bounce could possibly occur.
We study possible links between quantum gravity phenomenology encoding Lorentz violations as nonlinear dispersions, the Einstein–Finsler gravity models, EFG, and nonholonomic (non-integrable) deformations to Hořava–Lifshitz, HL, and/or Einstein’s general relativity, GR, theories. EFG and its scaling anisotropic versions formulated as Hořava–Finsler models, HF, are constructed as covariant metric compatible theories on (co) tangent bundle to Lorentz manifolds and respective anisotropic deformations. Such theories are integrable in general form and can be quantized following standard methods of deformation quantization, A-brane formalism and/or (perturbatively) as a nonholonomic gauge like model with bi-connection structure. There are natural warping/trapping mechanisms, defined by the maximal velocity of light and locally anisotropic gravitational interactions in a (pseudo) Finsler bulk spacetime, to four dimensional (pseudo) Riemannian spacetimes. In this approach, the HL theory and scenarios of recovering GR at large distances are generated by imposing nonholonomic constraints on the dynamics of HF, or EFG, fields.
Exact general solutions to the Einstein–Cartan equations are obtained for spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies with a nonminimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid. Some effects of torsion are revealed by solving an analogous problem in general relativity. A comparative analysis of the cosmological models with and without perfect fluid is carried out in context of the Einstein–Cartan theory. The role of perfect fluid in the dynamics of models is discussed.
Time-like orbits in Schwarzschild space-time are presented and classified in a very transparent and straightforward way into four types. The analytical solutions to orbit, time, and proper time equations are given for all orbit types in the form <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">r</strong> = <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">r</strong>(λ), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>(χ), and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em>= <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">τ</em> (χ), where λ is the true anomaly and χ is a parameter along the orbit. A very simple relation between λ and χ is also shown. These solutions are very useful for modelling temporal evolution of transient phenomena near black holes since they are expressed with Jacobi elliptic functions and elliptic integrals, which can be calculated very efficiently and accurately.
Interaction between dark energy and dark matter is probed through deviation from the virial equilibrium for two relaxed clusters: A586 and A1689. The evaluation of the virial equilibrium is performed using realistic density profiles. The virial ratios found for the more realistic density profiles are consistent with the absence of interaction.
We model the gravitational behaviour of a radiating star when the exterior geometry is the generalised Vaidya spacetime. The interior matter distribution is shear-free and undergoing radial heat flow. The exterior energy momentum tensor is a superposition of a null fluid and a string fluid. An analysis of the junction conditions at the stellar surface shows that the pressure at the boundary depends on the interior heat flux and the exterior string density. The results for a relativistic radiating star undergoing nonadiabatic collapse are obtained as a special case. For a particular model we demonstrate that the radiating fluid sphere collapses without the appearance of the horizon at the boundary.

We present the derivation, for these vacuum metrics, of the Painlevé VI equation first obtained by Christodoulakis and Terzis, from the field equations for both minkowskian and euclidean signatures. This allows to give the precise connection with some old results due to Kinnersley. The hyperkähler metrics are shown to belong to the Multi-Centre class and for the cases exhibiting an integrable geodesic flow the relevant Killing tensors are given. We conclude by the proof that for the Bianchi B family, excluding type III, there are no hyperkähler metrics.
A remarkable new idea on the origin of gravity was recently proposed by Verlinde who claimed that the laws of gravitation are no longer fundamental, but rather emerge naturally as an entropic force. In Verlinde derivation, the equipartition law of energy on the holographic screen plays a crucial role. However, the equipartition law of energy fails at the very low temperature. Therefore, the formalism of the entropic force should be modified while the temperature of the holographic screen is very low. Considering the Debye entropic gravity and following the strategy of Verlinde, we derive the modified Newton’s law of gravitation and the corresponding Friedmann equations which are valid in all range of temperature. In the limit of strong gravitational field, i.e. high temperature compared to Debye temperature, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> » <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub>, one recovers the standard Newton’s law and Friedmann equations. We also generalize our study to the entropy corrected area law and derive the dynamical cosmological equations for all range of temperature. Some limits of the obtained results are also studied.
We study the dynamical instability of a spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid which collapses adiabatically under the condition of vanishing expansion scalar. The Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes are considered in detail. It is shown that within those two approximations the adiabatic index Γ<sub>1</sub>, measuring the fluid stiffness, does not play any role. Instead, the range of instability is determined by the anisotropy of the fluid pressures and the radial profile of the energy density, independently of its stiffness, in a way which is fully consistent with results previously obtained from the study on the Tolman mass.
In this work we consider the entropy-corrected version of interacting holographic dark energy (HDE), in the non-flat universe enclosed by apparent horizon. Two corrections of entropy so-called logarithmic ‘LEC’ and power-law ‘PLEC’ in HDE model with apparent horizon as an IR-cutoff are studied. The ratio of dark matter to dark energy densities <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em>, equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> </sub> and deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> are obtained. We show that the cosmic coincidence problem is solved for interacting models. By studying the effect of interaction in EoS parameter of both models, we see that the phantom divide may be crossed and also understand that the interacting models can drive an acceleration expansion at the present and future, while in non-interacting case, this expansion can happen only at the early time. The graphs of deceleration parameter for interacting models, show that the present acceleration expansion is preceded by a sufficiently long period deceleration at past. Moreover, the thermodynamical interpretation of interaction between LECHDE and dark matter is described. We obtain a relation between the interaction term of dark components and thermal fluctuation in a non-flat universe, bounded by the apparent horizon. In limiting case, for ordinary HDE, the relation of interaction term versus thermal fluctuation is also calculated.
In this paper, we discuss the effects of electromagnetic field on the dynamical instability of a spherically symmetric expansionfree gravitational collapse. Darmois junction conditions are formulated by matching interior spherically symmetric spacetime to exterior Reissner–Nordström spacetime. We investigate the role of different terms in the dynamical equation at Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes by using perturbation scheme. It is concluded that instability range depends upon pressure anisotropy, radial profile of energy density and electromagnetic field, but not on the adiabatic index Γ. In particular, the electromagnetic field reduces the unstable region.
We have studied here black hole entropy in the framework of quantum geometry. It is pointed out that the black hole radiation consistent with Hawking spectrum can be realized as an effect of quantum geometry using a dynamical formalism for diffeomorphism invariance which envisages a discretized unit of time in the Planck scale. This formalism suggests that torsion acts within a quantized area unit (area bit) associated with a loop and this eventually forbids the Hamiltonian constraint to be satisfied for a finite loop size. We assign a spin with torsion in each area bit and entanglement entropy of a black hole is computed in terms of the entanglement entropy of this spin system. We have derived the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy along with a logarithmic correction term with a specific coefficient. Also we have shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be formulated in terms of the Noether charge associated with a diffeomorphism invariant Lagrangian.
Logarithmic corrections to the extremal black hole entropy can be computed purely in terms of the low energy data—the spectrum of massless fields and their interaction. The demand of reproducing these corrections provides a strong constraint on any microscopic theory of quantum gravity that attempts to explain the black hole entropy. Using quantum entropy function formalism we compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy of half BPS black holes in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({{\mathcal N}=2}\)</span> supersymmetric string theories. Our results allow us to test various proposals for the measure in the OSV formula, and we find agreement with the measure proposed by Denef and Moore if we assume their result to be valid at weak topological string coupling. Our analysis also gives the logarithmic corrections to the entropy of extremal Reissner–Nordstrom black holes in ordinary Einstein–Maxwell theory.
Motivated by a conjecture put forward by Abramowicz and Bajtlik we reconsider the twin paradox in static spacetimes. According to a well known theorem in Lorentzian geometry the longest timelike worldline between two given points is the unique geodesic line without points conjugate to the initial point on the segment joining the two points. We calculate the proper times for static twins, for twins moving on a circular orbit (if it is a geodesic) around a centre of symmetry and for twins travelling on outgoing and ingoing radial timelike geodesics. We show that the twins on the radial geodesic worldlines are always the oldest ones and we explicitly find the the conjugate points (if they exist) outside the relevant segments. As it is of its own mathematical interest, we find general Jacobi vector fields on the geodesic lines under consideration. In the first part of the work we investigate Schwarzschild geometry.
We study massive spinor fields in the geometry of a straight cosmic string in a de Sitter background. We find a hidden <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 2 supersymmetry in the fermionic solutions of the equations of motion. We connect the zero mode solutions to the heat-kernel regularized Witten index of the supersymmetric algebra.
The de Sitter spacetime is transitive under a combination of translations and proper conformal transformations. Its usual family of geodesics, however, does not take into account this property. As a consequence, there are points in de Sitter spacetime which cannot be joined to each other by any one of these geodesics. By taking into account the appropriate transitivity properties in the variational principle, a new family of maximizing trajectories is obtained, whose members are able to connect any two points of the de Sitter spacetime. These geodesics introduce a new notion of motion, given by a combination of translations and proper conformal transformations, which may possibly become important at very-high energies, where conformal symmetry plays a significant role.
A general class of holographic superconductor models in Schwarzschild AdS black hole with the Born–Infeld electrodynamics is investigated. It is found that the Born–Infeld coupling parameter affects the critical temperature, the order of phase transitions, the conductivity and the critical exponents near the second-order phase transition point. It is also noted that both the position of the conductivity coherence peak and the ratio of the gap frequency in conductivity to the critical temperature depend on the model parameters and the Born–Infeld coupling parameter.
We investigate de Sitter solutions in non-local gravity as well as in non-local gravity with Lagrange constraint multiplier. We examine a condition to avoid a ghost and discuss a screening scenario for a cosmological constant in de Sitter solutions. Furthermore, we explicitly demonstrate that three types of the finite-time future singularities can occur in non-local gravity and explore their properties. In addition, we evaluate the effective equation of state for the universe and show that the late-time accelerating universe may be effectively the quintessence, cosmological constant or phantom-like phases. In particular, it is found that there is a case in which a crossing of the phantom divide from the non-phantom (quintessence) phase to the phantom one can be realized when a finite-time future singularity occurs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the addition of an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>2</sup> term can cure the finite-time future singularities in non-local gravity. It is also suggested that in the framework of non-local gravity, adding an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup>2</sup> term leads to possible unification of the early-time inflation with the late-time cosmic acceleration.

The expansion of space, and other geometric properties of cosmological models, can be studied using geometrically defined notions of relative velocity. In this paper, we consider test particles undergoing radial motion relative to comoving (geodesic) observers in Robertson-Walker cosmologies, whose scale factors are increasing functions of cosmological time. Analytical and numerical comparisons of the Fermi, kinematic, astrometric, and the spectroscopic relative velocities of test particles are given under general circumstances. Examples include recessional comoving test particles in the de Sitter universe, the radiation-dominated universe, and the matter-dominated universe. Three distinct coordinate charts, each with different notions of simultaneity, are employed in the calculations. It is shown that the astrometric relative velocity of a radially receding test particle cannot be superluminal in any expanding Robertson-Walker spacetime. However, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of superluminal Fermi speeds, and it is shown how the four concepts of relative velocity determine geometric properties of the spacetime.
Extremely compact stars (ECS) (having radius <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> &lt; 3<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GM</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> <sup>2</sup>) contain captured null geodesics. Certain part of neutrinos produced in their interior will be trapped, influencing thus their neutrino luminosity and thermal evolution. The trapping effect has been previously investigated for the internal Schwarzschild spacetimes with the uniform distribution of energy density. Here, we extend our earlier study considering the influence of the cosmological constant Λ on the trapping phenomena. Our model for the interior of ECS is based on the internal Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter (S(a)dS) spacetimes with uniform distribution of energy density matched to the external vacuum S(a)dS spacetime with the same cosmological constant. Assuming uniform and isotropic distribution of local neutrino emissivity we determine behavior of the trapping coefficients, i.e., “global” one representing influence on the neutrino luminosity and “local” one representing influence on the cooling process. We demonstrate that the repulsive (attractive) cosmological constant has tendency to enhance (damp) the trapping phenomena.
We provide new exact solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell system of equations which are physically reasonable. The spacetime is static and spherically symmetric with a charged matter distribution. We utilise an equation of state which is quadratic relating the radial pressure to the energy density. Earlier models, with linear and quadratic equations of state, are shown to be contained in our general class of solutions. The new solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell are found in terms of elementary functions. A physical analysis of the matter and electromagnetic variables indicates that the model is well behaved and regular. In particular there is no singularity in the proper charge density at the stellar centre unlike earlier anisotropic models in the presence of the electromagnetic field.
We systematically study the evolution of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe coupled with a cosmological constant Λ and a perfect fluid that has the equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> denote, respectively, the pressure and energy density of the fluid, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> is an arbitrary real constant. Depending on the specific values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>, Λ, and the curvature <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> of 3-dimensional space, we separate all of the solutions into various cases. In each case the main properties of the evolution are given in detail, including the periods of deceleration and/or acceleration, and the existence of big bang, big crunch, and big rip singularities. In some cases, errors in classification and interpretation appearing in standard textbooks have been corrected.
It is believed that soon after the Planck time, Einstein’s general relativity theory should be corrected to an effective quadratic theory. Numerical solutions for the anisotropic generalization of the Friedmann “open” model <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> <sup>3</sup> for this effective gravity are given. It must be emphasized that although numeric, these solutions are exact in the sense that they depend only on the precision of the machine. The solutions are identified asymptotically in a certain way. It is found solutions which asymptote de Sitter space, Riemann flat space and a singularity. The question of isotropisation of an initially anisotropic Universe is of great importance in the context of cosmology. Although isotropisation is not directly discussed in this present work, we show that sufficiently small anisotropies, do not increase indefinitely according to particular quadratic gravity theories. It can be understood as weak isotropisation, and we stress that this result is strongly dependent on initial conditions.
We propose a Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi system mimicking a two-body system to address the problem of the cosmological expansion versus local dynamics. This system is strongly bound but participates in the cosmic expansion and is exactly comoving with the cosmic substratum.
We investigate the thermodynamic properties of 5D static and spherically symmetric black holes in (i) Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet theory, (ii) Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet theory with negative cosmological constant, and in (iii) Einstein–Yang–Mills–Gauss–Bonnet theory. To formulate the thermodynamics of these black holes we use the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy relation and, alternatively, a modified entropy formula which follows from the first law of thermodynamics of black holes. The results of both approaches are not equivalent. Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we introduce in the manifold of equilibrium states a Legendre invariant metric for each black hole and for each thermodynamic approach, and show that the thermodynamic curvature diverges at those points where the temperature vanishes and the heat capacity diverges.
The behavior of a scalar field theory near the event horizon in a rotating black hole background can be effectively described by a two dimensional field theory in a gauge field background. Based on this fact, we proposal that the quantum tunneling from rotating black hole can be treated as “charged” particle’s tunneling process in its effectively two dimensional metric. Using this viewpoint and considering the corresponding “gauge charge” conservation, we calculate the non-thermal tunneling rate of Kerr black hole and Myers–Perry black hole, and results are consistent with Parikh–Wilczek’s original result for spherically symmetric black holes. Especially for Myers–Perry black hole which has multi-rotation parameters, our calculation fills in the gap existing in the literature applying Parikh–Wilczek’s tunneling method to various types black holes. Our derivation further illuminates the essential role of effective gauge symmetry in Hawking radiation from rotating black holes.
Shape dynamics is a metric theory of pure gravity, equivalent to general relativity, but formulated as a gauge theory of spatial diffeomporphisms and local spatial conformal transformations. In this paper we extend the construction of shape dynamics form pure gravity to gravity-matter systems and find that there is no fundamental obstruction for the coupling of gravity to standard matter. We use the matter gravity system to construct a clock and rod model for shape dynamics which allows us to recover a spacetime interpretation of shape dynamics trajectories.
We considered the static spherically symmetric ensemble of observers, having finite bare mass and trying to measure geometrical and physical properties of the environmental static (Schwarzschild) space–time. The word “virtual” in the title means the test particle serving as an observer, and the “real” is the observer whose mass and its influences on the space–time metric cannot be neglected. It is shown that, using the photon rockets (which the mass together with the mass of their fuel is also taken into account) they can managed to keep themselves on the fixed value of radius. The process of diminishing the total bare mass up to zero lasts infinitely long time. It is important that the problem is solved self-consistently, i.e., with full account for the back reaction of both bare mass and radiation from rockets on the space–time geometry.
This paper explores the effect of a gravitational induction force, similar to gravito-electromagnetism but of several orders of magnitude larger, on a spiral galaxy. This would provide, because of the huge amount of mass currents associated with spirals, a rather large gravitational induction force. Standard gravitational dynamics is modified by adding an anti-symmetric force tensor analogous to electromagnetism. By choosing a special free space solution to the Einstein field equations, it was found that the resulting force field would drop off by an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sup>−1</sup> rather than an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sup>−2</sup> rule. Thus this new induction force would grow to dominance over the large distances associated with galaxies. Any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sup>−1</sup> force will produce the flat rotation curves that are observed in disk galaxies as well as explain the Tully-Fisher relationship. It would also explain why the inner core of the spirals remain Newtonian. Quite surprisingly, this simple hypothesis also seems to offer explanations for many other observed phenomena as well.

This is a reprinting of the paper by Jürgen Ehlers, Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild, first published in 1972 in a separate volume containing articles written in hounour of J. L. Synge. The original book is long out of print and almost forgotten by today. The authors present a method of deriving the Lorentzian geometry from compatible conformal and projective structures on a four dimensional manifold. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Andrzej Trautman.

Shape Dynamics is a formulation of General Relativity where refoliation invariance is traded for local spatial conformal invariance. In this paper we explicitly construct Shape Dynamics for a torus universe in 2 + 1 dimensions through a linking gauge theory that ensures dynamical equivalence with General Relativity. The Hamiltonian we obtain is formally a reduced phase space Hamiltonian. The construction of the Shape Dynamics Hamiltonian on higher genus surfaces is not explicitly possible, but we give an explicit expansion of the Shape Dynamics Hamiltonian for large CMC volume. The fact that all local constraints are linear in momenta allows us to quantize these explicitly under a certain assumption on the kinematic Hilbert space, and the quantization problem for Shape Dynamics turns out to be equivalent to reduced phase space quantization. We consider the large CMC-volume asymptotics of conformal transformations of the wave function. We then discuss the similarity of Shape Dynamics on the 2-torus with the explicitly constructible strong gravity Shape Dynamics Hamiltonian in higher dimensions.
We apply the theory of algebraic polynomials to analytically study the transonic properties of general relativistic hydrodynamic axisymmetric accretion onto non-rotating astrophysical black holes. For such accretion phenomena, the conserved specific energy of the flow, which turns out to be one of the two first integrals of motion in the system studied, can be expressed as a 8th degree polynomial of the critical point of the flow configuration. We then construct the corresponding Sturm’s chain algorithm to calculate the number of real roots lying within the astrophysically relevant domain of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathbb{R}}\)</span>. This allows, for the first time in literature, to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">analytically</em> find out the maximum number of physically acceptable solution an accretion flow with certain geometric configuration, space-time metric, and equation of state can have, and thus to investigate its multi-critical properties <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">completely analytically</em>, for accretion flow in which the location of the critical points can not be computed without taking recourse to the numerical scheme. This work can further be generalized to analytically calculate the maximal number of equilibrium points certain autonomous dynamical system can have in general. We also demonstrate how the transition from a mono-critical to multi-critical (or vice versa) flow configuration can be realized through the saddle-centre bifurcation phenomena using certain techniques of the catastrophe theory.
A weaker substitute for the too restrictive class of Born-rigid motions is proposed, which we call radar-holonomic motions. The definition is expressed as a set of differential equations. Integrability conditions and Cauchy problem are studied. We finally obtain an example of a radar-holonomic congruence containing a given worldline with a given value of the rotation on this line.
Recently, Nation et al. confirmed that fluxes of Hawking radiation energy and entropy from a black hole can be regarded as a one-dimensional (1D) non-equilibrium Landauer transport process. Their work can be extended to background space-times with gauge potential. The result shows that the energy flux of charged particles, which is shown to be equal to the energy–momentum tensor flux, contains not only the contribution of thermal flux but also that of particle flux. It is found that the charge can also be transported by the 1D quantum channel. Moreover, the entropy production rate is also investigated, which is shown to be larger than the case without chemical potential.
This paper is a sequel to the series of papers dedicated to model independent analysis of brane-like extended objects in curved backgrounds. In particular, we study cylindrical membranes wrapped around the extra compact dimension of a (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> + 1)-dimensional Riemann–Cartan spacetime. The world-sheet equations are obtained from the universally valid conservation equations of the membrane stress–energy and spin tensors. In the limit of small extra dimension, the dimensionally reduced theory is obtained. The narrow membrane becomes an effective string characterized not only by tension and spin, but also by electric and dilaton charges. The boundary of such an effective string has been shown to live in less spacetime dimensions than its interior. Precisely, the string endpoints are trapped by the surfaces orthogonal to the gradient of the effective dilaton field. The string dynamics has been shown to follow from an action functional subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions. This way, we have succeeded in obtaining a macroscopic D-brane analogue.
The Sagnac effect is a time or phase shift observed between two beams of light traveling in opposite directions in a rotating interferometer. We show that the standard description of this effect within the framework of general relativity misses the effect of deflection of light due to rotational inertial forces. We derive the necessary modification and demonstrate it through a detailed analysis of the square Sagnac interferometer rotating about its symmetry axis in Minkowski space-time. The role of the time shift in a Sagnac interferometer in the synchronization procedure of remote clocks as well as its analogy with the Aharanov–Bohm effect are revised.
This paper is devoted to study the effects of electromagnetic field on the energy density inhomogeneity in the relativistic self-gravitating fluids for spherically symmetric spacetime. Two important equations of the Weyl tensor are formulated which help to analyze the energy density inhomogeneity in this scenario. We investigate two types of fluids, i.e., non-dissipative and dissipative. The non-dissipative fluid further includes dust, locally isotropic, and locally anisotropic charged fluids. We explore the effects of different factors on energy density inhomogeneity in all these cases, in particular, the effect of charge.
We investigate the Hawking radiation and greybody factor for a scalar field on the background of the black holes in the theory of the non-minimal <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em> </sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em> <sup>2</sup>-coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity. For different asymptotic structures caused by the real power number <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em>, we find that the influences of the real power number on the Hawking radiation and greybody factor are different. We also show that the different coupling constant also affects the Hawking radiation and greybody factor.
We put independent model dynamical constraints on the net electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> of some astronomical and astrophysical objects by assuming that their exterior spacetimes are described by the Reissner-Nordström, metric, which induces an additional potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({U_{\rm RN} \propto Q^2 r^{-2}}\)</span>. From the current bounds <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\Delta \dot \varpi}\)</span> on any anomalies in the secular perihelion rate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\dot \varpi}\)</span> of Mercury and the Earth–mercury ranging Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em>, we have <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\left|Q_{\odot}\right| \lesssim 1-0.4 \times 10^{18}\ {\rm C}}\)</span>. Such constraints are ~60–200 times tighter than those recently inferred in literature. For the Earth, the perigee precession of the Moon, determined with the Lunar Laser Ranging technique, and the intersatellite ranging Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> for the GRACE mission yield <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\left|Q_{\oplus} \right| \lesssim 5-0.4 \times 10^{14}\ {\rm C}}\)</span>. The periastron rate of the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B system allows to infer <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\({\left|Q_{\rm NS} \right| \lesssim 5\times 10^{19}\ {\rm C}}\)</span>. According to the perinigricon precession of the main sequence S2 star in Sgr A<sup>*</sup>, the electric charge carried by the compact object hosted in the Galactic Center may be as large as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\({\left|Q_{\bullet} \right| \lesssim 4\times 10^{27} \ {\rm C}}\)</span>. Our results extend to other hypothetical power-law interactions inducing extra-potentials <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\({U_{\rm pert} = \Psi r^{-2}}\)</span> as well. It turns out that the terrestrial GRACE mission yields the tightest constraint on the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\({\Psi}\)</span>, assumed as a universal constant, amounting to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\({|\Psi| \lesssim 5\times 10^{9}\ {\rm m^4\ s^{-2}}}\)</span>.
In order to find out whether empty singular boundaries can arise in higher dimensional Gravity, we study the solution of Einstein’s equations consisting in a (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> + 2)-dimensional static and hyperplane symmetric perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ρ</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ηp</em>, being <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> an arbitrary constant and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> ≥ 2. We show that this spacetime has some weird properties. In particular, in the case <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> &gt; −1, it has an empty (without matter) repulsive singular boundary. We also study the behavior of geodesics and the Cauchy problem for the propagation of massless scalar field in this spacetime. For <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">η</em> &gt; 1, we find that only vertical null geodesics touch the boundary and bounce, and all of them start and finish at <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> = ∞; whereas non-vertical null as well as all time-like ones are bounded between two planes determined by initial conditions. We obtain that the Cauchy problem for the propagation of a massless scalar field is well-posed and waves are completely reflected at the singularity, if we only demand the waves to have finite energy, although no boundary condition is required.
We consider the relation between higher spin gauge fields and real Kac–Moody Lie algebras. These algebras are obtained by double and triple extensions of real forms <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathfrak{g}_0}\)</span> of the finite-dimensional simple algebras <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathfrak{g}}\)</span> arising in dimensional reductions of gravity and supergravity theories. Besides providing an exhaustive list of all such algebras, together with their associated involutions and restricted root diagrams, we are able to prove general properties of their spectrum of generators with respect to a decomposition of the triple extension of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathfrak{g}_0}\)</span> under its gravity subalgebra <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\mathfrak{gl}(D,\mathbb {R})}\)</span> . These results are then combined with known consistent models of higher spin gauge theory to prove that all but finitely many generators correspond to non-propagating fields and there are no higher spin fields contained in the Kac–Moody algebra.
A global view is given upon the study of collapsing shear-free perfect fluid spheres with heat flow. We apply a compact formalism, which simplifies the isotropy condition and the condition for conformal flatness. The formulas for the characteristics of the model are straight and tractable. This formalism also presents the simplest possible version of the main junction condition, demonstrated explicitly for conformally flat and geodesic solutions. It gives the right functions to disentangle this condition into well known differential equations like those of Abel, Riccati, Bernoulli and the linear one. It yields an alternative derivation of the general solution with functionally dependent metric components. We bring together the results for static and time-dependent models to describe six generating functions of the general solution to the isotropy equation. Their common features and relations between them are elucidated. A general formula for separable solutions is given, incorporating collapse to a black hole or to a naked singularity.
We have studied the null geodesics of the Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence matter. Quintessence matter is a candidate for dark energy. Here, we have done a detailed analysis of the geodesics and exact solutions are presented in terms of Jacobi-elliptic integrals for all possible energy and angular momentum of the photons. The circular orbits of the photons are studied in detail. As an application of the null geodesics, the angle of deflection of the photons are computed.
Spherical symmetry for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity is discussed by searching for Noether symmetries. The method consists in selecting conserved quantities in form of currents that reduce dynamics of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-models compatible with symmetries. In this way we get a general method to obtain constants of motion without setting <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a priori</em> the form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>). In this sense, the Noether symmetry results a physical criterium. Relevant cases are discussed.
Following up on hints of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation data, we investigate locally rotational symmetric Bianchi type I spacetimes with non-minimally coupled scalar fields. To single out potentially more interesting solutions, we search for Noether symmetry in this system. We then specialize to the Brans-Dicke field in such a way that the Lagrangian becomes degenerate (nontrivial) and solve the equations for Noether symmetry and the potential that allows it. Then we find the exact solutions of the equations of motion in terms of three parameters and an arbitrary function. We illustrate with families of examples designed to be generalizations of the well-known power-expansion, exponential expansion and Big Rip models in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker framework. The solutions display surprising variation, a large subset of which features late-time acceleration as is usually ascribed to dark energy (phantom or quintessence), and is consistent with observational data.
We present physical arguments-based on loop space representations for Dirac/Klein Gordon determinants—that some suitable Fermionic String Ising Models at the critical point and defined on the space-time base manifold <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({M \subset R^3}\)</span> are formal quantum states of the gravitational field when quantized in the Ashtekar-Sen connection canonical formalism. These results complements the author previous string-loop space studies on the subject.
Previously we have investigated the cosmic wiggly strings in (3 + 1)-dimensional Schwarzschild, Reissner–Nordström and Kerr black holes. As an extension the solutions in (3 + 1)-dimensional axially symmetric charged rotating black hole are investigated. The solutions for the wiggly string exhibit open strings lying in the radial direction in the equatorial plane outside the horizon.
We compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy of rotating extremal black holes using quantum entropy function i.e. Euclidean quantum gravity approach. Our analysis includes five dimensional supersymmetric BMPV black holes in type IIB string theory on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> <sup>5</sup> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>3 × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>1</sup> as well as in the five dimensional CHL models, and also non-supersymmetric extremal Kerr black hole and slowly rotating extremal Kerr-Newmann black holes in four dimensions. For BMPV black holes our results are in perfect agreement with the microscopic results derived from string theory. In particular we reproduce correctly the dependence of the logarithmic corrections on the number of U(1) gauge fields in the theory, and on the angular momentum carried by the black hole in different scaling limits. We also explain the shortcomings of the Cardy limit in explaining the logarithmic corrections in the limit in which the (super)gravity description of these black holes becomes a valid approximation. For non-supersymmetric extremal black holes, e.g. for the extremal Kerr black hole in four dimensions, our result provides a stringent testing ground for any microscopic explanation of the black hole entropy, e.g. Kerr/CFT correspondence.
The quadratic curvature lagrangians having metric field equations with second order trace are constructed relative to an orthonormal coframe. In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &gt; 4 dimensions, pure quadratic curvature lagrangian having second order trace constructed contains three free parameters in the most general case. The fourth order field equations of some of these models, in arbitrary dimensions, are cast in a particular form using the Schouten tensor. As a consequence, the field equations for the New massive gravity theory are related to those of the Topologically massive gravity. In particular, the conditions under which the latter is “square root” of the former are presented.
A thought experiment considered recently in the literature, in which it is investigated whether a dyonic Kerr–Newman black hole can be destroyed by overcharging or overspinning it past extremality by a massive complex scalar test field, is revisited. Another derivation of the result that this is not possible, i.e. the weak cosmic censorship is not violated in this thought experiment, is given. The derivation is based on conservation laws, on a null energy condition, and on specific properties of the metric and the electromagnetic field of dyonic Kerr–Newman black holes. The metric is kept fixed, whereas the dynamics of the electromagnetic field is taken into account. A detailed knowledge of the solutions of the equations of motion is not needed. The approximation in which the electromagnetic field is fixed is also considered, and a derivation for this case is also given. In addition, an older version of the thought experiment, in which a pointlike test particle is used, is revisited. The same result, namely the non-violation of the cosmic censorship, is rederived in a way which is simpler than in earlier works.
Birkhoff’s theorem for spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes is a key theorem in studying local systems in general relativity theory. However realistic local systems are only approximately spherically symmetric and only approximately vacuum. In a previous paper, we showed the theorem remains approximately true in an approximately spherically symmetric vacuum space time. In this paper we prove the other case: the theorem remains approximately true in a spherically symmetric, approximately vacuum space time.
We propose a model of dark energy consists of a single scalar field with a general non-minimal kinetic couplings to itself and to the curvature. We study the cosmological dynamics of the equation of state in this setup. The coupling terms have the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\xi_{1} Rf(\phi)\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\xi_{2}R_{\mu\nu}f(\phi)\partial^{\mu}\phi\partial^{\nu}\phi}\)</span> where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em> <sub>1</sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ξ</em> <sub>2</sub> are coupling parameters and their dimensions depend on the type of function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({f(\phi)}\)</span>. We obtain the conditions required for phantom divide crossing and show numerically that a cosmological model with general non-minimal derivative coupling to the scalar and Ricci curvatures can realize such a crossing.
Fermi’s analysis of the contribution of the electromagnetic field to the inertial mass of the classical electron within special relativity is brought to its logical conclusion, leading to the conservation of the total 4-momentum of the field plus mechanical mass system as seen by the sequence of inertial observers in terms of which the accelerated electron is momentarily at rest.
Between 1941 and 1962, scalar-tensor theories of gravitation were suggested four times by different scientists in four different countries. The earliest originator, the Swiss mathematician W. Scherrer, was virtually unknown until now whereas the chronologically latest pair gave their names to a multitude of publications on Brans–Dicke theory. P. Jordan, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and Y. Thiry, known by his book on celestial mechanics, a student of the mathematician Lichnerowicz, complete the quartet. Diverse motivations for and conceptual interpretations of their theories will be discussed as well as relations among them. Also, external factors like language, citation habits, or closeness to the mainstream are considered. It will become clear why Brans–Dicke theory, although structurally a déjà-vu, superseded all the other approaches.

This is a reprinting of the paper by Howard Percy Robertson, first published in 1933 in Rev. Mod. Phys., that is a very authoritative summary of relativistic cosmology at the stage at which it was up to 1933. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by George Ellis, and by Robertson’s biography, compiled by Andrzej Krasinski from printed sources.

The new spinor-unit field representation of the electromagnetism (Nash in J Math Phys 51:042501-1–042501-27, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24">2010</a></span>) (with quark and lepton sources) is integrated via minimal coupling with standard Einstein gravitation, to formulate a Lagrangian model of the very early universe. A completely new solution to the coupled Einstein–Maxwell equations, with sources, is derived. These equations are generalized somewhat, but not in a way that violates any physical principles. The solution of the coupled Euler–Lagrange field equations yields a scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) (comoving coordinates) that initially exponentially increases <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> e-folds from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(0) ≈ 0 to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub>1</sub> =  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(0) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> </sup> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 60 is illustrated), then exponentially decreases, then exponentially increases to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub>1</sub>, and so on almost periodically. (Oscillatory cosmological models are not knew, and have been derived from string theory and loop quantum gravity.) It is not known if the scale factor escapes this periodic trap. This model is noteworthy in several respects: 1. All fundamental fields other than gravity are realized by spinor fields. 2. A plausible connection between the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">unit</em> field <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">u</strong> and the generalization of the photon wave function with a form of Dark Energy is described, and a simple natural scenario is outlined that allocates a fraction of the total energy of the Universe to this form of Dark Energy. 3. A solution of an analog of the pure Einstein–Maxwell equations is found using an approach that is in marked contrast with the method followed to obtain a solution of the well known Friedmann model of a radiation-dominated universe.
We investigate thermodynamics and phase transition of the Reissner–Nordström black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using thermodynamical laws of black holes, we derive the expressions of some thermodynamics quantities for the Reissner–Nordström black hole surrounded by quintessence. The variations of the temperature and heat capacity with the entropy were plotted for different values of the state parameter related to the quintessence, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> </sub>, and the normalization constant related to the density of quintessence <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>. We show that when varying the entropy of the black hole a phase transition is observed in the black hole. Moreover, when increasing the density of quintessence, the transition point is shifted to lower entropy and the temperature of the black hole decreases.
We show that in the background of a stationary and axisymmetric black hole, there is a particular spinor field whose “conserved current” interpolates between the null Killing vector on the horizon and the time Killing vector at the spatial infinity. The spinor field only needs to satisfy a very general and simple constraint.
We develop a technique for the reconstruction of the potential for a scalar field or a tachyon field, reproducing a given cosmological evolution in a closed and open isotropic cosmological models. Such potentials are explicitly written down for the cases of the evolutions driven by a generic barotropic fluid and by radiation plus a cosmological constant, for the case of a scalar field. For tachyon and pseudo-tachyon fields the potentials are reconstructed for some special cases, corresponding to particular values of the barotropic index.
The fate of the phantom dark energy universe in semiclassical and loop quantum cosmology is investigated. In semiclassical cosmology, quantum corrections coming from massless fields conformally coupled with gravity are considered, to see if they can lead to avoidance of the Big Rip singularity, which shows up in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, filled with phantom dark energy and modeled by an equation of state of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ωρ</em> with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> &lt; −1 (this model is justified by WMAP observations which indicate that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ω</em> = −1.10 ± 0.14 Komatsu (Astrophys. J. Suppl. Ser. 192:18, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2011</a></span>). The dynamics of the model are discussed for all values of the two parameters, named <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> &gt; 0 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">β</em> &lt; 0, which come from quantum corrections. It is concluded that, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({-1&lt;\frac{\beta}{3\alpha} &lt;0 }\)</span>, almost all solutions develop future singularities (the corresponding scale factor and energy density go down to zero in finite time). However, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({-1&gt;\frac{\beta}{3\alpha}}\)</span>, almost all solutions describe a universe bouncing infinitely many times (an oscillating universe). On the other hand, in loop quantum cosmology, the classical Friedmann equation can be replaced by the so-called tree-level Friedmann equation. This equation contains a term proportional to the square of the energy density which leads to the avoidance of the Big Rip singularity.
We investigate the geodesic motion of pseudo-classical spinning particles in the Taub-NUT–de Sitter spacetime. We obtain the conserved quantities from the solutions of the generalized Killing equations for spinning spaces. Applying the formalism the motion of a pseudo-classical Dirac fermion is analyzed on a cone and plane.
In the Randall-Sundrum model with one brane, we found the approximate and exact solutions for gravitational potentials and accelerations of test bodies in these potentials for different geometrical configurations. We applied these formulas for calculation of the gravitational interaction between two spheres and found the approximate and exact expressions for the relative force corrections to the Newton’s gravitational force. We demonstrated that the difference between relative force corrections for the approximate and exact cases increases with the parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> (for the fixed distance <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> between centers of the spheres). On the other hand, this difference increases with decreasing of the distance between the centers of the spheres (for the fixed curvature scale parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>). We got the upper limit for the curvature scale parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em> ≲ 10 <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em>m. For these values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>, the difference between the approximate and exact solutions is negligible.
We construct a new class of spinning magnetic string solutions in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity with constant scalar curvature. These solutions which produce a longitudinal magnetic field have no curvature singularity and no horizon, but have a conic geometry with a deficit angle. We also generalize this class of solutions to the case of spinning magnetic solutions with one rotation parameter. We find that the spinning string has a net electric charge which is proportional to the rotation parameter. With choosing a suitable counterterm, we remove the divergences of the action. The conserved quantities of the solutions are also calculated by using the counterterm method.
In this paper we discuss the creation of our universe using the idea of extra dimensions. The initial, multidimensional Lagrangian contains only metric tensor. We have found many sets of the numerical values of the Lagrangian parameters corresponding to the observed low-energy physics of our Universe. Different initial parameters can lead to the same values of fundamental constants by the appropriate choice of a dimensional reduction cascade. This result diminishes the significance of the search for the ‘unique’ initial Lagrangian. We also have obtained a large number of low-energy vacua, which is known as ‘landscape’ in the string theory.
A parameter-independent notion of stationary slow motion is formulated then applied to the case of stationary rotation of massless trapped ghosts. The excitations correspond to a rotation mode with angular momentum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em> ≠ 0 and twist modes. It is found that the rotation mode, which has no parity, causes excess in the angular velocity of dragged distant coordinate frames in one sheet of the wormhole while in the other sheet the angular velocity of the ghosts is that of rotating stars: 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">J</em>/<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sup>3</sup>. As to the twist modes, which all have parity, they cause excess in the angular velocity of one of the throat’s poles with respect to the other.
Behaviors of quark matter and strange quark matter which exist in the first seconds of the early Universe in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity are studied for Bianchi I and V universes. In this respect, we obtain exact solutions of the modified Einstein field equations by using anisotropy feature of Bianchi I and V space-times. In particular, we investigate exact <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) functions for Bianchi I as the contribution of strange quark and quark matter. Also, we have concluded that quark matter may contribute to the early acceleration of the universe since quark matter behaves like phantom-type dark energy. Furthermore, obtained <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) solutions represents early eras of the Universe since <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) solutions for quark matter coincide with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) equations for inflation. From this point, we can reach the conclusion that quarks may be source of the early dark energy of the universe or source of little inflation due to their repulsive force.
We study the critical points of a universe dominated by Eigenspinoren des Ladungskonjugationsoperatorsin (ELKO) spinor field dark energy and a barotropic matter without considering a specific potential or interaction. The coincidence problem and attractor solutions are discussed at late time, and it is shown that the coincidence problem can not be solved in this model.
In the framework of the Einstein–Palatini formalism, even though the projective transformation connecting the arbitrary connection with the Levi-Civita connection has been floating in the literature for a long time and perhaps the result was implicitly known in the affine gravity community, yet as far as we know Julia and Silva were the first to realise its gauge character. We rederive this result by using the Rosenfeld–Dirac–Bergmann approach to constrained Hamiltonian systems and do a comprehensive self contained analysis establishing the equivalence of the Einstein–Palatini and the metric formulations without having to impose the gauge choice that the connection is symmetric. We also make contact with the the Einstein–Cartan theory when the matter Lagrangian has fermions.
This paper deals with the dynamics of scalar field thin shell in the Reissner-Nordstr<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ö</em>m geometry. The Israel junction conditions between Reissner-Nordstr<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ö</em>m spacetimes are derived, which lead to the equation of motion of scalar field shell and Klien–Gordon equation. These equations are solved numerically by taking scalar field model with the quadratic scalar potential. It is found that solution represents the expanding and collapsing scalar field shell. For the better understanding of this problem, we investigate the case of massless scalar field (by taking the scalar field potential zero). Also, we evaluate the scalar field potential when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em> is an explicit function of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>. We conclude that both massless as well as massive scalar field shell can expand to infinity at constant rate or collapse to zero size forming a curvature singularity or bounce under suitable conditions.
Attempts to understand Hawking radiation as tunnelling across a black hole horizon require the consideration of singular integrals. Although Schwarzschild coordinates lead to the standard Hawking temperature, isotropic radial coordinates may appear to produce an incorrect value. It is demonstrated here how the proper regularization of singular integrals leads to the standard temperature for the isotropic radial coordinates as well as for other smooth transformations of the radial variable, which of course describe the same black hole.
The present paper fills in the final gap in the search and description of different equilibrium states in the two-body systems consisting of one extreme and one non-extreme components. In the ‘extreme-non-extreme’ case of charged spinning masses we obtain, by making use of an appropriate exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations and solving numerically the corresponding balance equations, the first examples of the ‘extreme-hyperextreme’ equilibrium configurations characterized by positive Komar masses of both Kerr–Newman constituents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that equilibrium in the ‘extreme-subextreme’ stationary electrovac systems is also possible, but all particular equilibrium configurations of this type found by us involve negative mass of one of the constituents. In the electrostatic case which admits a purely analytic treatment we give a rigorous proof of the non-existence of the ‘extreme-non-extreme’ equilibrium configurations in the framework of the double-Reissner–Nordström solution. At the same time, the electrostatic equilibrium between an extreme and a subextreme black holes can be achieved in the uniform external field, provided the two constituents form a specific dihole with zero net charge.
Modifying a method by Horowitz and Hubeny for asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes, we establish the classical stability of the quasinormal modes of the de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore using a straightforward method we calculate the de Sitter quasinormal frequencies of the gravitational perturbations and discuss some properties of the radial functions of these quasinormal modes.
We present two complementary approaches for determining the reference for the covariant Hamiltonian boundary term quasi-local energy and test them on spherically symmetric spacetimes. On the one hand, we isometrically match the 2-surface and extremize the energy. This can be done in two ways, which we call programs I (without constraint) and II (with additional constraints). On the other hand, we match the orthonormal 4-frames of the dynamic and the reference spacetimes. Then, if we further specify the observer by requiring the reference displacement to be the timelike Killing vector of the reference, the result is the same as program I, and the energy can be positive, zero, or even negative. If, instead, we require that the Lie derivatives of the two-area along the displacement vector in both the dynamic and reference spacetimes to be the same, the result is the same as program II, and it satisfies the usual criteria: the energies are non-negative and vanish only for Minkowski (or anti-de Sitter) spacetime.

We study compactification of extra dimensions in a theory of Dirac–Born–Infeld type gravity. We investigate the solution for Minkowski spacetime with an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> extra space as well as that for de Sitter spacetime (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>4</sup>) with an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> <sup>2</sup> extra space. They are derived by the effective potential method in the presence of the magnetic flux on the extra sphere. We also consider the higher-dimensional generalization of the solutions. We find that, in a certain model, the radius of the extra space has a minimum value independent of the higher-dimensional Newton constant.
In this paper, we consider the effect of two right-handed sneutrino curvaton decays and investigate the parameter space. We compare the difference of the result between single- and two-curvaton cases. We find one Yukawa coupling of the right-handed snetrinos can be as large as λ ~ 0.1 while the other one is much smaller. When the curvatons decay, we assume both of them subdominate the energy density of the universe. We find that, unlike a single curvaton case, here a small or negative, as well as a large <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">NL</em> </sub> can be generated.
We present elliptic solutions to the background equations describing the Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi metric as well as the homogeneous Friedmann equation, in the presence of dust, curvature and a cosmological constant Λ. For none of the presented solutions any numerical <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">integration</em> has to be performed. All presented solutions are given for expanding and collapsing phases, preserving continuity in time and radius; both radial and angular scale functions are given. Hence, these solutions describe the complete spacetime of a collapsing spherical object in an expanding universe, as well as those of ever expanding objects. In the appendix we present for completeness a solution of the Friedmann equation in the additional presence of radiation, only valid for the Robertson–Walker metric.
In the framework of renormalization-group improved cosmologies, we analyze both theoretically and observationally the exact and general solution of the matter-dominated cosmological equations, by using the expression of the cosmological term as a function of the Newton parameter already determined by the integration method employed in a previous paper. A rough comparison between such a model and the concordance ΛCDM model from the point of view of the magnitude-redshift relationship has been already considered, without showing any appreciable differences. Here we test our model by using astrophysical data (the Union2 type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram constructed from some gamma ray bursts luminosity distance indicator), to constrain its parameters. We also apply a cosmographic approach to our cosmological model. In order to estimate the cosmographic parameters we fit a large dataset, including not only the Hubble diagram, as traced by SNIa and gamma ray bursts, but also the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>) measurements from passively evolving galaxies, baryon acoustic oscillations and the distance priors from the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy spectrum. We show that this matter-dominated cosmological model with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term is indeed compatible with the observations above. The cosmographic approach adopted confirms such conclusions. Last, it seems possible to include radiation into the model, since numerical integration of the equations derived by the presence of both radiation and matter shows that, after inflation, the total density parameter is initially dominated by the radiation contribution and later by the matter one.
We investigate the evolution of non-adiabatic collapse of a shear-free spherically symmetric stellar configuration with anisotropic stresses accompanied with radial heat flux. The collapse begins from a curvature singularity with infinite mass and size on an inhomogeneous space–time background. The collapse is found to proceed without formation of an even horizon to singularity when the collapsing configuration radiates all its mass energy. The impact of inhomogeneity on various parameters of the collapsing stellar configuration is examined in some specific space–time backgrounds.
We have considered an action of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">L</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> </sub> describing Einstein’s gravity plus a function of the torsion scalar. By considering an exact power-law solution we have obtained the Friedmann equation as a differential equation for the function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) in spatially flat universe and obtained the real valued solutions of this equation for some power-law solutions. We have also studied the power-law solutions when the universe enters a Phantom phase and shown that such solutions may exist for some <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) solutions.
The entropy spectrum of a spherically symmetric black hole was derived via the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule in Majhi and Vagenas’s work. Extending this work to charged and rotating black holes, we quantize the horizon area and the entropy of an Einstein–Maxwell–Dilaton–Axion black hole via the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule and the adiabatic invariance. The result shows the area spectrum and the entropy spectrum are respectively equally spaced and independent on the parameters of the black hole.
Newton’s Law of Gravitation has been tested at small values <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> of the acceleration, down to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a ≈ </em> 10<sup>−10</sup> ms<sup>−2</sup>, the approximate value of MOND’s constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> <sub>0</sub>. Within experimental errors no deviations from Newton’s Law were found. A comparison with six versions of the MOND interpolation function is given. Under the assumptions made in this paper one of the versions can be excluded.
We show that the description of the space-time of general relativity as a diagonal four dimensional submanifold immersed in an eight dimensional hypercomplex manifold, in torsionless case, leads to a geometrical origin of the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant appears naturally in the new field equations and its expression is given as the norm of a four-vector <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>, i.e., Λ = 6<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μν</em> </sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">μ</em> </sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> <sup>ν</sup> and where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> can be determined from the Bianchi identities. Consequently, the cosmological constant is space-time dependent, a Lorentz invariant scalar, and may be positive, negative or null. The resulting energy momentum tensor of the dark energy depends on the cosmological constant and its first derivative with respect to the metric. As an application, we obtain the spherical solution for the field equations. In cosmology, the modified Friedmann equations are proposed and a condition on Λ for an accelerating universe is deduced. For a particular case of the vector <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>, we find a decaying cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Lambda\propto a(t)^{-6\alpha}}\)</span>.
The Higgs mechanism for gravity, as proposed by ’t Hooft (arXiv: 0708.3184[hep-th]), can be improved by including determinantal invariants. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of determinantal invariants in regard to their effects on the mass induction for graviton. We find that part of the potential that depends on the determinantal invariants, if obtains a specific form, can significantly influence the dependence of the graviton mass on the model parameters.
We consider a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional model of gravity with non-linear “scalar fields” as a matter source. The model is defined on the product manifold <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, which contains <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> Einstein factor spaces. General cosmological type solutions to the field equations are obtained when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> − 1 factor spaces are Ricci-flat, e.g. when one space <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> <sub>1</sub> of dimension <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> <sub>1</sub> &gt; 1 has nonzero scalar curvature. The solutions are defined up to solutions to geodesic equations corresponding to a sigma model target space. Several examples of sigma models are presented. A subclass of spherically symmetric solutions is studied and a restricted version of “no-hair theorem” for black holes is proved. For the case <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> <sub>1</sub> = 2 a subclass of latent soliton solutions is singled out.
The necessary and sufficient condition for the thermodynamical universality of the static spherically symmetric Lovelock black hole is that it is the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>th order pure Lovelock Λ-vacuum solution. By universality we mean the thermodynamical parameters: temperature and entropy always bear the same relation to the horizon radius for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> + 1, 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> + 2 dimensions for all <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> which is the degree of the Lovelock polynomial. For instance, the entropy always goes in terms of the horizon radius as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> <span class="Stack"> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em> </sub> <sup>2</sup> </span>, respectively for the odd and even dimensions. Not only that the universality uniquely identifies the pure Lovelock black hole with Λ, it is the characterizing property of this class of black holes.
We derive explicit and exact expressions for the physical velocity of a free particle comoving with the Hubble flow as measured by a static observer, and for the frequency shift of light emitted by a comoving source and received, again, by a static observer. The expressions make it clear that an interpretation of the redshift as a kind of Doppler effect only makes sense when the distance between the observer and the source vanishes exactly.
We first study dark energy models with a minimally-coupled scalar field and generalized exponential potentials, admitting exact solutions for the cosmological equations: actually, it turns out that for this class of potentials the Einstein field equations exhibit alternative Lagrangians, and are completely integrable and separable. We analyze their analytical solutions, especially discussing when they are compatible with a late time quintessential expansion of the universe. As a further issue, we discuss how quintessential scalar fields with exponential potentials can be connected to the inflationary phase, building up a quintessential inflationary scenario: actually, it turns out that the transition from inflation toward late-time exponential quintessential tail admits a kination period, which is an indispensable ingredient of this kind of theoretical models. All such considerations have been made by including also radiation into the model.
Applying the 1 + 3 formalism we write down the full set of equations governing the structure and the evolution of self-gravitating cylindrically symmetric dissipative fluids with anisotropic stresses, in terms of scalar quantities obtained from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor (structure scalars), in the context of general relativity. These scalars which have been shown previously (in the spherically symmetric case) to be related to fundamental properties of the fluid distribution, such as: energy density, energy density inhomogeneity, local anisotropy of pressure, dissipative flux, active gravitational mass etc, are shown here to play also a very important role in the dynamics of cylindrically symmetric fluids. It is also shown that in the static case, all possible solutions to Einstein equations may be expressed explicitly through three of these scalars.
The motion of a particle in the Tolman metric generated by a photon gas source is discussed. Both the case of geodesic motion and motion with nonzero friction, due to photon scattering effects, are analyzed. In the Minkowski limit, the particle moves along a straight line segment with a decelerated motion, reaching the endpoint at zero speed. The curved case shows a qualitatively different behavior; the geodesic motion consists of periodic orbits, confined within a specific radial interval. Under the effect of frictional drag, this radial interval closes up in time and in all our numerical simulations the particle ends up in the singularity at the center.
In the study of horizon thermodynamics and emergent gravity two natural expressions for energy, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> = 2<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T S</em> (equipartition energy) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T S</em> (Noether energy) arise which differ by a factor 2. I clarify the role of these two expressions in different contexts and show how <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T S</em> is also closely related to the Noether charge arising from the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">boundary term</em> of the Einstein–Hilbert action.
In this paper, it is shown that the magnetic helicity dissipation per unit volume, coupled with the longitudinal conductivity, causes enhancement of the kinematic rotation of the electric (and magnetic) lines if the npe-plasma vorticity vector aligns with the electric (or the magnetic) field. In the case of a rigidly rotating npe-plasma under the influence of a strong magnetic field, the electric lines are rotating faster than the magnetic lines. It is deduced that the orthogonality of the electric and magnetic fields is an essential condition for the conduction current to remain finite in the limit of infinite electric conductivity of the npe-plasma. In this case, the magnetic field is not frozen into the npe-plasma, but the magnetic flux in the magnetic tube is conserved. The hybrid helicity is conserved if the “magneto-vorticity” vector is tangent to the level surfaces of constant entropy per baryon. The “magneto-vorticity” lines are rotating on the level surfaces of constant entropy per baryon due to the electromagnetic energy flow in the direction of the npe-plasma vorticity and the chemical potential variation locked with the kinematic rotation of the npe-plasma flow lines. In the case of an isentropic npe-plasma flow, there exists a family of timelike 2-surfaces spanned by the “magneto-vorticity” lines and the npe-plasma flow lines. In this case, the electric field is normal to such a family of timelike 2-surfaces. Maxwell like equations satisfied by “magneto-vorticity” bivector field are solved in axially symmetric stationary case. It is shown that the npe-plasma is in differential rotation in such a way that its each plasma shell (i.e., plasma surface spanned by “magneto-vorticity” lines) is rotating differentially without continually winding up “magneto-vorticity” lines frozen into the npe-plasma. It is also found that gravitational isorotation and Ferraro’s law of isorotation are intimately connected to each other because of coexistence of both the plasma vorticity and the magnetic field due to interaction between the electromagnetic field and npe-plasma flows.
We study the existence and properties of wormhole throats in modified <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity theory. Specifically, we concentrate on the cases where the lapse is not necessarily constant, and hence are not limited to the zero tidal force scenarios. In the class of theories whose actions are generated by Lagrangians of the form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) = ∑ <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> <sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sub> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> <sup> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> </sup> we find parameters which allow for the existence of energy condition respecting throats, which do not exist in Einstein gravity. We also consider the effect of the modified action on the anisotropy of the models, and find that modified gravity can minimize the amount of anisotropy required to support the existence of a throat. In both these respects, the sector containing theories with positive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> is more promising than the negative <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> sector in comparison to Einstein gravity alone, with large <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> being most favorable.
The Hamiltonian approach to the General Relativity is formulated as a joint nonlinear realization of conformal and affine symmetries by means of the Dirac scalar dilaton and the Maurer–Cartan forms. The dominance of the Casimir vacuum energy of physical fields provides a good description of the type Ia supernova luminosity distance—redshift relation. Introducing the uncertainty principle at the Planck’s epoch within our model, we obtain the hierarchy of the Universe energy scales, which is supported by the observational data. We found that the invariance of the Maurer–Cartan forms with respect to the general coordinate transformation yields a single-component strong gravitational waves. The Hamiltonian dynamics of the model describes the effect of an intensive vacuum creation of gravitons and the minimal coupling scalar (Higgs) bosons in the Early Universe.
We examine the problem of the construction of a first order symmetric hyperbolic evolution system for the Einstein-Maxwell-Euler system. Our analysis is based on a 1 + 3 tetrad formalism which makes use of the components of the Weyl tensor as one of the unknowns. In order to ensure the symmetric hyperbolicity of the evolution equations implied by the Bianchi identity, we introduce a tensor of rank 3 corresponding to the covariant derivative of the Faraday tensor. Our analysis includes the case of a perfect fluid with infinite conductivity (ideal magnetohydrodynamics) as a particular subcase.
We investigate some structure scalars developed through Riemann tensor for self-gravitating cylindrically symmetric charged dissipative anisotropic fluid. We show that these scalars are directly related to the fundamental properties of the fluid. We formulate dynamical-transport equation as well as the mass function by including charge which are then expressed in terms of structure scalars. The effects of electric charge are investigated in the structure and evolution of compact objects. Finally, we show that all possible solutions of the field equations can be written in terms of these scalars.
In this paper we discuss the question how matter may emerge from space. For that purpose we consider the smoothness structure of spacetime as underlying structure for a geometrical model of matter. For a large class of compact 4-manifolds, the elliptic surfaces, one is able to apply the knot surgery of Fintushel and Stern to change the smoothness structure. The influence of this surgery to the Einstein–Hilbert action is discussed. Using the Weierstrass representation, we are able to show that the knotted torus used in knot surgery is represented by a spinor fulfilling the Dirac equation and leading to a Dirac term in the Einstein–Hilbert action. For sufficient complicated links and knots, there are “connecting tubes” (graph manifolds, torus bundles) which introduce an action term of a gauge field. Both terms are genuinely geometrical and characterized by the mean curvature of the components. We also discuss the gauge group of the theory to be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(2) × <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SU</em>(3).
We study the energy-momentum tensor for the real scalar field on the 1 + 1 dimensional non-rotating BTZ black hole. We obtain closed expressions for it.
Very recently, a new scheme to quantize the horizon area of a black hole has been proposed by Zeng and Liu et al. In this paper, we further apply the analysis to investigate area spectrum of three dimensional BTZ black hole with the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\Lambda=-1/l^{2}}\)</span> . The results show that the area spectrum and entropy spectrum are independent of the cosmological constant. The area spectrum of the black hole is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\Delta A=8\pi l_{P}^{2}}\)</span> , which confirms the initial proposal of Bekenstein that the area spectrum is independent of the black hole parameters and the spacing is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({8\pi l_{P}^{2}}\)</span> . This result also confirms the speculation of Maggiore that the periodicity of a black hole may be the origin of the area quantization. In addition, for the rotating and non-rotating BTZ black holes, we obtain the same entropy spectrum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\triangle S=2\pi}\)</span> , which is consistent with the result for other black holes. This implies that the entropy spectrum is more fundamental than the area spectrum.
From the holographic renormalization group viewpoint, while the scale transformation plays a primary role in holographic dualities by providing the extra dimension, the special conformal transformation seems to only play a secondary role. We, however, claim that the space-time diffeomorphism is crucially related to the latter. For its demonstration, we study the holographic renormalization group flow of a foliation preserving diffeomorphic theory of gravity (a.k.a. space-time flipped Horava gravity). We find that the dual field theory, if any, is only scale invariant but not conformal invariant. In particular, we show that the holographic trace anomaly in four dimension predicts the Ricci scalar squared term that would be incompatible with the Wess–Zumino consistency condition if it were conformal. This illustrates how the foliation preserving diffeomorphic theory of gravity could be in conflict with a theorem of the dual unitary quantum field theory.
The equilibrium configurations between a Schwarzschild black hole and a hyperextreme Kerr object are shown to be described by a three-parameter subfamily of the extended double-Kerr solution. For this subfamily we provide a physical representation which employs as arbitrary parameters the individual Komar masses and relative coordinate distance between the sources. The calculation of horizon’s local angular velocity induced in the Schwarzschild black hole by the Kerr constituent yields a simple expression inversely proportional to the square of the distance parameter.
This paper is a study of the effects of anisotropic matter sources on the qualitative evolution of spatially homogenous cosmologies of Bianchi type VIII. The analysis is based on a dynamical system approach and makes use of an anisotropic matter family developed by Calogero and Heinzle which generalises perfect fluids and provides a measure of deviation from isotropy. Thereby the role of perfect fluid solutions is put into a broader context. The results of this paper concern the past and future asymptotic dynamics of locally rotationally symmetric solutions of type VIII with anisotropic matter. It is shown that solutions whose matter source is sufficiently close to being isotropic exhibit the same qualitative dynamics as perfect fluid solutions. However a high degree of anisotropy of the matter model can cause dynamics to differ significantly from the vacuum and perfect fluid case.
A theoretical description of electromagnetic waves in the background of a (weak) gravitational wave is presented. Explicit expressions are obtained for the Stokes parameters during the passage of a plane-fronted gravitational wave described by the Ehlers–Kundt metric. In particular, it is shown that the axis of the polarization ellipse oscillates, its ellipticity remaining constant.
We present a calculation of the angular size of the circles in the CMB predicted by Penrose on the basis of his conformal cyclic cosmology. If these circles are detected, the existence of an upper limit on their angular radius would provide a challenge for inflation.
A hypothetical equation of motion is proposed for Kerr–Newman particles. It’s obtained by analytic continuation of the Lorentz-Dirac equation into complex space-time. A new class of “runaway” solutions are found which are similar to zitterbewegung. Electromagnetic fields generated by these motions are studied, and it’s found that the retarded (and advanced) times are multi-sheeted functions of the field points. This leads to non-uniqueness for the fields. With fixed weighting factors for these multiple roots, the solutions radiate. However, position dependent weighting factors can suppress radiation and allow non-radiating solutions. Motion with external forces are also considered, and radiation suppression is possible there too. These results are relevant for the idea that Kerr–Newman solutions provide insight into elementary particles and into emergent quantum mechanics. They illustrate a type of nascent wave-particle duality and complementarity in a purely classical field theory. Metric curvature due to gravitation is ignored.
It has been argued that the standard inflationary scenario suffers from a serious deficiency as a model for the origin of the seeds of cosmic structure: it can not truly account for the transition from an early homogeneous and isotropic stage to another one lacking such symmetries. The issue has often been thought as a standard instance of the “quantum measurement problem”, but as has been recently argued by some of us, that quagmire reaches a critical level in the cosmological context of interest here. This has lead to a proposal in which the standard paradigm is supplemented by a hypothesis concerning the self-induced dynamical collapse of the wave function, as representing the physical mechanism through which such change of symmetry is brought forth. This proposal was originally formulated within the context of semiclassical gravity. Here we investigate an alternative realization of such idea implemented directly within the standard analysis in terms of a quantum field jointly describing the inflaton and metric perturbations, the so called Mukhanov–Sasaki variable. We show that even though the prescription is quite different, the theoretical predictions include some deviations from the standard ones, which are indeed very similar to those found in the early studies. We briefly discuss the differences between the two prescriptions, at both, the conceptual and practical levels.
We develop a general method for constructing curved traversable wormholes in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, by generating surfaces of revolution around smooth curves. Application of this method to a straight line gives the usual spherically symmetric wormholes. The physics behind (2+1)-d curved traversable wormholes is discussed based on solutions to the Einstein field equations when the tidal force is zero. The Einstein field equations are found to reduce to one equation whereby the mass-energy density varies linearly with the Ricci scalar, which signifies that our (2+1)-d curved traversable wormholes are supported by dust of ordinary and exotic matter without radial tension nor lateral pressure. With this, two examples of (2+1)-d curved traversable wormholes: the helical wormhole and the catenary wormhole, are constructed and we show that there exist geodesics through them supported by non-exotic matter. This general method is applicable to our (3+1)-d spacetime.
I examine a known exact static solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations representing the exterior field of two charged masses. I find a property totally unexpected according to classical electrostatics: the electric field does not vanish between two like charges. The point where it does vanish (electrically neutral point) is found in the general case.
We investigate the distribution of gravitational energy in the spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a cosmic magnetic field. This is done in the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, which is an alternative geometrical formulation of general relativity, where gravity is described by a spacetime endowed with torsion rather than curvature, whose fundamental field variables are tetrad fields. We calculate the energy enclosed by a two-surface of constant radius—in particular, the energy enclosed by the event horizon of the black hole. In this case we find that the magnetic field has the effect of increasing the gravitational energy as compared to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We also compute the energy (i) in the weak magnetic field limit, (ii) in the limit of vanishing magnetic field, and (iii) in the absence of the black hole. In all cases our results are consistent with what should be expected on physical grounds.
The linearized form of the metric of a Finsler–Randers space is studied in relation to the equations of motion, the deviation of geodesics and the generalized Raychaudhuri equation are given for a weak gravitational field. This equation is also derived in the framework of a tangent bundle. By using Cartan or Berwald-like connections we get some types “gravito-electromagnetic” curvature. In addition we investigate the conditions under which a definite Lagrangian in a Randers space leads to Einstein field equations under the presence of electromagnetic field. Finally, some applications of the weak field in a generalized Finsler spacetime for gravitational waves are given.
A new geometric method to determine the deflection of light in the equatorial plane of the Kerr solution is presented, whose optical geometry is a surface with a Finsler metric of Randers type. Applying the Gauss–Bonnet theorem to a suitable osculating Riemannian manifold, adapted from a construction by Nazım, it is shown explicitly how the two leading terms of the asymptotic deflection angle of gravitational lensing can be found in this way.
Modified teleparallel gravity theory with the torsion scalar has recently gained a lot of attention as a possible candidate of dark energy. We perform a thorough reconstruction analysis on the so-called <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(F(T)\)</span> models, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(F(T)\)</span> is some general function of the torsion term. We derive conditions for the equivalence between of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(F(T)\)</span> models with purely kinetic k-essence. We present a new class models of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(F(T)\)</span> gravity and k-essence.
An inhomogeneous (1 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span> 1)-dimensional model of the quantum gravity is considered. It is found, that this model corresponds to a string propagating in some curved background space. The quantization scheme including the Wheeler–DeWitt equation and the “particle on a sphere” type of the gauge condition is suggested. In the quantization scheme considered, the “problem of time” is resolved by building of the quasi-Heisenberg operators acting in a space of solutions of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, and the normalization of the wave function corresponds to the Klein–Gordon type. To analyze the physical consequences of the scheme, a (1 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(+\)</span> 1)-dimensional background space is considered for which a classical solution is found and quantized. The obtained estimations show the way to solution of the cosmological constant problem for this model. Such a solution consists in compensation of the zero-point oscillations of the matter fields by the quantum oscillations of the scale factor. Along with such a compensation, a slow global evolution of a background exists that corresponds to an universe expansion.
Hamiltonian gravity, relying on arbitrary choices of ‘space,’ can obscure spacetime symmetries. We present an alternative, manifestly spacetime covariant formulation that nonetheless distinguishes between ‘spatial’ and ‘temporal’ variables. The key is viewing dynamical fields from the perspective of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">field of observers</em>—a unit timelike vector field that also transforms under local Lorentz transformations. On one hand, all fields are spacetime fields, covariant under spacetime symmeties. On the other, when the observer field is normal to a spatial foliation, the fields automatically fall into Hamiltonian form, recovering the Ashtekar formulation. We argue this provides a bridge between Ashtekar variables and covariant phase space methods. We also outline a framework where the ‘space of observers’ is fundamental, and spacetime geometry itself may be observer-dependent.
Scaling arguments are generalized to discuss the existence and the stability of static, spherically symmetric self-gravitating solitons in asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D\)</span> dimensions. The formulas obtained from the scaling arguments are applied to the Einstein–Yang–Mills solitons with higher order terms in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D=4\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(D=5\)</span> dimensions and the Einstein–Yang–Mills–Chern–Simons solitons in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(D=5\)</span> dimension. We have shown that the negative cosmological constant, in general, improves the stability of the solitons. In <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(D=4\)</span>, in fact, the negative cosmological constant is essential for the stability of the solitons. In <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(D=5\)</span>, however, the higher order terms or the Chern–Simons term play more crucial role in the stability of the solitons; the possibility of having stable solitons exists in an asymptotically flat spacetime.
In recent papers we have constructed the conformal theory of metric-torsional gravitation, and in this paper we shall include the gauge fields to study the conformal <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(U(1)\times SU(2)\)</span> Standard Model; we will show that the metric-torsional degrees of freedom give rise to a potential of conformal-gauge dynamical symmetry breaking: consequences are discussed.
In this paper, we study the quantum tunneling of non-asymptotically flat Park black hole in IR modified Hořava gravity, as well as its thermodynamical stability. In order to calculate the quantum tunneling more comprehensively, Kraus–Parikh–Wilczek method and Hamilton–Jacoby method are used together. The results show that two methods give us the same logarithmic modified entropy, namely <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(S = (\alpha - \Lambda _W) A/4\alpha + \pi /\alpha \ln A/4\)</span>. This kind of logarithmic entropy is explained well by the effect of self-gravitation in quantum tunneling picture. At tow that the thermodynamics is stable for small case (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(r_+ &lt; r_3\)</span>) and unstable for large case (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(r_+ &gt; r_3\)</span>) where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(r_3\)</span> is the critical position of Park solution, which is concordant with asymptotically flat case shown by Kehagias–Sfetsos (Phys. Lett. B 678:127, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17">2009</a></span>).
We study radiation of scalar particles from charged dilaton black holes. The Hamilton–Jacobi method has been used to work out the tunneling probability of outgoing particles from the event horizon of dilaton black holes. For this purpose we use WKB approximation to solve the charged Klein–Gordon equation. The procedure gives Hawking temperature for these black holes as well.
Experimental results published in 2004 (Ciufolini and Pavlis in Nature 431:958–960, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2004</a></span>) and 2011 (Everitt et al. in Phys Rev Lett 106:221101, 1–5, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2011</a></span>) have confirmed the frame-dragging phenomenon for a spinning earth predicted by Einstein’s field equations. Since this is observed as a precession caused by the gravitomagnetic (GM) field of the rotating body, these experiments may be viewed as measurements of a GM field. The effect is encapsulated in the classic steady state solution for the vector potential field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\zeta \)</span> of a spinning sphere–a solution applying to a sphere with angular momentum <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">J</strong> and describing a field filling space for all time (Weinberg in Gravitation and Cosmology, Wiley, New York, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7">1972</a></span>). In a laboratory setting one may visualise the case of a sphere at rest <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((\zeta =0, \text{ t}&lt;0)\)</span>, being spun up by an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">external</em> torque at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\text{ t}=0\)</span> to the angular momentum <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">J</strong>: the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\zeta \)</span> field of the textbook solution cannot establish itself instantaneously over all space at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\text{ t}=0\)</span>, but must propagate with the velocity c, implying the existence of a travelling GM wave field yielding the textbook <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\zeta \)</span> field for large enough t (Tolstoy in Int J Theor Phys 40(5):1021–1031, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">2001</a></span>). The linearized GM field equations of the post-Newtonian approximation being isomorphic with Maxwell’s equations (Braginsky et al. in Phys Rev D 15(6):2047–2060, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1977</a></span>), such GM waves are dipole waves of spin 1. It is well known that in purely gravitating systems conservation of angular momentum forbids the existence of dipole radiation (Misner et al. in Gravitation, Freeman &amp; Co., New York, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">1997</a></span>); but this rule does not prohibit the insertion of angular momentum into the system from an external source–e.g., by applying a torque to our laboratory sphere.
We studied the influence of dilaton field on the dynamical collapse of a charged scalar one. Different values of the initial amplitude of dilaton field as well as the altered values of the dilatonic coupling constant were considered. We described structures of spacetimes and properties of black holes emerging from the collapse of electrically charged scalar field in dilaton gravity. Moreover, we provided a meaningful comparison of the collapse in question with the one in Einstein gravity, when dilaton field is absent and its coupling with the scalar field is equal to zero. The course and results of the dynamical collapse process seem to be very sensitive to the amplitude of dilaton field and to the value of the coupling constant in the underlying theory.
Physical (and weak) regularity conditions are used to determine and classify all the possible types of spherically symmetric dust spacetimes in general relativity. This work unifies and completes various earlier results. The junction conditions are described for general non-comoving (and non-null) surfaces, and the limits of kinematical quantities are given on all comoving surfaces where there is Darmois matching. We show that an inhomogeneous generalisation of the Kantowski-Sachs metric may be joined to the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi metric. All the possible spacetimes are explicitly divided into four groups according to topology, including a group in which the spatial sections have the topology of a 3-torus. The recollapse conjecture (for these spacetimes) follows naturally in this approach.

This is an English translation of a paper by Hans Thirring, first published in German in 1918, which contains the first and correct presentation of the basic equations of gravitomagnetism in linear order. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for republication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal.
The present paper deals with quantization of perfect fluid anisotropic cosmological models. Bianchi type V and IX models are discussed following Schutz’s method of expressing fluid velocities in terms of six potentials. The wave functions are found for several examples of equations of state. In one case a complete wave packet could be formed analytically. The initial singularity of a zero proper volume can be avoided in this case, but it is plagued by the usual problem of non-unitarity of anisotropic quantum cosmological models. It is seen that a particular operator ordering alleviates this problem.
It is shown for a spherically symmetric black hole of general type that it is impossible to observe the infinite future of the Universe external to the hole during the finite proper time interval of the free fall. Quantitative evaluations of the effect of time dilatation for circular orbits around the Kerr black hole are obtained and it is shown that the effect is essential for ultrarelativistic energies of the rotating particle.
From a time-dependent boost-rotational symmetric vacuum solution of the Einstein Equations in five dimensions, through the Kaluza–Klein reduction the corresponding Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton solutions are obtained. The four dimensional counterpart turns out to be generalized Einstein–Rosen spacetimes representing unpolarized gravitational waves traveling in an inhomogeneous cosmology. Restricting the parameters we are able to obtain different 4D time-dependent solutions equipped with scalar and electromagnetic fields.
In the present work, we explored the effect of the radiation on the effective impact parameter for capture in a fully general relativistic manner. To summarize our results, evidently due to the radiation drag (the Poynting–Robertson effect), critical impact parameter of point particle gets larger by the factor of two, thus, the effective cross section of the luminous relativistic star becomes 4 times larger than that of the star without radiation emission. In addition, the finite size effect of the star adds up to this growth of the effective cross section.
Dark energy model with the equation of state <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p_{DE} =-\rho _{DE} -A\rho _{DE}^\alpha \)</span>, is characterised by four finite life time future singularity of the universe for different values of the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(A\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span> [Nojiri et al. in Phys Rev D 71:063004, 2005]. Since from the matter dominated era to the dark energy dominated era the ratio of the dark energy density to the matter energy density increases as the universe expand for these future singularities, the universe passes through a significant time when the dark energy density and the matter energy density are nearly comparable. Considering <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\frac{1}{r_0 }&lt;r=\frac{\rho _{DE} }{\rho _M }&lt;r_0 \)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(r_0\)</span> is any fixed ratio, we calculate the fraction of total life time of the universe when the universe passes through the coincidental stage for these singularities. It has been found that the fractional time varies as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\alpha \)</span> varies within the range for which these finite life time future singularities occur and the fraction is smaller for smaller values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(r_0 \)</span>. Importance of the fractional time and observational limits onto the values of the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(A\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\alpha \)</span> has also been discussed.
Ordinary, macroscopic systems, naturally tend to a state of maximum entropy compatible with their constraints. However, this might not hold for gravity-dominated systems since their entropy may increase without bound unless this is precluded by the formation of a black hole. In this short note we suggest, based on the Hubble expansion history, that our Universe likely behaves as an ordinary system, i.e., that its entropy seems to tend to some maximum value.
We consider a Dirac field coupled minimally to the Mielke–Baekler model of gravity and investigate cosmological solutions in three dimensions. We arrive at a family of solutions which exists even in the limit of vanishing cosmological constant.
Generalized Painlevé–Gullstrand metrics are explicitly constructed for the Kerr–Newman family of charged rotating black holes. These descriptions are free of all coordinate singularities; moreover, unlike the Doran and other proposed metrics, an extra tunable function is introduced to ensure all variables in the metrics remain real for all values of the mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M\)</span>, charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(Q\)</span>, angular momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(aM\)</span>, and cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\Lambda } &gt; -\frac{3}{a^2}\)</span>. To describe fermions in Kerr–Newman spacetimes, the stronger requirement of non-singular vierbein one-forms at the horizon(s) is imposed and coordinate singularities are eliminated by local Lorentz boosts. Other known vierbein fields of Kerr–Newman black holes are analysed and discussed; and it is revealed that some of these descriptions are actually not related by physical Lorentz transformations to the original Kerr–Newman expression in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates—which is the reason complex components appear (for certain ranges of the radial coordinate) in these metrics. As an application of our constructions the correct effective Hawking temperature for Kerr black holes is derived with the method of Parikh and Wilczek.
Late time transition is obtained with a function of Gauss Bonnet curvature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(G)\)</span> in the Einstein Hilbert action with a matter field in a FLRW spacetime assuming an ansatz without a specific <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(G)\)</span>. Late time accelerating expansion is either a phantom era without Big Rip singularity or a quintessence era or a de-Sitter era of expansion. The equation of state parameter, jerk and snap parameters support observational data and the function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(G)\)</span> obtained from the solution supports earlier works.
Using dynamical systems methods, we describe the evolution of a minimally coupled scalar field and a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker universe in the context of general relativity, which is relevant for inflation and late-time quintessence eras. Focussing on the spatially flat case, we examine the geometrical structure of the phase space, locate the equilibrium points of the system (de Sitter spaces with a constant scalar field), study their stability through both a third-order perturbation analysis and Lyapunov functions, and discuss the late-time asymptotics. As we do not specify the scalar field’s origin or its potential, the results are independent of the high-energy model.
With an aim to include the contribution of surface tension in the action of the boundary, we define the tangential pressure in terms of surface tension and Normal curvature in a more naturally geometric way. For a thin shell approximation of a static spherically symmetric surface and for weak and slowly varying fields, the negative tangential pressure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\tau _{\alpha \beta }\)</span> is chosen to be analogous to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(S_{\alpha \beta },\)</span> where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(S_{\alpha \beta }\)</span> is the classical surface tension. First, by a suitable choice of the enveloping surfaces, we show that the negative tangential pressure is independent of the four-velocity of a very thin hyper-surface. Second, using suitable definition of the normal curvature for such a surface layer, we relate the 3-pressure of a surface layer to the normal curvature and the surface tension. Third, using the fact that the tangential pressure on the surface layer is independent of the four-velocity and a central force interaction, we relate the surface tension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(S_{\alpha \beta }\)</span> to the energy of the surface layer. Four, we show that the delta like energy flows across the hypersurface will be zero for such a representation of intrinsic 3-pressure. Five, for the weak field approximation and for static spherically symmetric configuration, we deduce the classical Kelvin’s relation between surface tension, pressure difference and mean curvature from this sort of representation of negative tangential pressure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\tau _{\alpha \beta }\)</span> in terms of surface tension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(S_{\alpha \beta }\)</span> and the normal curvature. Six, using the representation of tangential pressure in terms of surface tension and normal curvature, we write a modified action for the boundary having contributions both from surface tension and normal curvature of the surface layer. Also we propose a method to find the physical action assuming a reference background, where the background is not flat. (The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(g_{\mu \nu }^{+}\)</span> or just <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(g_{\mu \nu }\)</span> has been chosen to represent the metric coefficent of the hypersurface of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(V_{+}\)</span> space which is time-like surface layer here. The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(g_{\mu \nu }^{-}\)</span> represents the metric coefficient of the space like hypersurface of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(V_{-}\)</span> space.
The weak field approximation of a model of de Sitter gauge theory of gravity is studied in two cases. Without torsion and spin current, the model cannot give the right non-relativistic approximation unless the density is a constant. With small torsion, a satisfactory Newtonian approximation can be obtained.
We construct the gauge invariant potentials of Hermitian Gravity [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span>] and derive the linearized equations of motion they obey. A comparison reveals a striking similarity to the Bardeen potentials of general relativity. We then consider the response to a point particle source, and discuss in what sense the solutions of Hermitian Gravity reduce to the Newtonian potentials. In a rather intriguing way, the Hermitian Gravity solutions exhibit a generalized reciprocity symmetry originally proposed by Born in the 1930s. Finally, we consider the trajectories of massive and massless particles under the influence of a potential. The theory correctly reproduces the Newtonian limit in three dimensions and the nonrelativistic acceleration equation. However, it differs from the light deflection calculated in linearized general relativity by 25 %. While the specific complexification of general relativity by extension to Hermitian spaces performed here does not agree with experiment, it does possess useful properties for quantization and is well-behaved around singularities as described in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span>]. Another form of complex general relativity may very well agree with experimental data.
The evolution of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields around spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by quintessence are studied with special interest on the late-time behavior. In the ring down stage of evolution, we find in the evolution picture that the fields decay more slowly due to the presence of quintessence. As the quintessence parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\epsilon \)</span> decreases, the decay of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\ell =0\)</span> mode of scalar field gives up the power-law form of decay and relaxes to a constant residual field at asymptotically late times. The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\ell &gt;0\)</span> modes of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields show a power-law decay for large values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\epsilon \)</span>, but for smaller values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\epsilon \)</span> they give way to an exponential decay.
The current early stage in the investigation of the stability of the Kerr metric is characterized by the study of appropriate model problems. Particularly interesting is the problem of the stability of the solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation, describing the propagation of a scalar field of mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mu \)</span> in the background of a rotating black hole. Rigorous results prove the stability of the reduced, by separation in the azimuth angle in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates, field for sufficiently large masses. Some, but not all, numerical investigations find instability of the reduced field for rotational parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(a\)</span> extremely close to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(1\)</span>. Among others, the paper derives a model problem for the equation which supports the instability of the field down to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(a/M \approx 0.97\)</span>.
There are strong motivations that lead cosmologists to consider alternatives to Einstein’s theory of gravity in Palatini formalism. In addition, there are two distinguishable local frames in this formalism in which one of them is local inertial frame and the equivalence principle is satisfied. Different features of speed of light such as the causal structure constant, electromagnetic and gravitational wave velocities and Einstein velocity will not coincide in this local inertial frame for extended gravity theories in Palatini formalism. On the other hand, both the measurement of time and exchange of a signal between the distant points are required to determine spatial distances. In a particular situation where these aspects of the speed of light do not coincide, the distance determination will become more demanding because light will follow a time-like geodesic of the metric. In modified gravity theories in Palatini approach, theories involve a varying speed of photon. Therefore these kinds of theories must be based on some other technique of measuring spatial distances than radar or some terms should be corrected in the line element in the proposed model. We found out we should consider a coefficient which is proportional to energy density in each era, in the line element in order to be able to use radar for measuring distance in modified gravity theories in Palatini formalism. Analysis of some observational data will be affected by considering this coefficient in the line element.
We present here a new shear free model for the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric charged body. We propose a dissipative contraction with radiation emitted outwards represented by the Vaidya–Reissner–Nordström metric. The Einstein field equations, using the junction conditions and an ansatz, are integrated numerically. A check of the energy conditions is also performed. We obtain that the charge delays the Reissner–Nordström black hole formation and it can even prevent the collapse.
In this paper, we investigate the energy conditions (including null, weak, strong, dominant) in generalized teleparallel gravities including pure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(F(T)\)</span>, teleparallel gravity with non-minimally coupled scalar field and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(F(T)\)</span> with non-minimally coupled scalar field models. In particular, we apply them to Friedmann–Robertson–Walker cosmology and obtain some corresponding results. Using two specific phenomenological forms of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(F(T)\)</span>, we show that some of the energy conditions are violated.
Exact general solutions for spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies with a nonminimally coupled ghost scalar field that has polynomial potentials of the fourth degree are obtained in the framework of the Einstein–Cartan theory (ECT) and general relativity (GR). The special values of coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\xi \)</span> and restrictions on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\xi \)</span> are found for the above solutions. Some effects of torsion and scalar field potential are elucidated. It is shown that solutions can describe the bouncing models with the late-time accelerated expansion. It is demonstrated that some models admit the unified scenario for dark matter and dark energy: (i) both singular models in ECT with a de Sitter-like asymptotic and with the power-law <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\((t^{4/3})\)</span> asymptotic at late times, (ii) singular and nonsingular models in GR with a de Sitter-like asymptotic at late times.
We investigate here the spectrum of gravitational collapse endstates when arbitrarily small perfect fluid pressures are introduced in the classic black hole formation scenario as described by Oppenheimer, Snyder and Datt (OSD) (Oppenheimer and Snyder in Phys Rev 56:455, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1939</a></span>; Datt in Zs f Phys 108:314, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1938</a></span>). This extends a previous result on tangential pressures (Joshi and Malafarina Phys Rev D 83:024009, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2011</a></span>) to the physically more realistic scenario of perfect fluid collapse. The existence of classes of pressure perturbations is shown explicitly, which has the property that injecting any smallest pressure changes the final fate of the dynamical collapse from a black hole to a naked singularity. It is therefore seen that any smallest neighborhood of the OSD model, in the space of initial data, contains collapse evolutions that go to a naked singularity outcome. This gives an intriguing insight on the nature of naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse.
The metric-affine gravity provides a useful framework for analyzing gravitational dynamics since it treats metric tensor and affine connection as fundamentally independent variables. In this work, we show that, a metric-affine gravity theory composed of the invariants formed from non-metricity, torsion and curvature tensors can be decomposed into a theory of scalar, vector and tensor fields. These fields are natural candidates for the ones needed by various cosmological and other phenomena. Indeed, we show that the model accommodates TeVeS gravity (relativistic modified gravity theory), vector inflation, and aether-like models. Detailed analyses of these and other phenomena can lead to a standard metric-affine gravity model encoding scalars, vectors and tensors.
A derivation of entropy from the expressions for two dimensional gravitation anomalies is given. Starting from the near horizon anomalous energy–momentum tensors corresponding to particular anomalies, the Virasoro algebra with central extension is obtained. The central charge is identified by comparing with the standard form of the algebra. Then the conserved charge in the ground state is computed. Finally, using the Cardy formula the entropy is obtained. Here both the vector and chiral theories are discussed.
Palatini variational principle is implemented on a five dimensional quadratic curvature gravity model, rendering two sets of equations, which can be interpreted as the field equations and the stress-energy tensor. Unification of gravity with electromagnetism and the scalar dilaton field is achieved through the Kaluza–Klein dimensional reduction mechanism. The reduced curvature invariant, field equations and the stress-energy tensor are obtained in the actual four dimensional spacetime. The structure of the interactions among the constituent fields is exhibited in detail. It is shown that the Lorentz force density naturally emerges from the reduced field equations and the equations of the standard Kaluza–Klein theory are demonstrated to be intrinsically contained in this model.
In 1996, Rovelli suggested a connection between black hole entropy and the area spectrum. Using this formalism and a theorem we prove in this paper, we briefly show the procedure to calculate the quantum corrections to the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. One can do this by two steps. First, one can calculate the “naive” black hole degeneracy without the projection constraint (in case of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(U(1)\)</span> symmetry reduced framework) or the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(SU(2)\)</span> invariant subspace constraint (in case of the fully <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(SU(2)\)</span> framework). Second, then one can impose the projection constraint or the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(SU(2)\)</span> invariant subspace constraint, obtaining logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. In this paper, we focus on the first step and show that we obtain infinite relations between the area spectrum and the naive black hole degeneracy. Promoting the naive black hole degeneracy into its approximation, we obtain the full solution to the infinite relations.
We constrain Hořava–Lifshitz gravity using the results of the OPERA and ICARUS neutrino speed experiments, which show that neutrinos are luminal particles, as found from examining the fermion propagation in the earth’s gravitational field. In particular, investigating the Dirac equation in the spherical solutions of the theory, we find that the neutrinos feel an effective metric with respect to which they might propagate superluminally. Therefore, in demanding not to have superluminal or subluminal motion we constrain the parameters of the theory. Although the excluded parameter regions are very narrow, we find that the detailed balance case lies in the excluded region.
We classify the existent Birkhoff-type theorems into four classes: first, in field theory, the theorem states the absence of helicity 0- and spin 0-parts of the gravitational field. Second, in relativistic astrophysics, it is the statement that the gravitational far-field of a spherically symmetric star carries, apart from its mass, no information about the star; therefore, a radially oscillating star has a static gravitational far-field. Third, in mathematical physics, Birkhoff’s theorem reads: up to singular exceptions of measure zero, the spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein’s vacuum field equation with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda =0\)</span> can be expressed by the Schwarzschild metric; for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \ne 0\)</span>, it is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric instead. Fourth, in differential geometry, any statement of the type: every member of a family of pseudo-Riemannian space-times has more isometries than expected from the original metric ansatz, carries the name Birkhoff-type theorem. Within the fourth of these classes we present some new results with further values of dimension and signature of the related spaces; including them are some counterexamples: families of space-times where no Birkhoff-type theorem is valid. These counterexamples further confirm the conjecture, that the Birkhoff-type theorems have their origin in the property, that the two eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor of 2-D pseudo-Riemannian spaces always coincide, a property not having an analogy in higher dimensions. Hence, Birkhoff-type theorems exist only for those physical situations which are reducible to 2-D.
In this paper we couple noncommutative vielbein gravity to scalar fields. Noncommutativity is encoded in a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\star \)</span>-product between forms, given by an abelian twist (a twist with commuting vector fields). A geometric generalization of the Seiberg–Witten map for abelian twists yields an extended theory of gravity coupled to scalars, where all fields are ordinary (commutative) fields. The vectors defining the twist can be related to the scalar fields and their derivatives, and hence acquire dynamics. Higher derivative corrections to the classical Einstein–Hilbert and Klein–Gordon actions are organized in successive powers of the noncommutativity parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\theta ^{AB}\)</span>.
We review the relation between AdS spacetime in 1 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span> 2 dimensions and the BTZ black hole (BTZbh). Later we show that a ground state in AdS spacetime becomes a thermal state in the BTZbh. We show that this is true in the bulk and in the boundary of AdS spacetime. The existence of this thermal state is tantamount to say that the Unruh effect exists in AdS spacetime and becomes the Hawking effect for an eternal BTZbh. In order to make this we use the correspondence introduced in algebraic holography between algebras of quasi-local observables associated to wedges and double cones regions in the bulk of AdS spacetime and its conformal boundary respectively. Also we give the real scalar quantum field as a concrete heuristic realization of this formalism.
The purpose of the paper is to define and study, in the presence of the electromagnetic potentials, the fifth force induced by the fifth dimension in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(4D\)</span> physics. A <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(4D\)</span> tensor calculus and the Riemannian horizontal connection on a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(5D\)</span> general Kaluza–Klein space, are the main tools in our study. We prove that the fifth force does not violate the basic concepts in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(4D\)</span> physics. Our approach is different from what is known so far in literature.
Recently, we have investigated the dynamics of the universe in tachyon cosmology with non-minimal coupling to matter (Farajollahi et al. in Mod Phys Lett A 26(15):1125–1135, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR52">2011</a></span>; Phys Lett B 711(3–4)15:225–231,<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR53">2012</a></span>; Phys Rev D 83:124042, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR54">2011</a></span>; JCAP 10:014, 2011<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR55">2011</a></span>; JCAP 05:017, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR56">2011</a></span>). In particular, for the interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), the model is studied in Farajollahi et al. (Astrophys Space Sci 336(2):461–467, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR57">2011</a></span>). In the current work, a significant observational program has been conducted to unveil the model’s thermodynamic properties. Our result shows that the IHDE version of our model better fits the observational data than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model. The first and generalized second thermodynamics laws for the universe enveloped by cosmological apparent and event horizon are revisited. From the results, both first and generalized second laws, constrained by the observational data, are satisfied on cosmological apparent horizon.In addition, the total entropy is verified with the observation only if the horizon of the universe is taken as apparent horizon. Then, due to validity of generalized second law, the current cosmic acceleration is also predicted.
We propose a generalization of Chern–Simons (CS) modified gravity in first-order formalism. CS modified gravity action has a term that comes from the chiral anomaly which is Pontryagin invariant. First-order CS modified gravity is a torsional theory and in a space-time with torsion the chiral anomaly includes a torsional topological term called Nieh-Yan invariant. We generalize the CS modified gravity by adding the Nieh-Yan term to the action and find the effective theory. We compare the generalized theory with the first-order CS modified gravity and comment on the similarities and differences.
An alternative interpretation of the conformal transformations of the metric is discussed according to which the latter can be viewed as a mapping among Riemannian and Weyl-integrable spaces. A novel aspect of the conformal transformation’s issue is then revealed: these transformations relate complementary geometrical pictures of a same physical reality, so that, the question about which is the physical conformal frame, does not arise. In addition, arguments are given which point out that, unless a clear statement of what is understood by “equivalence of frames” is made, the issue is a semantic one. For definiteness, an intuitively “natural” statement of conformal equivalence is given, which is associated with conformal invariance of the field equations. Under this particular reading, equivalence can take place only if the metric is defined up to a conformal equivalence class. A concrete example of a conformal-invariant theory of gravity is then explored. Since Brans–Dicke theory is not conformally invariant, then the Jordan’s and Einstein’s frames of the theory are not equivalent. Otherwise, in view of the alternative approach proposed here, these frames represent complementary geometrical descriptions of a same phenomenon. The different points of view existing in the literature are critically scrutinized on the light of the new arguments.
We investigate the matching, across cylindrical surfaces, of static cylindrically symmetric conformally flat spacetimes with a cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>, satisfying regularity conditions at the axis, to an exterior Linet–Tian spacetime. We prove that for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \le 0\)</span> such matching is impossible. On the other hand, we show through simple examples that the matching is possible for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span>. We suggest a physical argument that might explain these results.
To explore possibilities of avoiding coincidence problem in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)\)</span> gravity we consider models in Einstein conformal frame which are equivalent to Einstein gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field. As the conformal factor determines the coupling term and hence the interaction between matter and dark energy, the function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(R)\)</span> can in principle be determined by choosing an appropriate function for the deceleration parameter only. Possible behavior of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R)\)</span> to avoid coincidence problem are investigated in two such cases.
A construction of conservation laws and conserved quantities for perturbations in arbitrary metric theories of gravity is developed. In an arbitrary field theory, with the use of incorporating an auxiliary metric into the initial Lagrangian covariantized Nœther identities are carried out. Identically conserved currents with corresponding superpotentials are united into a family. Such a generalized formalism of the covariantized identities gives a natural basis for constructing conserved quantities for perturbations. A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new family</em> of conserved currents and correspondent superpotentials for perturbations on arbitrary curved backgrounds in metric theories is suggested. The conserved quantities are both of pure canonical Nœther and of Belinfante corrected types. To test the results each of the superpotentials of the family is applied to calculate the mass of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole in the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity. Using all the superpotentials of the family gives the standard accepted mass.
We present a noncommutative (NC) version of the action for vielbein gravity coupled to gauge fields. Noncommutativity is encoded in a twisted <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\star \)</span>-product between forms, with a set of commuting background vector fields defining the (abelian) twist. A first order action for the gauge fields avoids the use of the Hodge dual. The NC action is invariant under diffeomorphisms and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\star \)</span>-gauge transformations. The Seiberg–Witten map, adapted to our geometric setting and generalized for an arbitrary abelian twist, allows to re-express the NC action in terms of classical fields: the result is a deformed action, invariant under diffeomorphisms and usual gauge transformations. This deformed action is a particular higher derivative extension of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to Yang-Mills fields, and to the background vector fields defining the twist. Here noncommutativity of the original NC action dictates the precise form of this extension. We explicitly compute the first order correction in the NC parameter of the deformed action, and find that it is proportional to cubic products of the gauge field strength and to the symmetric anomaly tensor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(D_{IJK}\)</span>.
The canonical decomposition of a Lorentz algebra element into a sum of orthogonal simple (decomposable) Lorentz bivectors is defined and discussed. This decomposition on the Lie algebra level leads to a natural decomposition of a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation into a product of commuting Lorentz transformations, each of which is the exponential of a simple bivector. While this later result is known, we present novel formulas that are independent of the form of the Lorentz metric chosen. As an application of our methods, we obtain an alternative method of deriving the formulas for the exponential and logarithm for Lorentz transformations.
We consider the bound-state energy levels of a spin-1/2 fermion in the gravitational field of a near-black hole object. In the limit that the metric of the body becomes singular, all binding energies tend to the rest-mass energy (i.e. total energy approaches zero). We present calculations of the ground state energy for three specific interior metrics (Florides, Soffel and Schwarzschild) for which the spectrum collapses and becomes quasi-continuous in the singular metric limit. The lack of zero or negative energy states prior to this limit being reached prevents particle pair production occurring. Therefore, in contrast to the Coulomb case, no pairs are produced in the non-singular static metric. For the Florides and Soffel metrics the singularity occurs in the black hole limit, while for the Schwarzschild interior metric it corresponds to infinite pressure at the centre. The behaviour of the energy level spectrum is discussed in the context of the semi-classical approximation and using general properties of the metric.
A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is quantized by the action variable and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule in this paper. We find that the spectra of the horizon area and the entropy are evenly spaced. The black hole mass is also quantized and it’s spectrum spacing is proportional inversely to the mass. The ground state appears and has a constant entropy <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\pi k_B\)</span>. The ground state mass is shown to be the black hole remnant predicted by the generalized uncertainty principle and may be a candidate of dark matter.
Increasingly accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background and the large scale distribution of galaxies necessitate the study of nonlinear perturbations of Friedmann–Lemaitre cosmologies, whose equations are notoriously complicated. In this paper we present a new derivation of the governing equations for second order perturbations within the framework of the metric-based approach that is minimal, as regards amount of calculation and length of expressions, and flexible, as regards choice of gauge and stress–energy tensor. Because of their generality and the simplicity of their structure our equations provide a convenient starting point for determining the behaviour of nonlinear perturbations of FL cosmologies with any given stress–energy content, using either the Poisson gauge or the uniform curvature gauge.
The Lagrangian derivation of the Equations of Motion for topological static spherically symmetric metrics in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal{F }(R,G)\)</span>-modified gravity is presented and the related solutions are discussed. In particular, a new topological solution for the model <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathcal{F }(R,G)=R+\sqrt{G}\)</span> is found. The black hole solutions and the First Law of thermodynamic are analyzed. Furthermore, the coupling with electromagnetic field is also considered and a Maxwell solution is derived.
Weak field approximate solutions in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \rightarrow 0\)</span> limit of a model of de Sitter gravity have been presented in the static and spherically symmetric case. Although the model looks different from general relativity, among those solutions, there still exist the weak Schwarzschild fields with the smooth connection to regular internal solutions obeying the Newtonian gravitational law. The existence of such solutions would determine the value of the coupling constant, which is different from that of the previous literature. Moreover, there also exist solutions that could deduce the galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter.
The kinematical nature of the spectral shift in different types of spacetime, cosmological redshift and frequency shift in Schwarzschild spacetime being the most prominent representatives, has been a subject of recent interest. We demonstrate that the kinematical nature of the spectral shift is an inherent feature of the particular type of spacetimes. The general solution is found: necessary and sufficient conditions for the spectral shift arising from a kinematical origin are formulated. The status of the relative speed is discussed.
The Bañados et al. (Phys Rev Lett 69:1849, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1992</a></span>) solution corresponding to the exterior space-time of a black hole in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((2+1)\)</span> dimensions has been found to be very useful to understand various aspects relating to the gravitational field of a black hole. We present here a class of interior solutions corresponding to the BTZ exterior by making use of a model presented by Finch and Skea (Class Quantum Grav 6:467, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1989</a></span>) which was earlier found to be relevant for the description realistic stars in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\((3+1)\)</span> dimensions. We show physical viability of the model in lower dimensions as well.
We study higher-derivative gravity theories in arbitrary space–time dimension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(d\)</span> with a cosmological constant at their maximally critical points where the masses of all linearized perturbations vanish. These theories have been conjectured to be dual to logarithmic conformal field theories in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((d-1)\)</span>-dimensional boundary of an AdS solution. We determine the structure of the linearized perturbations and their boundary fall-off behaviour. The linearized modes exhibit the expected Jordan block structure and their inner products are shown to be those of a non-unitary theory. We demonstrate the existence of consistent unitary truncations of the polycritical gravity theory at the linearized level for odd rank.
The construction of the conformal scalar propagator which has been obtained in the preceding two projects as an analytic function of the Schwarzschild black-hole space-time is completed with a boundary condition imposed by the physical context through contour integration in the exterior vicinity of the event horizon. It is shown that, as a consequence of the semi-classical character which the emitted quanta have in that exterior vicinity, the particle production by the Schwarzschild black hole which was formally established in the preceding project is identical to thermal Hawking radiation. By extension, it is established that such a particle production corresponds to a spectrum which detracts from thermality by the amount predicted by Parikh and Wilczek if energy conservation is properly imposed as a constraint on scalar propagation. The results obtained herein support the case made by Hawking on the relation between quantum propagation and observation of particles produced by a black hole.
The effects implied for the structure of compact objects by the modification of General Relativity (GR) produced by the generalization of the Lagrangian density to the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)=R+\alpha R^2\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R\)</span> is the Ricci curvature scalar, have been recently explored. It seems likely that this <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">squared</em>-gravity may allow heavier Neutron Stars (NSs) than GR. In addition, these objects can be useful to constrain free parameters of modified-gravity theories. The differences between alternative gravity theories are enhanced in the strong gravitational regime. In this regime, because of the complexity of the field equations, perturbative methods become a good choice to treat the problem. Following previous works in the field, we performed a numerical integration of the structure equations that describe NSs in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R)\)</span>-gravity, recovering their mass-radius relations, but focusing on particular features that arise from this approach in the profiles of the NS interior. We show that these profiles run in correlation with the second-order derivative of the analytic approximation to the Equation of State (EoS), which leads to regions where the enclosed mass decreases with the radius in a counter-intuitive way. We reproduce all computations with a simple polytropic EoS to separate zeroth-order modified gravity effects.
It is well known that the classification of the Weyl tensor in Lorentzian manifolds of dimension four, the so called Petrov classification, was a great tool to the development of general relativity. Using the bivector approach it is shown in this article a classification for the Weyl tensor in all four-dimensional manifolds, including all signatures and the complex case, in an unified and simple way. The important Petrov classification then emerges just as a particular case in this scheme. The boost weight classification is also extended here to all signatures as well to complex manifolds. For the Weyl tensor in four dimensions it is established that this last approach produces a classification equivalent to the one generated by the bivector method.
We study a nonminimal derivative coupling (NMDC) of scalar field, where the scalar field is coupled to curvature tensor in the five dimensional universal extra dimension model. We apply the Einstein equation and find its solution. First, we consider a special case of pure free scalar field without NMDC and we find that for static extradimension, the solution is equivalent to the standard cosmology with stiff matter. For a general case of pure free scalar field with NMDC, we find that the de Sitter solution is the solution of our model. For this solution, the scalar field evolves linearly in time. In the limit of small Hubble parameter, the general case give us the same solution as in the pure free scalar field. Finally, we perform a dynamical analysis to determine the stability of our model. We find that the extradimension, if it exist, can not be static and always shrinks with the expansion of four dimensional spacetime.
An obvious strategy to escape from a stable circular orbit in the Schwarzschild spacetime is to employ a tangential instantaneous acceleration. Using the theory of optimal rocket trajectories in general relativity, recently developed in Henriques and Natário (J Optim Theory Appl 154:500–552; <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2011</a></span>), we show that this manoeuvre satisfies the optimality conditions for maximizing the rocket’s final energy (given a fixed amount of fuel) if and only if the magnitude of the acceleration is smaller than a certain bound. This is the general relativistic version of a result by Lawden (J Brit Interplan Soc 12:68–71; <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1953</a></span>).
A particular class of space-time, with a tachyon field, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\phi \)</span>, and a barotropic fluid constituting the matter content, is considered herein as a model for gravitational collapse. For simplicity, the tachyon potential is assumed to be of inverse square form i.e., <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(V(\phi )\sim \phi ^{-2}\)</span>. Our purpose, by making use of the specific kinematical features of the tachyon, which are rather different from a standard scalar field, is to establish the several types of asymptotic behavior that our matter content induces. Employing a dynamical system analysis, complemented by a thorough numerical study, we find classical solutions corresponding to a naked singularity or a black hole formation. In particular, there is a subset where the fluid and tachyon participate in an interesting tracking behaviour, depending sensitively on the initial conditions for the energy densities of the tachyon field and barotropic fluid. Two other classes of solutions are present, corresponding respectively, to either a tachyon or a barotropic fluid regime. Which of these emerges as dominant, will depend on the choice of the barotropic parameter, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\gamma \)</span>. Furthermore, these collapsing scenarios both have as final state the formation of a black hole.
The electrostatic potential generated by a point charge at rest in a simple static, spherically symmetric wormhole is given in the form of series of multipoles and in closed form. The general potential which is physically acceptable depends on a constant due to the fact that the monopole solution is arbitrary. When the wormhole has <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(Z_2\)</span>-symmetry, the potential is completely determined. The calculation of the electrostatic self-energy and of the self-force is performed in all cases considered.
Based on the ideas of adiabatic invariant quantity, we attempt to quantize the entropy of a charged black hole in de Sitter spacetime in two different coordinates. The entropy spectrum is obtained by imposing Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule and the laws of black hole thermodynamics to the modified adiabatic covariant action of the charged black hole. The result shows that the spacing of entropy spectrum is equidistant, and the corresponding horizon area quantum is identical to Bekenstein’s result. Interestingly, in contrast to the quasinormal mode analysis, we note that there is no need to impose the small charge limit for the obtained entropy spectrum of the charged black hole. We also note that the modified adiabatic covariant action gives the same value for the black hole entropy spectrum in different coordinate frames. This is a physically desired result since the entropy spectrum should be invariant under the coordinate transformations.
We develop a general setting for the quantization of linear bosonic and fermionic field theories subject to local gauge invariance and show how standard examples such as linearised Yang-Mills theory and linearised general relativity fit into this framework. Our construction always leads to a well-defined and gauge-invariant quantum field algebra, the centre and representations of this algebra, however, have to be analysed on a case-by-case basis. We discuss an example of a fermionic gauge field theory where the necessary conditions for the existence of Hilbert space representations are not met on any spacetime. On the other hand, we prove that these conditions are met for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in linearised pure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(N=1\)</span> supergravity on certain spacetimes, including asymptotically flat spacetimes and classes of spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces. We also present an explicit example of a supergravity background on which the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field can not be consistently quantized.
We explore the problem of time in quantum gravity in a point-particle analogue model of scale-invariant gravity. If quantized after reduction to true degrees of freedom, it leads to a time-independent Schrödinger equation. As with the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, time disappears, and a frozen formalism that gives a static wavefunction on the space of possible shapes of the system is obtained. However, if one follows the Dirac procedure and quantizes by imposing constraints, the potential that ensures scale invariance gives rise to a conformal anomaly, and the scale invariance is broken. A behaviour closely analogous to renormalization-group (RG) flow results. The wavefunction acquires a dependence on the scale parameter of the RG flow. We interpret this as time evolution and obtain a novel solution of the problem of time in quantum gravity. We apply the general procedure to the three-body problem, showing how to fix a natural initial value condition, introducing the notion of complexity. We recover a time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a repulsive cosmological force in the ‘late-time’ physics and we analyse the role of the scale invariant Planck constant. We suggest that several mechanisms presented in this model could be exploited in more general contexts.
In this paper we explore stochastical and statistical properties of so-called recurring spike induced Kasner sequences. Such sequences arise in recurring spike formation, which is needed together with the more familiar BKL scenario to yield a complete description of generic spacelike singularities. In particular we derive a probability distribution for recurring spike induced Kasner sequences, complementing similar available BKL results, which makes comparisons possible. As examples of applications, we derive results for so-called large and small curvature phases and the Hubble-normalized Weyl scalar.
We investigate a class of cosmological solutions of Einstein’s field equations in higher dimensions with a cosmological constant and an ideal fluid matter distribution as a source. We discuss the dynamical evolution of the universe subject to two constraints that (i) the total volume scale factor of the universe is constant and (ii) the effective energy density is constant. We obtain various interesting new dynamics for the external space that yield a time varying deceleration parameter including oscillating cases when the flat/curved external and curved/flat internal spaces are considered. We also comment on how the universe would be conceived by an observer in four dimensions who is unaware of the extra dimensions.
For near horizon geometry we examine the linearized equations around extremal Kerr horizon (which is a unique axially symmetric near horizon geometry) and give some arguments towards stability of this horizon with respect to generic (non-symmetric) linear perturbation of near horizon geometry. The result is also applicable for other situations like Kundt’s class spacetimes or isolated horizons.
We show that the path of any accelerated body in an arbitrary spacetime geometry <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(g_{\mu \nu }\)</span> can be described as a geodesic in a dragged metric <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\hat{q}_{\mu \nu }\)</span> that depends only on the background metric and on the motion of the body. Such procedure allows the interpretation of all kinds of non-gravitational force as modifications of the spacetime metric. This method of effective elimination of the forces by changing the metric of the substratum can be understood as a generalization of the d’Alembert principle applied to all relativistic processes.
The dynamical behaviors of FRW Universe containing a posivive/negative potential scalar field in loop quantum cosmology scenario are discussed. The method of the phase-plane analysis is used to investigate the stability of the Universe. It is found that the stability properties in this situation are quite different from the classical cosmology case. For a positive potential scalar field coupled with a barotropic fluid, the cosmological autonomous system has five fixed points and one of them is stable if the adiabatic index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\gamma \)</span> satisfies <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(0&lt;\gamma &lt;2\)</span>. This leads to the fact that the universe just have one bounce point instead of the singularity which lies in the quantum dominated area and it is caused by the quantum geometry effect. There are four fixed points if one considers a scalar field with a negative potential, but none of them is stable. Therefore, the universe has two kinds of bounce points, one is caused by the quantum geometry effect and the other is caused by the negative potential, the Universe may enter a classical re-collapse after the quantum bounce. This hints that the spatially flat FRW Universe containing a negative potential scalar field is cyclic.
In this paper, we first generalize the formulation of entropic gravity to (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n+1\)</span>)-dimensional spacetime and derive Newton’s law of gravity and Friedmann equation in arbitrary dimensions. Then, we extend the discussion to higher order gravity theories and propose an entropic origin for Gauss–Bonnet gravity and more general Lovelock gravity in arbitrary dimensions. As a result, we are able to derive Newton’s law of gravitation as well as the corresponding Friedmann equations in these gravity theories. This procedure naturally leads to a derivation of the higher dimensional gravitational coupling constant of Friedmann/Einstein equation which is in complete agreement with the results obtained by comparing the weak field limit of Einstein equation with Poisson equation in higher dimensions. Our strategy is to start from first principles and assuming the entropy associated with the apparent horizon given by the expression previously known via black hole thermodynamics, but replacing the horizon radius <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r_+\)</span> with the apparent horizon radius <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(R\)</span>. Our study shows that the approach presented here is powerful enough to derive the gravitational field equations in any gravity theory and further supports the viability of Verlinde’s proposal.
Hawking radiation spectrum via fermions tunneling is investigated through horizon radii of Plebański-Demiański family of black holes. To this end, we determine the tunneling probabilities for outgoing and incoming charged fermion particles and obtain their corresponding Hawking temperatures. The graphical behavior of Hawking temperatures and horizon radii (cosmological and event horizons) is also studied. We find consistent results with those already available in literature.
We present a high-order scheme for solving the full non-linear Einstein equations on characteristic null hypersurfaces using the framework established by Bondi and Sachs. This formalism allows asymptotically flat spaces to be represented on a finite, compactified grid, and is thus ideal for far-field studies of gravitational radiation. We have designed an algorithm based on 4th-order radial integration and finite differencing, and a spectral representation of angular components. Consequently the scheme offers more accuracy at a given computational cost compared to previous methods which are second-order accurate. Based on a newly implemented code, we show that the new numerical scheme remains stable and is convergent at the expected order of accuracy.
A number of scalar invariant characterizations of the Kerr solution are presented. These characterizations come in the form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quality factors</em> defined in stationary space-times. A quality factor is a scalar quantity varying in the interval <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\([0,1]\)</span> with the value 1 being attained if and only if the space-time is locally isometric to the Kerr solution. No knowledge of the Kerr solution is required to compute these quality factors. A number of different possibilities arise depending on whether the space-time is Ricci-flat and asymptotically flat, just Ricci-flat, or Ricci non-flat. In each situation a number of quality factors are constructed and analysed. The relevance of these quality factors is clear in any situation where one seeks a rigorous formulation of the statement that a space-time is “close” to the Kerr solution, such as: its non-linear stability problem, the asymptotic settlement of a radiating isolated system undergoing gravitational collapse, or in the formulation of some uniqueness results.

We consider static spherically symmetric Lovelock black holes and generalize the dimensionally continued black holes in such a way that they asymptotically for large <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r\)</span> go over to the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in dS/AdS spacetime. This means that the master algebraic polynomial is not degenerate but instead its derivative is degenerate. This family of solutions contains an interesting class of pure Lovelock black holes which are the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(N\)</span>th order Lovelock <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda \)</span>-vacuum solutions having the remarkable property that their thermodynamical parameters have the universal character in terms of the event horizon radius. This is in fact a characterizing property of pure Lovelock theories. We also demonstrate the universality of the asymptotic Einstein limit for the Lovelock black holes in general.
The case of asymptotic Minkowskian space-times is considered. A special class of asymptotic rectilinear coordinates at the spatial infinity, related to a specific system of free falling observers, is chosen. This choice is applied in particular to the Schwarzschild metric, obtaining a vanishing energy for this space-time. This result is compared with the result of some known theorems on the uniqueness of the energy of any asymptotic Minkowskian space, showing that there is no contradiction between both results, the differences becoming from the use of coordinates with different operational meanings. The suitability of Gauss coordinates when defining an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic</em> energy is considered and it is finally concluded that a Schwarzschild metric is a particular case of space-times with vanishing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic</em> 4-momenta.
We show that plane-fronted gravitational waves induce the breaking of parallelograms in space-time, in the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. The breaking of parallelograms can be shown by considering a thought experiment that consists of a simple physical configuration, similar to the experimental setup that is expected to lead to the measurement of gravitational waves with the use of laser interferometers. An incident beam of light splits into two beams running along perpendicular arms, endowed with fixed mirrors at the extremes. The reflected light beams are detected at the same point of the splitting. Along each arm, the two light beams define two null vectors: the forward vector and the reflected vector. We show that the sum of these four vectors, the forward and reflected null vectors along the two arms, do form a parallelogram in flat space-time, but not in the presence of plane-fronted gravitational waves. The non-closure of the parallelogram is a manifestation of the torsion of the space-time, and in this context indicates the existence of gravitational waves.
Point-like masses on a given initial domain of the complex plane are interacting globally under gravity and as a consequence the initial domain is mapped into a final domain which encodes all effects of localized sources . The mapping between the two domains is a truncated beta function which so far has not been fully investigated. In this paper we propose to know more about the final domain and so we start from the remark that when the masses are put on the real axis of the upper half plane, the mapping in question is the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping (SCM), a popular and useful tool in computational geometry. The linking of planar gravity with the SCM will allow us to use all what we know from this mapping to get answer for certain static solutions in planar gravity. Among the problems we will study we mention: masses distributed on the real axis of the full complex plane, masses distributed on a circle, the dust string either closed or infinite open. Strings with tensions are however not linked to SCM as these mappings do not involve the concept of tension.
We study the path integral formulation of Friedmann universe filled with a massless scalar field in loop quantum cosmology. All the isotropic models of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(k=0,+1,-1\)</span> are considered. To construct the path integrals in the timeless framework, a multiple group-averaging approach is proposed. Meanwhile, since the transition amplitude in the deparameterized framework can be expressed in terms of group-averaging, the path integrals can be formulated for both deparameterized and timeless frameworks. Their relation is clarified. It turns out that the effective Hamiltonian derived from the path integral in deparameterized framework is equivalent to the effective Hamiltonian constraint derived from the path integral in timeless framework, since they lead to same equations of motion. Moreover, the effective Hamiltonian constraints of above models derived in canonical theory are confirmed by the path integral formulation.
A class of cosmological solutions of higher dimensional Einstein field equations with the energy-momentum tensor of a homogeneous, isotropic fluid as the source are considered with an anisotropic metric that includes the direct sum of a 3-dimensional (physical, flat) external space metric and an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(n\)</span>-dimensional (compact, flat) internal space metric. A simple kinematical constraint is postulated that correlates the expansion rates of the external and internal spaces in terms of a real parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\lambda \)</span>. A specific solution for which both the external and internal spaces expand at different rates is given analytically for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(n=3\)</span>. Assuming that the internal dimensions were at Planck length scales when the external space starts with a Big Bang (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(t=0\)</span>), they expand only 1.49 times and stay at Planck length scales even in the present age of the universe (13.7 Gyr). The effective four dimensional universe would exhibit a behavior consistent with our current understanding of the observed universe. It would start in a stiff fluid dominated phase and evolve through radiation dominated and pressureless matter dominated phases, eventually going into a de Sitter phase at late times.
The effects of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) on the inflationary dynamics and the thermodynamics of the early universe are studied. Using the GUP approach, the tensorial and scalar density fluctuations in the inflation era are evaluated and compared with the standard case. We find a good agreement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. Assuming that a quantum gas of scalar particles is confined within a thin layer near the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe which satisfies the boundary condition, the number and entropy densities and the free energy arising form the quantum states are calculated using the GUP approach. A qualitative estimation for effects of the quantum gravity on all these thermodynamic quantities is introduced.
We consider a complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and to a U(1) gauge symmetry and we construct of a first order symmetric hyperbolic evolution system for the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system. Our analysis is based on a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+3\)</span> tetrad formalism which makes use of the components of the Weyl tensor as one of the unknowns. In order to ensure the symmetric hyperbolicity of the evolution equations, implied by the Bianchi identity, we introduce a tensor of rank 3 corresponding to the covariant derivative of the Faraday tensor, and two tensors of rank 2 for the covariant derivative of the vector potential and the scalar field.
In this paper, within the scope of FRW cosmology for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(k=0, \pm 1\)</span>, we investigate the dynamics of the universe in cosmological model where a scalar field nonminimally is coupled to matter field. By best-fitting the model parameters with the observational data, for the direct interaction between the dark sectors in the model, we obtain new constraints on cosmological parameters. The result with the best fitted model parameters supports the current universe acceleration in all models and shows that only in flat universe case the phantom crossing occurs twice in the past and once in the future. The best fitted reconstructed potential function and other physical functions are also obtained.
We consider the Cartan extension of Riemann geometry as the basis upon which to build the Sciama–Kibble completion of Einstein gravity, developing the most general theory in which torsion and metric have two independent coupling constants: the main problem of the ESK theory was that torsion, having the Newton constant, was negligible beyond the Planck scale, but in this <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathrm {ESK}^{2}\)</span> theory torsion, with its own coupling constant, may be relevant much further Planck scales; further consequences of these torsionally-induced interactions will eventually be discussed.
We analyse in detail the thermodynamics in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles of a class of non-asymptotically flat black holes of the Einstein-(anti) Maxwell-(anti) Dilaton theory in 4D with spherical symmetry. We present the first law of thermodynamics, the thermodynamic analysis of the system through the geometrothermodynamics methods, Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Liu–Lu–Luo–Shao and the most common, that made by the specific heat. The geometric methods show a curvature scalar identically zero, which is incompatible with the results of the analysis made by the non null specific heat, which shows that the system is thermodynamically interacting, does not possess extreme case nor phase transition. We also analyse the local and global stability of the thermodynamic system, and obtain a local and global stability for the normal case for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(0&lt;\gamma &lt;1\)</span> and for other values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\gamma \)</span>, an unstable system. The solution where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\gamma =0\)</span> separates the class of locally and globally stable solutions from the unstable ones.
We study the classical and quantum models of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology in the framework of the gravity theory proposed by Hořava, the so-called Hořava–Lifshitz theory of gravity. Beginning with the ADM representation of the action corresponding to this model, we construct the Lagrangian in terms of the minisuperspace variables and show that in comparison with the usual Einstein-Hilbert gravity, there are some correction terms coming from the Hořava theory. Either in the matter free or in the case when the considered universe is filled with a perfect fluid, the exact solutions to the classical field equations are obtained for the flat, closed and open FRW model and some discussions about their possible singularities are presented. We then deal with the quantization of the model in the context of the Wheeler–DeWitt approach of quantum cosmology to find the cosmological wave function. We use the resulting wave functions to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects.
We study the action for the three-space formalism of general relativity, better known as the Barbour–Foster–Ó Murchadha action, which is a square-root Baierlein–Sharp–Wheeler action. In particular, we explore the (pre)symplectic structure by pulling it back via a Legendre map to the tangent bundle of the configuration space of this action. With it we attain the canonical Lagrangian vector field which generates the gauge transformations (3-diffeomorphisms) and the true physical evolution of the system. This vector field encapsulates all the dynamics of the system. We also discuss briefly the observables and perennials for this theory. We then present a symplectic reduction of the constrained phase space.
It is well known that the canonical quantization of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) filled with a perfect fluid leads to nonsingular universes which, for later times, behave as their classical counterpart. This means that the expectation value of the scale factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\left&lt;a\right&gt;(t)\)</span> never vanishes and, as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(t\rightarrow \infty \)</span>, we recover the classical expression for the scale factor. In this paper, we show that such universes can be reproduced by classical cosmology given that the universe is filled with an exotic matter. In the case of a perfect fluid, we find an implicit equation of state (EoS). We then show that this single fluid with an implict EoS is equivalent to two non-interacting fluids, one of them representing stiff matter with negative energy density. In the case of two non-interacting scalar fields, one of them of the phantom type, we find their potential energy. In both cases we find that quantum mechanics changes completely the configuration of matter for small values of time, by adding a fluid or a scalar field with negative energy density. As time passes, the density of negative energy decreases and we recover the ordinary content of the classical universe. The more the initial wave function of the universe is concentrated around the classical big bang singularity, the more it is necessary to add negative energy, since this type of energy will be responsible for the removal of the classical singularity.
In previous work, the numerical solution of the linearized gravitational field equations near space-like and null-infinity was discussed in the form of the spin-2 zero-rest-mass equation for the perturbations of the conformal Weyl curvature. The motivation was to study the behavior of the field and properties of the numerical evolution of the system near infinity using Friedrich’s conformal representation of space-like infinity as a cylinder. It has been pointed out by H.O. Kreiss and others that the numerical evolution of a system using second order wave equations has several advantages compared to a system of first order equations. Therefore, in the present paper we derive a system of second order wave equations and prove that the solution spaces of the two systems are the same if appropriate initial and boundary data are given. We study the properties of this system of coupled wave equations in the same geometric setting and discuss the differences between the two approaches.
In this paper, the structure formation theories for the modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) model are established in the linear and non-linear regimes. Concretely, for the linear regime, the evolutions of the growth index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f\)</span> and the growth variable <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(T\)</span> are illustrated for the interacting MCG (IMCG) model and MCG model without interaction between dark energy and dark matter, which can give reasonable predictions for structure formation. While for the non-linear regime, by supposing the homogeneity and conservation of dark energy when the system reaches virialization, we can point out that MCG reaches the state of turn around later than GCG, the value of the collapse factor in MCG model is bigger than the fiducial value 0.5 in Einstein-de Sitter universe, namely <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\eta &gt;0.5\)</span>, because of the effective repulsive force of dark energy, and the density contrast of the virialization tends to the Einstein-de Sitter value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(18\pi ^{2}\)</span>. Furthermore, the evolutions of the cluster number counts in LCDM, GCG and MCG models without and with interaction between dark energy and dark matter are illustrated by extending the Press-Schechter framework, which can exhibit the differences among the three models.
An infinite class of interior solutions for the Curzon vacuum metric, discovered by Marek, is investigated. It is found that physical plausibility imposes conditions on the minimum size of the source, similar to those familiar from the static spherically symmetric case.
The Goldberg–Sachs theorem is generalized for all four-dimensional manifolds endowed with torsion-free connection compatible with the metric, the treatment includes all signatures as well as complex manifolds. It is shown that when the Weyl tensor is algebraically special severe geometric restrictions are imposed. In particular it is demonstrated that the simple self-dual eigenbivectors of the Weyl tensor generate integrable isotropic planes. Another result obtained here is that if the self-dual part of the Weyl tensor vanishes in a Ricci-flat manifold of (2,2) signature the manifold must be Calabi–Yau or symplectic and admits a solution for the source-free Einstein–Maxwell equations.
We use analytic perturbation theory to present a new approximate metric for a rigidly rotating perfect fluid source with equation of state (EOS) <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\epsilon +(1-n)p=\epsilon _0\)</span>. This EOS includes the interesting cases of strange matter, constant density and the fluid of the Wahlquist metric. It is fully matched to its approximate asymptotically flat exterior using Lichnerowicz junction conditions and it is shown to be a totally general matching using Darmois–Israel conditions and properties of the harmonic coordinates. Then we analyse the Petrov type of the interior metric and show first that, in accordance with previous results, in the case corresponding to Wahlquist’s metric it can not be matched to the asymptotically flat exterior. Next, that this kind of interior can only be of Petrov types I, D or (in the static case) O and also that the non-static constant density case can only be of type I. Finally, we check that it can not be a source of Kerr’s metric.



Nonlinear perturbations of Friedmann–Lemaitre cosmologies with dust and a cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span> have recently attracted considerable attention. In this paper our first goal is to compare the evolution of the first and second order perturbations by determining their asymptotic behaviour at late times in ever-expanding models. We show that in the presence of spatial curvature <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> or a cosmological constant, the density perturbation approaches a finite limit both to first and second order, but the rate of approach depends on the model, being power law in the scale factor if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span> but logarithmic if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda =0\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(K&lt;0\)</span>. Scalar perturbations in general contain a growing and a decaying mode. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span> the decaying mode does not die away, i.e. it contributes on an equal footing as the growing mode to the asymptotic expression for the density perturbation. On the other hand, the future asymptotic regime of the Einstein–de Sitter universe (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(K=\Lambda =0\)</span>) is completely different, as exemplified by the density perturbation which diverges; moreover, the second order perturbation diverges <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">faster</em> than the first order perturbation, which suggests that the Einstein–de Sitter universe is unstable to perturbations, and that the perturbation series do not converge towards the future. We conclude that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the presence of spatial curvature or a cosmological constant stabilizes the perturbations</em>. Our second goal is to derive an explicit expression for the second order density perturbation that can be used to study the effects of including a cosmological constant and spatial curvature.
We compare an approximation of the singularity-free Wahlquist exact solution with a stationary and axisymmetric metric for a rigidly rotating perfect fluid with the equation of state <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mu +3p=\mu _0\)</span>, a sub-case of a global approximate metric obtained recently by some of us. We see that to have a fluid with vanishing twist vector everywhere in Wahlquist’s metric the only option is to let its parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r_0\rightarrow 0\)</span> and using this in the comparison allows us in particular to determine the approximate relation between the angular velocity of the fluid in a set of harmonic coordinates and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(r_0\)</span>. Through some coordinate changes we manage to make every component of both approximate metrics equal. In this situation, the free constants of our metric take values that happen to be those needed for it to be of Petrov type D, the last condition that this fluid must verify to give rise to the Wahlquist solution.
It is known that a smooth LTB model cannot have a positive apparent central acceleration. Using a local Taylor expansion method we study the low-redshift conditions to obtain an apparent negative deceleration parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(q^{app}(z)\)</span> derived from the luminosity distance <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D_L(z)\)</span> for a central observer in a LTB space, confirming that central smoothness implies a positive central deceleration. Since observational data is only available at redshift greater than zero we find the critical values of the parameters defining a centrally smooth LTB model which give a positive apparent acceleration at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(z&gt;0\)</span>, providing a graphical representation of the conditions in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(q_0^{app},q_1^{app}\)</span> plane, which are respectively the zero and first order terms of the central Taylor expansion of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(q^{app}(z)\)</span>. We finally derive a coordinate independent expression for the apparent deceleration parameter based on the expansion of the relevant functions in red-shift rather than in the radial coordinate. We calculate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(q^{app}(z)\)</span> with two different methods to solve the null geodesic equations, one based on a local central expansion of the solution in terms of cosmic time and the other one using the exact analytical solution in terms of generalized conformal time.
In an effort to contribute to a better understanding of General Relativity, here we lay the foundations of generalized Newtonian gravity, which unifies inertial forces and gravitational fields. We also formulate a kind of equivalence principle for this generalized Newtonian theory. Finally, we prove that the theory we propose here can be obtained as the non-relativistic limit of General Relativity.
We present a new class of exact solutions of relativistic field equations for a collapsing spherically symmetric shear-free isotopic fluid undergoing radial heat flow. The interior solutions are matched with Vaidya exterior metric over the boundary. Initially the interior solutions represent a static configuration of perfect fluid which then gradually starts evolving into radiating collapse.
We consider a non-minimal coupling of a perfect fluid matter system with geometry, which the coupling function is taken to be an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. Due to such a coupling, the matter stress tensor is no longer conserved and there is an energy transfer between the two components. By solving the conservation equation and applying the second law of thermodynamics, we show that direction of the energy transfer depends on the equation of state of the matter fluid. In particular, a phantom fluid should loose energy with expansion of the universe. This energy reduction can avoid the universe to end with a cosmic doomsday.
We consider the self-force on a static charge in the long throat of a wormhole. The example of the self-force calculation in the specific profile of the wormhole throat are given. We demonstrate that the self-force is repulsive in the considered case.
We reformulate the general theory of relativity in the language of Riemann–Cartan geometry. We start from the assumption that the space-time can be described as a non-Riemannian manifold, which, in addition to the metric field, is endowed with torsion. In this new framework, the gravitational field is represented not only by the metric, but also by the torsion, which is completely determined by a geometric scalar field. We show that in this formulation general relativity has a new kind of invariance, whose invariance group consists of a set of conformal and gauge transformations, called Cartan transformations. These involve both the metric tensor and the torsion vector field, and are similar to the well known Weyl gauge transformations. By making use of the concept of Cartan gauges, we show that, under Cartan transformations, the new formalism leads to different pictures of the same gravitational phenomena. We illustrate this fact by looking at the one of the classical tests of general relativity theory, namely the gravitational spectral shift. Finally, we extend the concept of space-time symmetry to Riemann–Cartan space-times with scalar torsion and obtain the conservation laws for auto-parallel motions in a static spherically symmetric vacuum space-time in a Cartan gauge, whose orbits are identical to Schwarzschild orbits in general relativity.
We study the thermodynamics and geometrothermodynamics of different black hole configurations in more than four spacetime dimensions. We use the response functions to find the conditions under which second order phase transitions occur in higher-dimensional static Reissner–Nordström and stationary Kerr black holes. Our results indicate that the equilibrium manifold of all these black hole configurations is in general curved and that curvature singularities appear exactly at those places where second order phase transitions occur.

This is an English translation of a paper by Georges Lemaître, first published in French in 1927, in which the author, having re-discovered and generalised the Friedmann models, for the first time related them to the then-already-available observations of expansion of the Universe. The translation published in 1931 in MNRAS was not perfectly faithful to the original text—it was updated. As it turned out very recently, the updates were done by Lemaître himself, but the discrepancies between the two texts caused a temporary stir among historians. Our translation follows the 1927 version exactly. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for republication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Jean-Pierre Luminet that, among other things, lists and explains the differences between the 1927 and 1931 versions.

In this introduction to the causal set approach to the problem of quantum gravity, I emphasise that causal sets are both fundamentally discrete and Lorentz invariant, which makes them nonlocal. I focus on opportunities for phenomenology arising from and stimulated by causal sets.
This is a review of recent progress concerning generic spacelike singularities in general relativity. For brevity the main focus is on singularities in vacuum spacetimes, although the connection with, and the role of, matter for generic singularity formation is also commented on. The paper describes recent developments in two areas and show how these are connected within the context of the conformally Hubble-normalized state space approach. The first area is oscillatory singularities in spatially homogeneous cosmology and the connection between asymptotic behaviour and heteroclinic chains. The second area concerns oscillatory singularities in inhomogeneous models, especially spike chains and recurring spikes. The review also outlines some underlying reasons for why the structures that are the foundation for generic oscillatory behaviour exists at all, which entails discussing how underlying physical principles and applications of solution generating techniques yield hierarchical structures and connections between them. Finally, it is pointed out that recent progress concerning generic singularities motivates some speculations that suggest that a paradigm shift concerning their physical role, and what mathematical issues to address, might be in order.
The area spectra of extreme Kerr and nearly extreme Kerr–Newmann black holes are investigated from quasinormal modes via Maggiore’s physical interpretation of quasinormal modes. Using the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the action variable quantization, we arrive at consistent equally spaced area and entropy spectra. Results show that the spectra are irrelevant to the parameters of the black holes and the perturbation fields, which fully agree with Bekensteins original conjecture. In the calculations, we have defined the corresponding Hawking temperatures of the black holes following the suggestion of Mäkelä et al. to avoid the zero temperature and to guarantee the (nearly-) extreme black holes quantizable.
Using measurements of geodetic precession from Gravity Probe B, we constrain possible departures from Einstein’s General Relativity for a spinning test body in Kaluza–Klein gravity with one additional space dimension. We consider the two known static and spherically symmetric solutions of the 5D field equations (the soliton and canonical metrics) and obtain new limits on the free parameters associated with each. The theory is consistent with observation but must be “close to 4D” in both cases.
In this note, we review the canonical analysis of the Holst action in the time gauge, with a special emphasis on the Hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixation of the Lagrange multipliers. This enables us to identify at the Hamiltonian level the various components of the covariant torsion tensor, which have to be vanishing in order for the classical theory not to depend upon the Barbero–Immirzi parameter. We also introduce a formulation of three-dimensional gravity with an explicit phase space dependency on the Barbero–Immirzi parameter as a potential way to investigate its fate and relevance in the quantum theory.
The Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule is useful to study the area spectrum of black holes by employing adiabatic invariants. This method is extended to charged dilaton black holes in 2<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span>1 dimensions. We put the background space-time into the Kruskal-like coordinate to find the period with respect to Euclidian time. Also assuming that the adiabatic invariant obeys Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule, detailed study of area and entropy spectrum has been done. It is dependent on the charge and is equally spaced as well. We also investigate the thermodynamics of the charged dilaton black hole.
InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)\)</span>-theories of gravity are reviewed in the framework of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. The asymmetry is generated by the gravitational coupling of heavy (Majorana) neutrinos with the Ricci scalar curvature. In order that the mechanism works, a time varying non-zero Ricci curvature is necessary. The latter is provided by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(R)\)</span> cosmology, whose Lagrangian density is of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\mathcal{L}(R)\sim f(R)\)</span>, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(f(R)\sim R+\alpha R^n\)</span>.
This work focuses on an unexplored aspect of non-symmetric geometry where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">only</em> the off-diagonal metric components along the extra dimension, in a 5-dimensional spacetime, are non-symmetric. We show that the energy densities of the stationary non-symmetric models are similar to that of brane models thereby mimicking the thick-brane scenario. We find that the massive test particles are confined near the location of the brane for both growing and decaying warp factors. This feature is unique to the non-symmetric nature of our model. We have also studied the dynamical models where standard 4D FLRW brane is embedded. Our analysis shows that the non-symmetric terms deconfine energy density at the early universe while automatically confine at late times.
The problem of structure formation in relativistic dissipative fluids was analyzed in a previous work within Eckart’s framework, in which the heat flux is coupled to the hydrodynamic acceleration, additional to the usual temperature gradient term. It was shown that in such case, the pathological behavior of fluctuations leads to the disappearance of the gravitational instability responsible for structure formation (Mondragon-Suarez and Sandoval-Villalbazo in Gen Relativ Gravit 44:139–145, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8">2012</a></span>). In the present work the problem is revisited using a constitutive equation derived from relativistic kinetic theory. This new relation, in which the heat flux is not coupled to the hydrodynamic acceleration, leads to a consistent first order in the gradients formalism. In this case the gravitational instability remains, and only relativistic corrections to the Jeans wave number are obtained. In the calculation here shown the non-relativistic limit is recovered, opposite to what happens in Eckart’s case (Hiscock and Lindblom in Phys Rev D 31:725–733, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1985</a></span>).
We study various derivations of Hawking radiation in conformally rescaled metrics. We focus on two important properties, the location of the horizon under a conformal transformation and its associated temperature. We find that the production of Hawking radiation cannot be associated in all cases to a trapping horizon because its location is not invariant under a conformal transformation. We also find evidence that the temperature of the Hawking radiation should transform simply under a conformal transformation, being invariant for asymptotic observers in the limit that the conformal transformation factor is unity at their location.
A method based on the path integral approach is engaged to consider the gravitational emission from a quantum mechanical bound system in a locally inertial frame. In such a frame, interaction between the electromagnetic (bound potential) and gravitational fields can be neglected resulting in the less mathematical complexity. The final outcome is in agreement with the previous result for the radiation intensity of emitted gravitons due to decay of bound states in TT gauge.
In this contribution, we study the Dirac oscillator under the influence of noninertial effects of a rotating frame in the cosmic string spacetime. We show that both noninertial effects and the topology of the cosmic string spacetime restrict the physical region of the spacetime where the quantum particle can be placed, and discuss two different cases of bound states solutions of the Dirac equation by analysing the behaviour of the Dirac oscillator frequency.
It is well known that the Schwarzschild solution describes the gravitational field outside compact spherically symmetric mass distribution in General Relativity. In particular, it describes the gravitational field outside a point particle. Nevertheless, what is the exact solution of Einstein’s equations with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\delta \)</span>-type source corresponding to a point particle is not known. In the present paper, we prove that the Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates is the asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein’s equations with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\delta \)</span>-type energy-momentum tensor corresponding to a point particle. Solution of Einstein’s equations is understood in the generalized sense after integration with a test function. Metric components are locally integrable functions for which nonlinear Einstein’s equations are mathematically defined. The Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates is locally isometric to the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates but differs essentially globally. It is topologically trivial neglecting the world line of a point particle. Gravity attraction at large distances is replaced by repulsion at the particle neighborhood.
We investigate the area spectrum of Kehagias–Sfetsos black hole in Hořava–Lifshitz gravity via modified adiabatic invariant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(I=\oint p_i d q_i\)</span> and Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule. We find that the area spectrum is equally spaced with a spacing of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\( \Delta A=4 \pi l_p ^2\)</span>. We have also studied the thermodynamic behavior of KS black hole by deriving different thermodynamic quantities.
A non-diagonal spherically symmetric tetrad field, involving four unknown functions of radial coordinate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r\)</span>, is applied to the equations of motion of f(T) gravity theory. A special exact vacuum solution with one constant of integration is obtained. The scalar torsion related to this special solution vanishes. To understand the physical meaning of the constant of integration we calculate the energy associated with this solution and show how it is related to the gravitational mass of the system.
We perform a general study of the thermodynamic properties of static electrically charged black hole solutions of nonlinear electrodynamics minimally coupled to gravitation in three space dimensions. The Lagrangian densities governing the dynamics of these models in flat space are defined as arbitrary functions of the gauge field invariants, constrained by some requirements for physical admissibility. The exhaustive classification of these theories in flat space, in terms of the behaviour of the Lagrangian densities in vacuum and on the boundary of their domain of definition, defines twelve families of admissible models. When these models are coupled to gravity, the flat space classification leads to a complete characterization of the associated sets of gravitating electrostatic spherically symmetric solutions by their central and asymptotic behaviours. We focus on nine of these families, which support asymptotically Schwarzschild-like black hole configurations, for which the thermodynamic analysis is possible and pertinent. In this way, the thermodynamic laws are extended to the sets of black hole solutions of these families, for which the generic behaviours of the relevant state variables are classified and thoroughly analyzed in terms of the aforementioned boundary properties of the Lagrangians. Moreover, we find universal scaling laws (which hold and are the same for all the black hole solutions of models belonging to any of the nine families) running the thermodynamic variables with the electric charge and the horizon radius. These scale transformations form a one-parameter multiplicative group, leading to universal “renormalization group”-like first-order differential equations. The beams of characteristics of these equations generate the full set of black hole states associated to any of these gravitating nonlinear electrodynamics. Moreover the application of the scaling laws allows to find a universal finite relation between the thermodynamic variables, which is seen as a generalized Smarr law. Some particular well known (and also other new) models are analyzed as illustrative examples of these procedures.
The Einstein–Maxwell equations with anisotropic pressures and electromagnetic field are studied with a polytropic equation of state. New exact solutions to the field equations are generated in terms of elementary functions. Special cases of the uncharged solutions of Feroze and Siddiqui (Gen Relativ Gravit 43:1025, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24">2011</a></span>) and Maharaj and Mafa Takisa (Gen Relativ Gravit 44:1419, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25">2012</a></span>) are recovered. We also obtain exact solutions for a neutral anisotropic gravitating body for a polytrope from our general treatment. Graphical plots indicate that the energy density, tangential pressure and anisotropy profiles are consistent with earlier treatments which suggest relevance in describing relativistic compact stars.
We investigate the effect of backreaction due to inhomogeneities on the evolution of the present universe by considering a two-scale model within the Buchert framework. Taking the observed present acceleration of the universe as an essential input, we study the effect of inhomogeneities in the future evolution. We find that the backreaction from inhomogeneities causes the acceleration to slow down in the future for a range of initial configurations and model parameters. The present acceleration ensures formation of the cosmic event horizon, and our analysis brings out how the effect of the event horizon could further curtail the global acceleration, and even lead in certain cases to the emergence of a future decelerating epoch.
We revisit the gauge issue in cosmological perturbation theory, and highlight its relation to the notion of covariance in general relativity. We also discuss the similarities and differences of the covariant approach in perturbation theory to the Bardeen or metric approach in a non-technical fashion.
Conformally related metrics and Lagrangians are considered in the context of scalar–tensor gravity cosmology. After the discussion of the problem, we pose a lemma in which we show that the field equations of two conformally related Lagrangians are also conformally related if and only if the corresponding Hamiltonian vanishes. Then we prove that to every non-minimally coupled scalar field, we may associate a unique minimally coupled scalar field in a conformally related space with an appropriate potential. The latter result implies that the field equations of a non-minimally coupled scalar field are the same at the conformal level with the field equations of the minimally coupled scalar field. This fact is relevant in order to select physical variables among conformally equivalent systems. Finally, we find that the above propositions can be extended to a general Riemannian space of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n\)</span>-dimensions.
In this paper, an interacting dark energy model in a non-flat universe is studied, with taking interaction form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(C=\alpha H\rho _{de}\)</span>. And in this study a property for the mysterious dark energy is aforehand assumed, i.e. its equation of state <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(w_{\Lambda }=-1\)</span>. After several derivations, a power-law form of dark energy density is obtained <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\rho _{\Lambda } \propto a^{-\alpha }\)</span>, here <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(a\)</span> is the cosmic scale factor, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\alpha \)</span> is a constant parameter introducing to describe the interaction strength and the evolution of dark energy. By comparing with the current cosmic observations, the combined constraints on the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\alpha \)</span> is investigated in a non-flat universe. For the used data they include: the Union2 data of type Ia supernova, the Hubble data at different redshifts including several new published datapoints, the baryon acoustic oscillation data, the cosmic microwave background data, and the observational data from cluster X-ray gas mass fraction. The constraint results on model parameters are <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Omega _{K}=0.0024\,(\pm 0.0053)^{+0.0052+0.0105}_{-0.0052-0.0103}, \alpha =-0.030\,(\pm 0.042)^{+0.041+0.079}_{-0.042-0.085}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\Omega _{0m}=0.282\,(\pm 0.011)^{+0.011+0.023}_{-0.011-0.022}\)</span>. According to the constraint results, it is shown that small constraint values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\alpha \)</span> indicate that the strength of interaction is weak, and at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(1\sigma \)</span> confidence level the non-interacting cosmological constant model can not be excluded.
Recently, a generalized gravity theory was proposed by Harko et al. where the Lagrangian density is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar R and the trace of the stress-energy tensor T, known as F(R,T) gravity. In their derivation of the field equations, they have not considered conservation of the stress-energy tensor. In the present work, we have shown that a part of the arbitrary function f(R,T) can be determined if we take into account of the conservation of stress-energy tensor, although the form of the field equations remain similar. For homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe the field equations are solved and corresponding cosmological aspects has been discussed. Finally, we have studied the energy conditions in this modified gravity theory both generally and a particular case of perfect fluid with constant equation of state.
In this paper, we study the properties of the charged black hole surrounded by the quintessence. The solution space for the horizons for various values of the mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M\)</span>, charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(Q\)</span>, and the quintessence parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span> are studied in detail. Special focus in given to the degenerate horizons: we obtain cold, ultracold and Nariai black holes which has similar topologies as for the Reissner–Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes. We also study the lukewarm black hole with the quintessence in this paper.


Black holes are the elementary particles of gravity, the final state of sufficiently massive stars and of energetic collisions. With a 40-year long history, black hole physics is a fully-blossomed field which promises to embrace several branches of theoretical physics. Here I review the main developments in highly dynamical black holes with an emphasis on high energy black hole collisions and probes of particle physics via superradiance. This write-up, rather than being a collection of well known results, is intended to highlight open issues and the most intriguing results.
The inverse scattering method of Belinsky and Zakharov is a powerful method to construct solutions of vacuum Einstein equations. In particular, in five dimensions this method has been successfully applied to construct a large variety of black hole solutions. Recent applications of this method to Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory, for the special case of Kaluza–Klein dilaton coupling, has led to the construction of the most general black ring in this theory. In this contribution, we review the inverse scattering method and its application to the EMd theory. We illustrate the efficiency of these methods with a detailed construction of an electrically charged black ring.
The relation between the expanding universe and local vacuum solutions, such as that for the Solar System, is crucially mediated by Birkhoff’s theorem. Here we consider how that relation works, and give generalizations of Birkhoff’s theorem when there are geometric and matter and perturbations. The issue of to what degree dark matter might influence the solar system emerges as a significant question.
The Einstein–Straus model consists of a Schwarzschild spherical vacuole in a Friedman–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) dust spacetime (with or without <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>). It constitutes the most widely accepted model to answer the question of the influence of large scale (cosmological) dynamics on local systems. The conclusion drawn by the model is that there is no influence from the cosmic background, since the spherical vacuole is static. Spherical generalizations to other interior matter models are commonly used in the construction of lumpy inhomogeneous cosmological models. On the other hand, the model has proven to be reluctant to admit non-spherical generalizations. In this review, we summarize the known uniqueness results for this model. These seem to indicate that the only reasonable and realistic non-spherical deformations of the Einstein–Straus model require perturbing the FLRW background. We review results about linear perturbations of the Einstein–Straus model, where the perturbations in the vacuole are assumed to be stationary and axially symmetric so as to describe regions (voids in particular) in which the matter has reached an equilibrium regime.
Hypersurfaces of arbitrary causal character embedded in a spacetime are studied with the aim of extracting necessary and sufficient free data on the submanifold suitable for reconstructing the spacetime metric and its first derivative along the hypersurface. The constraint equations for hypersurfaces of arbitrary causal character are then computed explicitly in terms of this hypersurface data, thus providing a framework capable of unifying, and extending, the standard constraint equations in the spacelike and in the characteristic cases to the general situation. This may have interesting applications in well-posedness problems more general than those already treated in the literature. As a simple application of the constraint equations for general hypersurfaces, we derive the field equations for shells of matter when no restriction whatsoever on the causal character of the shell is imposed.
We establish the connection between the standard ADM 3+1 treatment of matter with its characteristic equivalent, in the context of spherical symmetry. The flux-conservative rendition of the fluid equations are obtained. Considering adiabatic distributions of perfect fluid, we evolve the system using the so-called post-quasi-static approximation in radiation coordinates. We obtain an adiabatic matter evolution in the quasi-static regime or slow motion, which is not shear-free nor geodesic.
For a two-dimensional black hole we determine the quasinormal frequencies of the Klein–Gordon and Dirac fields. In contrast to the well known examples whose spectrum of quasinormal frequencies is discrete, for this black hole we find a continuous spectrum of quasinormal frequencies, but there are unstable quasinormal modes. In the framework of the Hod and Maggiore proposals we also discuss the consequences of these results on the form of the entropy spectrum for the two-dimensional black hole.
We consider a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D\)</span> dimensional Kasner type diagonal spacetime where metric functions depend only on a single coordinate and electromagnetic field shares the symmetries of spacetime. These solutions can describe static cylindrical or cosmological Einstein–Maxwell vacuum spacetimes. We mainly focus on electrovacuum solutions and four different types of solutions are obtained in which one of them has no four dimensional counterpart. We also consider the properties of the general solution corresponding to the exterior field of a charged line mass and discuss its several properties. Although it resembles the same form with four dimensional one, there is a difference on the range of the solutions for fixed signs of the parameters. General magnetic field vacuum solution are also briefly discussed, which reduces to Bonnor-Melvin magnetic universe for a special choice of the parameters. The Kasner forms of the general solution are also presented for the cylindrical or cosmological cases.
In this paper we present a new point of view on space–time–matter (STM) theory. First, some weak points from earlier research papers on STM theory are presented. Then, we obtain in a covariant form the fully general <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(4D\)</span> equations of motion for STM theory. This enables us to classify the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(5D\)</span> motions and to give a new definition of the fifth force in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(4D\)</span> physics.
Based on the new point of view on space–time–matter theory developed in our paper (Bejancu, Gen Rel Grav, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2013</a></span>), we obtain the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(4D\)</span> Einstein equations in a general <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(5D\)</span> Kaluza–Klein space with electromagnetic potentials. In particular, we recover the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(4D\)</span> Einstein equations obtained by Wesson and Ponce de Leon (J Math Phys 33:3883, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16">1992</a></span>) in case the electromagnetic potentials vanish identically on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\bar{M}\)</span>. The Riemannian horizontal connection and the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(4D\)</span> tensor calculus on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(\bar{M}\)</span>, are the main tools in the study.
We obtain a new phantom black plane solution in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(4\)</span>D of the Einstein–Maxwell theory coupled with a cosmological constant. We analyse their basic properties, as well as its causal structure, and obtain the extensive and intensive thermodynamic variables, as well as the specific heat and the first law. Through the specific heat and the so-called geometric methods, we analyse in detail their thermodynamic properties, the extreme and phase transition limits, as well as the local and global stabilities of the system. The normal case is shown with an extreme limit and the phantom one with a phase transition only for null mass, which is physically inaccessible. The systems present local and global stabilities for certain values of the entropy density with respect to the electric charge, for the canonical and grand canonical ensembles.
The total mass, the Witten type gauge conditions and the spectral properties of the Sen–Witten and the 3-surface twistor operators in closed universes are investigated. It has been proven that a recently suggested expression <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathtt{M}\)</span> for the total mass density of closed universes is vanishing if and only if the spacetime is flat with toroidal spatial topology; it coincides with the first eigenvalue of the Sen–Witten operator; and it is vanishing if and only if Witten’s gauge condition admits a non-trivial solution. Here we generalize slightly the result above on the zero-mass configurations: <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathtt{M}=0\)</span> if and only if the spacetime is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">holonomically trivial</em> with toroidal spatial topology. Also, we show that the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the (square of the) Sen–Witten operator is even, and a potentially viable gauge condition is suggested. The monotonicity properties of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathtt{M}\)</span> through the examples of closed Bianchi I and IX cosmological spacetimes are also discussed. A potential spectral characterization of these cosmological spacetimes, in terms of the spectrum of the Riemannian Dirac operator and the Sen–Witten and the 3-surface twistor operators, is also indicated.
We establish a Penrose-like inequality for general (not necessarily time-symmetric) initial data sets of the Einstein–Maxwell equations, which satisfy the dominant energy condition. More precisely, it is shown that the ADM energy is bounded below by an expression which is proportional to the sum of the square root of the area of the outermost future (or past) apparent horizon and the square of the total charge. The proportionality constants depend on the solution to a linear elliptic equation which incorporates the charge. In addition, a corrected version of the Penrose-like inequality (Commun Math Phys 290(2):779–788, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14">2009</a></span>) is presented.
The mysterious attractive constant radial force acted in the past on Pioneer spacecrafts—the so-called Pioneer anomaly—is considered within the context of Rindler acceleration. As an idea this is tempting since it is reminiscent of the cosmological constant. Fortunately the anomalous force acts radially toward the sun so that it differs from the mission of a cosmological constant. Without resorting to the physical source responsible for such a term we investigate the modified Schwarzschild geodesics. The Rindler acceleration naturally affects all massive / massless particle orbits. Stable orbits may turn unstable and vice versa with a finely-tuned acceleration parameter. The overall role of the extra term, given its attractive feature is to provide confinement in the radial geodesics.
We derive the rotating black hole metric by appealing to ellipsoidal symmetry of space and a general guiding principle of incorporation of the Newtonian acceleration for massive and no acceleration for massless particles.
We study dynamical wormhole solutions in the framework of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(T)\)</span> theory of gravity with anisotropic fluid. We assume a general dynamical spherically symmetric wormhole spacetime with specific form of the shape function and scale factor. The scale factor is taken in the power-law form in order to meet the accelerated expansion of the universe. We discuss the behavior of energy conditions for three particular choices of equation of state, i.e., radial and transverse pressures in linear form with energy density and traceless fluid. The energy conditions satisfy for certain time intervals in all cases. The radial coordinate does not play any role in graphs and the validity or violation of energy conditions depend upon the time coordinate only. The graphical behavior of the energy conditions become equivalent for radial and transverse pressures in all the three cases.
Here we study the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in the tunneling formalism for Hawking radiation to evaluate the quantum-corrected Hawking temperature and entropy for a Schwarzschild black hole. We compare our results with the existing results given by other candidate theories of quantum gravity. In the entropy-area relation we found some new correction terms and in the leading order we found a term which varies as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sim \sqrt{Area}\)</span>. We also get the well known logarithmic correction in the sub-leading order. We discuss the significance of this new quantum corrected leading order term.
We review recent results concerning the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system with positive cosmological constant. We do so by comparing with the classical results of Christodoulou concerning the asymptotically flat case (vanishing cosmological constant) and by discussing some of the issues which have emerged since the publication of our main results. Concerning the positive cosmological constant case, we also sketch an alternative proof of global in (Bondi) time existence, based on energy estimates, which is presumably more flexible and, consequently, amenable to generalizations; other potential improvements and generalizations of our main results are also discussed.
We study the modes of evolution of massless scalar fields in the asymptotically AdS spacetime surrounding maximally symmetric black holes of large and intermediate size in the Lovelock model. It is observed that all modes are purely damped at higher orders. Also, the rate of damping is seen to be independent of order at higher dimensions. The asymptotic form of these frequencies for the case of large black holes is found analytically. Finally, the area spectrum for such black holes is found from these asymptotic modes.
General Relativistic calculations in the linear regime have been made for electromagnetic beams of radiation known as optical vortices. These exotic beams of light carry a physical quantity known as optical orbital angular momentum. It is found that when a massive spinning neutral particle is placed along the optical axis, a phenomenon known as inertial frame dragging occurs. Our results are compared with those found previously for a ring laser and an order of magnitude estimate of the laser intensity needed for a precession frequency of 1 Hz is given for these “steady” beams of light.
We present an exponential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(F(R)\)</span> modified gravity model in the Jordan and the Einstein frame. We use a general approach in order to investigate and demonstrate the viability of the model. Apart from the general features that this model has, which actually render it viable at a first step, we address the issues of finite time singularities, Newton’s law corrections and the scalaron mass. As we will evince, the model passes these latter two tests successfully and also has no finite time singularities, a feature inherent to other well studied exponential models.
We consider the minimally coupled Klein-Gordon equation for a charged, massive scalar field in the non-extremal Reissner-Nordström background. Performing a frequency domain analysis, using a continued fraction method, we compute the frequencies <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\omega \)</span> for quasi-bound states. We observe that, as the extremal limit for both the background and the field is approached, the real part of the quasi-bound states frequencies <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal{R }(\omega )\)</span> tends to the mass of the field and the imaginary part <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal{I }(\omega )\)</span> tends to zero, for any angular momentum quantum number <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\ell \)</span>. The limiting frequencies in this double extremal limit are shown to correspond to a distribution of extremal scalar particles, at stationary positions, in no-force equilibrium configurations with the background. Thus, generically, these stationary scalar configurations are regular at the event horizon. If, on the other hand, the distribution contains scalar particles at the horizon, the configuration becomes irregular therein, in agreement with no hair theorems for the corresponding Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system.
We investigate the massive graviton stability of the BTZ black hole obtained from three dimensional massive gravities which are classified into the parity-even and parity-odd gravity theories. In the parity-even gravity theory, we perform the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(s\)</span>-mode stability analysis by using the BTZ black string perturbations, which gives two Schrödinger equations with frequency-dependent potentials. The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(s\)</span>-mode stability is consistent with the generalized Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for spin-2 field. It seems that for the parity-odd massive gravity theory, the BTZ black hole is stable when the imaginary part of quasinormal frequencies of massive graviton is negative. However, this condition is not consistent with the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(s\)</span>-mode stability based on the second-order equation obtained after squaring the first-order equation. Finally, we explore the black hole stability connection between the parity-odd and parity-even massive gravity theories.
The existing observational data on possible variations of fundamental physical constants (FPC) confirm more or less confidently only a variability of the fine structure constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\alpha \)</span> in space and time. A model construction method is described, where variations of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha \)</span> and other FPCs (including the gravitational constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(G\)</span>) follow from the dynamics of extra space-time dimensions in the framework of curvature-nonlinear multidimensional theories of gravity. An advantage of this method is a unified approach to variations of different FPCs. A particular model explaining the observable variations of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\alpha \)</span> in space and time has been constructed. It comprises a FRW cosmology with accelerated expansion, perturbed due to slightly inhomogeneous initial data.
The central smoothness of the functions defining a LTB solution plays a crucial role in their ability to mimic the effects of the cosmological constant. Even if non-smoothness is not physically inconsistent with the theory of general relativity, smoothness is still an important geometrical property characterizing the solution of the Einstein’s equations. So far attention has been focused on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(C^{1}\)</span> models while in this paper we approach it in a more general way, investigating the implications of higher order central smoothness conditions for LTB models reproducing the luminosity distance of a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda CDM\)</span> Universe. Our analysis is based on a low red-shift expansion, and extends previous investigations by including also the constraint coming from the age of the Universe and re-expressing the equations for the solution of the inversion problem in a manifestly dimensionless form which makes evident the freedom to accommodate any value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(H_0\)</span> as well. Higher order smoothness conditions strongly limit the number of possible solutions respect to the first order condition. Neither a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(C^{1}\)</span> or a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(C^{i}\)</span> LTB model can both satisfy the age constraint and mimic the cosmological constant for the luminosity distance. This implies that it is not necessary to include any additional observable to distinguish mathematically the theoretical predictions of a smooth LTB model from a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Lambda CDM\)</span>. One difference is in the case in which the age constraint is not included and the bang function is zero, in which there is a unique solution for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(C^1\)</span> models but no solution for the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(C^{i}\)</span> case. Another difference is in the case in which the age constraint is not included and the bang function is not zero, in which the solution is undetermined for both <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(C^1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(C^{i}\)</span> models, but the latter ones have much less residual parametric freedom. Our results imply that any LTB model able to fit luminosity distance data and satisfy the age constraint is either not mimicking exactly the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\Lambda CDM\)</span> red-shift space theoretical predictions or it is not smooth.
A coordinate system that blockwise-simplifies the Kerr–Newman black hole’s thermodynamical state space Ruppeiner metric geometry is constructed, with discussion of the limiting cases corresponding to simpler black holes. It is deduced that one of the three conformal Killing vectors of the Reissner–Nordström and Kerr cases (whose thermodynamical state space metrics are 2 by 2 and conformally flat) survives generalization to the Kerr–Newman case’s 3 by 3 thermodynamical state space metric.
The thermodynamics of Maxwell-Dilaton black holes has been extensively studied. It has served as a fertile ground to test ideas about temperature through various definitions of surface gravity. In this paper, we make an independent analysis of this black hole solution in both, Einstein and Jordan, frames. We explore a set of definitions for the surface gravity and observe the different predictions they make for the near extremal configuration of this black hole. Finally, motivated by the singularity structure in the interior of the event horizon, we use a holographic argument to remove the micro-states from the disconnected region of this solution. In this manner, we construct a frame independent entropy from which we obtain a temperature which agrees with the standard results in the non-extremal regime, and has a desirable behaviour around the extremal configurations according to the third law of black hole mechanics.
We present a new Hamiltonian formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) meant to serve as the departure point for canonical quantization of the theory. TEGR is considered here as a theory of a cotetrad field on a spacetime. The Hamiltonian formulation is derived by means of an ADM-like <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(3+1\)</span> decomposition of the field and without any gauge fixing. A complete set of constraints on the phase space and their algebra are presented. The formulation is described in terms of differential forms.
Equatorial circular orbits of test particles in the Kerr–anti-de Sitter black-hole and naked-singularity spacetimes are analyzed and their properties like the existence, orientation and stability are discussed. Due to the attractive cosmological constant (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varLambda &lt;0\)</span>), all particles moving along equatorial orbits are still bound in the gravitational field of the central object. In general, there are two families of equatorial circular orbits. Particles moving along minus-family orbits possess negative angular momentum and, thus, they are counterrotating from the point of view of the locally non-rotating frames (LNRF). Particles moving along plus-family orbits possess, in most cases, positive angular momentum and belong to corotating particles from the point of view of the LNRF. Nevertheless, in stationary regions inside black holes and also near naked singularities with appropriately chosen value of the cosmological constant and rotational parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(a&lt;1.299\)</span>, there are also counterrotating plus-family circular orbits. Moreover, in spacetimes with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(a&lt;1.089\)</span>, some of these orbits are characterized by negative specific energy, indicating the bounding energy of the particle, moving along such an orbit, higher than its rest energy. In black-hole spacetimes, all such orbits are radially unstable, but in naked-singularity spacetimes, stable counterrotating orbits with negative specific energy exist.
We show that, for the scalar field cosmology with exponential potential, the set of values of the coupling parameter for which the solutions undergo a transient period of acceleration (TPA) is much larger than the set discussed in the literature. The gradual inclusion of ordinary and dark matters results in an everywhere, but near the origin, smoother and right shifted (along the time axis) acceleration curve. For the 3-fluid problem, the energy density need not exhibit a plateau during the acceleration period. Much excess in the dark matter and/or ordinary matter energy densities would lead the universe to undergo an eternal deceleration expansion. For the 3-fluid problem with a single exponential potential we conclude that the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraint is not fulfilled if the universe is to undergo a TPA. The 3-fluid model remains a good approximation for the description of large scale structures.
We study the effect of the extrinsic curvature within the context of braneworld with constant curvature and the restrictions on a spherically symmetric geometry embedded in a 5-d bulk. As a counterexample, we recover the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole but with umbilical points. In a second case we find the correct geometrical structure of a black hole but the Newtonian gravity cannot be restored implying that a higher dynamical embedding must be considered.
Analytic gravitational collapse and expansion solutions with anisotropic pressure are generated. Metric functions are found by requiring zero heat flow scalar. It emerges that a single function generates the anisotropic solutions. Each generating function contains an arbitrary function of time which can be chosen to fit various astrophysical time profiles. Two examples are provided: a bounded collapse metric and an expanding cosmological solution.
In the present study we consider the Hamiltonian of the Dirac equation in curved space in fermi normal coordinates to first order in the Riemann tensor, including the corrections to the electromagnetic field. Then the energy level shifts by the local curvature for both relativistic and nonrelativistic levels in (Anti-)de Sitter space-time are calculated.

This is an English translation of a paper by Pascual Jordan, Juergen Ehlers and Rainer Sachs, first published in 1961 in the proceedings of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz (Germany). The original paper was part 2 of a five-part series of articles containing the first summary of knowledge about exact solutions of Einstein’s equations found until then. (Parts 1 and 4 of the series have already been reprinted, parts 3 and 5 will be printed as Golden Oldies in near future.) This second paper discusses the geometry of geodesic null congruences, the algebraic classification of the Weyl tensor by spinor methods, and applies these to a study of the propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. It has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for republication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. The republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Malcolm A. H. MacCallum and Wolfgang Kundt.
We show that within single brane tachyonic braneworld models, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">super-exponential</em> warp factors of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(e^{-2f} \sim e^{-2c_1e^{c_2 |\sigma |}}\)</span> are problematic when dealing with both the finiteness of the effective four-dimensional (4d) Planck mass and the localization of 4d gravity, which can be stated by the requirement that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\int e^{-2f(\sigma )}d\sigma &lt; \infty \)</span>, because this condition necessarily implies that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(c_2\)</span> should be positive. As a consequence of this fact the tachyonic field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(T\)</span> turns out to be complex in contradiction with the real nature of the starting action for the tachyonic braneworld. Conversely if one requires to have a real tachyon field, 4d gravity will not be localized and the effective gravitational coupling will be infinite. We present several typical examples where this problem occurs: we have analysed this situation for thin as well as thick tachyonic braneworlds with 4d Poincaré symmetry, for the case when a bulk cosmological constant is present, and even for a brane with an induced spatially flat 4d cosmological background, and shown that in all cases the tachyon field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(T\)</span> comes out to be inconsistently complex when imposing localization of 4d gravity on the brane. On the other hand, when dealing with a further reduction of the hierarchy problem on a two-brane system, one should carefully consider the sign of the constants <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(c_2\)</span> to avoid inconsistencies in the tachyonic braneworld model. We also present a similar discusion involving a canonical scalar field in the bulk where none of these problems arise and hence, the mass hierarchy and 4d gravity localization problems can be successfully addressed at once, i.e., with the same warp factor. Finally, the stability analysis of this scalar tensor braneworld model with a super-exponential warp factor is performed.
In the context of general relativity, radiation, either gravitational or electromagnetic, is closely associated to vorticity of observers world lines. We stress in this letter that the factor that relates the two phenomena is a circular flow of energy (electromagnetic) and/or superenergy on the planes orthogonal to vorticity vector. We also stress the potential relevance of the abovementioned relationship in experiments to detect gravitational radiation.
A space of kinematic quantum states for the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity is constructed by means of projective techniques. The states are kinematic in this sense that their construction bases merely on the structure of the phase space of the theory and does not take into account constraints on it. The space of quantum states is meant to serve as an element of a canonical background independent quantization of the theory.
It is known that the emission rate of entropy from a Schwarzschild black hole is exactly the same as that of a one dimensional quantum channel (Bekenstein and Mayo in Gen. Relativ. Gravit. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">33</strong>:2095–2099, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2001</a></span>). We calculate the dimension of entropy emission from a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D\)</span> dimensional pure Lovelock black holes. Our results indicate that the dimension of transmission for odd <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D\)</span> dimensional space-times is equal to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(D\)</span> and for even <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(D\)</span> dimensional space-times, the dimension of quantum channel becomes <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(1+\varepsilon (\Lambda )\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\( \Lambda \)</span> is cosmological constant. It is interesting that cosmological constant may put some constraint on dimension of quantum channel in even dimensional space-times. The effect of Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the dimension of transmission of entropy for a Schwarzschild black hole is also investigated.
With the tracking condition, the stability of quintessence solutions are examined. It is found that there is only one physically relevant fixed point for the system generically. Two specific examples of quintessence potentials are worked out in the frame work.
We study the junction condition relating the pressure to the heat flux at the boundary of a shearing and expanding spherically symmetric radiating star when the fluid particles are travelling in geodesic motion. The Lie symmetry generators that leave the junction condition invariant are identified and the optimal system is generated. We use each element of the optimal system to transform the partial differential equation to an ordinary differential equation. New exact solutions, which are group invariant under the action of Lie point infinitesimal symmetries, are found. We obtain families of traveling wave solutions and self-similar solutions, amongst others. The gravitational potentials are given in terms of elementary functions, and the line elements can be given explicitly in all cases. We show that the Friedmann dust model is regained as a special case, and we can connect our results to earlier investigations.
We propose a method for constructing the specific heat for the universe by following standard definitions of classical thermodynamics, in a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. We use cosmography to represent the specific heat in terms of measurable quantities, and show that a negative specific heat at constant volume and a zero specific heat at constant pressure are compatible with observational data. We derive the most general cosmological model which is compatible with the values obtained for the specific heat of the universe, and show that it alleviates the fine-tuning and the coincidence problems of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model.
We consider the geodesic equation in impulsive <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pp</em>-wave space-times in Rosen form, where the metric is of Lipschitz regularity. We prove that the geodesics (in the sense of Carathéodory) are actually continuously differentiable, thereby rigorously justifying the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal C}^1\)</span>-matching procedure which has been used in the literature to explicitly derive the geodesics in space-times of this form.
In this paper, we study the instability range of the collapsing fluid bounded by the plane geometry. For this purpose, the expansion-free dynamical equations in Newtonian and post-Newtonian regimes are obtained through perturbation scheme. We investigate the role of pressure anisotropy and energy density inhomogeneity in the instability ranges of expansion-free fluid. It is concluded that the instability regions for the plane geometry turns out to be large than the spherical case.
In this paper, we have made an attempt to reformulate the generalized field equation and various quantum equations of massive dyons in terms of octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two (external and internal) four dimensional spaces. The octonion forms of generalized potential and current equations of massive dyons are discussed in consistent manner. It has been shown that due to the non associativity of octonion variables it is necessary to impose certain constraints to describe generalized octonion massive electrodynamics in manifestly covariant and consistent manner.
Static spherically symmetric black holes and particle like solutions with self interacting minimally coupled scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varphi \)</span> are analyzed. They are asymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter (AdS). We express them in terms of a single function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\rho \)</span> which undergoes simple conditions. If <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varphi \)</span> is nontrivial the ADM mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(M\)</span> has to be positive. No-hair theorems are generalized to the AdS asymptotic. For both asymptotics the Killing horizon is nondegenerate and its radius cannot be bigger than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(2M\)</span>. Derivatives of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\rho \)</span> at singularity determine properties of admissible potentials <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(V(\varphi )\)</span> as regularity, boundedness and behavior for maximal values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\varphi \)</span>. Several classes of solutions with singular or nonsingular potentials are obtained. Their examples are presented in a form of plots.
The optical medium analogy of a given spacetime was developed decades ago and has since then been widely applied to different gravitational contexts. Here we consider the case of a colliding gravitational wave spacetime, generalizing previous results concerning single gravitational pulses. Given the complexity of the nonlinear interaction of two gravitational waves in the framework of general relativity, typically leading to the formation of either horizons or singularities, the optical medium analogy proves helpful to simply capture some interesting effects of photon propagation.
The extraction of the gravitational wave signal, within the context of a characteristic numerical evolution is revisited. A formula for the gravitational wave strain is developed and tested, and is made publicly available as part of the PITT code within the Einstein Toolkit. Using the new strain formula, we show that artificial non-linear drifts inherent in time integrated waveforms can be reduced for the case of a binary black hole merger configuration. For the test case of a rapidly spinning stellar core collapse model, however, we find that the drift must have different roots.
Non-abelian gauge field inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation scenario. We introduce this scenario as a mechanism that gives an end for gauge-flation model. Slow-roll parameters and perturbation parameters are presented for this model. We find the general conditions which are required for this model to be realizable in slow-roll approximation. We also develop our model in the context of intermediate and logamediate scenarios which are exact solutions of inflationary field equation in the Einstein theory. General expressions of slow-roll parameters, tensor–scalar ratio and scalar spectral index are presented in terms of inflaton field for these two cases. Our model is compatible with recent observational data from Planck satellite.
We construct a class of static, axially symmetric solutions representing razor-thin disks of matter in the Integrable Weyl–Dirac theory proposed in Israelit (Found Phys 29:1303, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29">1999</a></span>). The main differences between these solutions and the corresponding general relativistic one are analyzed, focusing on the behavior of physical observables (rotation curves of test particles, density and pressure profiles). We consider the case in which test particles move along Weyl geodesics. The same rotation curve can be obtained from many different solutions of the Weyl–Dirac theory, although some of these solutions present strong qualitative differences with respect to the usual general relativistic model (such as the appearance of a ring-like density profile). In particular, for typical galactic parameters all rotation curves of the Weyl–Dirac model present Keplerian fall-off. As a consequence, we conclude that a more thorough analysis of the problem requires the determination of the gauge function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\beta \)</span> on galactic scales, as well as restrictions on the test-particle behavior under the action of the additional geometrical fields introduced by this theory.
We consider the relativistic theory of irreversible processes with the aim to answer the following questions: (1) Under which conditions is this theory a relativistic generalization of the non-relativistic theory of irreversible processes (in particular, this implies to ask for the conditions under which the first law of thermodynamics can be recovered from the relativistic conservation law of total energy), and (2) how do the relativistic corrections look like? To this end, we perform a low-energy approximation for the balance equations underlying the theory, i.e., for the balances of the particle number, the energy-momentum and the entropy. It is shown that, going up to the 3rd order in the expansion series of the balances, the non-relativistic theory can be derived when one assumes that the 4-current of the particle flow is purely convective and the product of the 3-dimensional acceleration and velocity is equal to zero. Afterwards, the higher-order terms are discussed. Since our discussion mainly makes use of those balance equations that lie on the basis of most versions of continuum thermodynamics, the results do not only refer to early TIP presented by Eckart (Phys Rev 58:919, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1940</a></span>) and Landau and Lifshitz (Fluid mechanics. Pergamon Press, Oxford, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1940</a></span>), but also to its extended and/or general-relativistic versions.
We perform the complete canonical analysis of the tetrad formulation of bimetric gravity and confirm that it is ghost-free describing the seven degrees of freedom of a massless and a massive gravitons. In particular, we find explicit expressions for secondary constraints, one of which is responsible for removing the ghost, whereas the other ensures the equivalence with the metric formulation. Both of them have a remarkably simple form and, being combined with conditions on Lagrange multipliers, can be written in a covariant way.
We present the second (and final) part of an analysis aimed at introducing variables which are suitable for constructing a space of quantum states for the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. In the first part of the analysis we introduced a family of variables on the “position” sector of the phase space. In this paper we distinguish differentiable variables in the family. Then we define momenta conjugate to the differentiable variables and express constraints of the theory in terms of the variables and the momenta. Finally, we exclude variables which generate an obstacle for further steps of the Dirac’s procedure of canonical quantization of constrained systems we are going to apply to the theory. As a result we obtain two collections of variables on the phase space which will be used (in a subsequent paper) to construct the desired space of quantum states.
Lovelock theory is the natural extension of general relativity to higher dimensions. It can be also thought of as a toy model for ghost-free higher curvature corrections in gravitational theories. It admits a family of AdS vacua, which provides an appealing arena to explore different holographic aspects in a broader setup within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We will elaborate on these features and review previous work concerning the constraints that Lovelock theory entails on the CFT parameters when imposing conditions like unitarity, positivity of the energy or causality.
We derive a new constraint algebra for a Hamiltonian formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity treated as a theory of cotetrad fields on a spacetime. The algebra turns out to be closed.
We present a closed-form solution to Kerr black hole in the harmonic coordinate system. The formulation reduces to the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation for the rotating spherically symmetric system in the far-field limit. Basing on the harmonic metric, we also derive the analytical formulations for the 2PN dynamics of particle and photon for Kerr black hole. The harmonic form of Kerr metric in the horizon-penetrating coordinates is also presented.
Recently Melia and Shevchuk (Mon Not R Astron Soc 419:2579,<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2012</a></span>) (MS) have proposed the so-called <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(R_h =ct\)</span> cosmology where the “Gravitational Horizon” of the universe <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R_h\)</span> is equal to the distance travelled by light since “Big Bang”. Here we would like to see whether the basic claim <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(R_h=ct\)</span> is correct or not because MS have not given any cogent derivation for the same. Essentially we will compare the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">twin</em> expressions for the Einstein energy momentum complex (EMC) of the Friedmann universe obtained by using an appropriate superpotential and also by a direct method. To enable a meaningful comparison of the twin expressions, both are computed by using the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">same</em> quasi-Cartesian coordinates. We however do not claim that Einstein EMC is superior to many other routes of defining EM of a self-gravitating system. In fact, for static isolated spherical syatems, the idea of a coordinate independent field energy of Lynden-Bell and Katz (Mon Not R Astron Soc 213:21, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">1985</a></span>) might be quite physically significant. Yet, here, we use Einstein EMC because (i) our system is non-static and not isolated one (ii) our primary aim is not find any absolute value of EM, and, finally, (iii) only Einstein pseudo-tensor offers equivalent <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">twin</em> expressions for EM which one can be equated irrespective of any physical significance. Following such comparison of equivalent twin expressions of Einstein energy, we find an exact proof as to why Friedmann universe must be spatially flat even though, mathematically one can conceive of curved spaces in any dimension. Additionally, it follows that, apparently, the scale factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(S(t) \propto t\)</span> as insisted by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(R_h=ct\)</span> proposition. Nonetheless, because of close similarity of this form, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(S(t) \propto t\)</span>, with the (vacuum) Milne metric, and also because of implied unphysical equation of state, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(R_h=ct\)</span> cosmology is unlikely to represent the physical universe.
Using the effective four-dimensional Einstein field equations, we build analytical models of spherically symmetric stars in the brane-world, in which the external space-time contains both an ADM mass and a tidal charge. In order to determine the interior geometry, we apply the principle of minimal geometric deformation, which allows one to map general relativistic solutions to solutions of the effective four-dimensional brane-world equations. We further restrict our analysis to stars with a radius linearly related to the total general relativistic mass, and obtain a general relation between the latter, the brane-world ADM mass and the tidal charge. In these models, the value of the star’s radius can then be taken to zero smoothly, thus obtaining brane-world black hole metrics with a tidal charge solely determined by the mass of the source and the brane tension. We find configurations which entail a partial screening of the gravitational mass, and general conclusions regarding the minimum mass for semiclassical black holes are also drawn.
The state space of Loop Quantum Gravity admits a decomposition into orthogonal subspaces associated to diffeomorphism equivalence classes of spin-network graphs. In this paper I investigate the possibility of obtaining this state space from the quantization of a topological field theory with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">many</em> degrees of freedom. The starting point is a 3-manifold with a network of defect-lines. A locally-flat connection on this manifold can have non-trivial holonomy around non-contractible loops. This is in fact the mathematical origin of the Aharonov–Bohm effect. I quantize this theory using standard field theoretical methods. The functional integral defining the scalar product is shown to reduce to a finite dimensional integral over moduli space. A non-trivial measure given by the Faddeev–Popov determinant is derived. I argue that the scalar product obtained coincides with the one used in Loop Quantum Gravity. I provide an explicit derivation in the case of a single defect-line, corresponding to a single loop in Loop Quantum Gravity. Moreover, I discuss the relation with spin-networks as used in the context of spin foam models.
The null surface formulation of general relativity (NSF) provides an alternative way of describing the gravitational field and focuses exclusively on families of null surfaces. The metric is not needed. The present paper presents an exact solution of the (2+1)-dimensional NSF by solving the third-order nonlinear field equations directly. The resulting solution is non-singular and is shown to describe a perfect fluid with vorticity.
In this paper we calculate the Bondi mass of asymptotically flat spacetimes with interacting electromagnetic and scalar fields. The system of coupled Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon equations is investigated and corresponding field equations are written in the spinor form and in the Newman–Penrose formalism. Asymptotically flat solution of the resulting system is found near null infinity. Finally we use the asymptotic twistor equation to find the Bondi mass of the spacetime and derive the Bondi mass-loss formula. We compare the results with our previous work (Bičák et al. in Class Quantum Gravity 27(17):175011, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2010</a></span>) and show that, unlike the conformal scalar field, the (Maxwell–)Klein–Gordon field has negatively semi-definite mass-loss formula.
Modified gravity is one of the most favorable candidates for explaining the current accelerating expansion of the Universe. In this regard, we study the viability of an alternative gravitational theory, namely <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R,G)\)</span>, by imposing energy conditions. We consider two forms of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(R,G)\)</span>, commonly discussed in the literature, which account for the stability of cosmological solutions. We construct the inequalities obtained by energy conditions and specifically apply the weak energy condition using the recent estimated values of the Hubble, deceleration, jerk and snap parameters to probe the viability of the above-mentioned forms of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R, G)\)</span>.
We will consider the most general least-order derivative action for the torsional completion of gravitational backgrounds filled with left-handed and right-handed semi-spinorial fields, accounting for all parity-even as well as parity-odd contributions; we will proceed by performing the customary analysis, decomposing torsion and substituting it in terms of the semi-spinorial density currents, in order to obtain the effective action with the torsionally-induced self-interacting potentials among the chiral fermionic fields: we shall see that the resulting effective non-linear potentials will turn eventually out to be parity conserving after all.
Applying Dirac’s procedure to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r\)</span>-dependent constrained systems, we derive a reduced total Hamiltonian, resembling an upside down harmonic oscillator, which generates the Schwarzschild solution in the mini super-spacetime. Associated with the now <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r\)</span>-dependent Schrodinger equation is a tower of localized Guth-Pi-Barton wave packets, orthonormal and non-singular, admitting equally spaced average-‘energy’ levels. Our approach is characterized by a universal quantum mechanical uncertainty structure which enters the game already at the flat spacetime level, and accompanies the massive Schwarzschild sector for any arbitrary mean mass. The average black hole horizon surface area is linearly quantized.
We study the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black hole thermodynamics using the simplest form of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) proposed in the literature. The expressions for the mass-temperature relation, heat capacity and entropy are obtained in both cases from which the critical and remnant masses are computed. Our results are exact and reveal that these masses are identical and larger than the so called singular mass for which the thermodynamics quantities become ill-defined. The expression for the entropy reveals the well known area theorem in terms of the horizon area in both cases upto leading order corrections from GUP. The area theorem written in terms of a new variable which can be interpreted as the reduced horizon area arises only when the computation is carried out to the next higher order correction from GUP.
In this work we research on the thermodynamical properties of the Bardeen black holes. We compute the series of new thermodynamic quantities such as local temperature, heat capacity, free energy of this kind of black hole in detail. We further analyze the thermodynamical characteristics of the Bardeen black hole by varying its charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(q\)</span> to check the existence and stability of the black hole.
We study the black hole particle production in a regular spacetime metric obtained in a minisuperspace approach to loop quantum gravity. In different previous papers the static solution was obtained and shown to be singularity-free and self-dual. In this paper expanding a previous study of the black hole dynamics we repeat the Hawking analysis which leads to a thermal flux of particles at the future infinity. The evaporation time is infinite and the unitarity is recovered due to the regularity of the spacetime and to the characteristic behavior of the surface gravity.
We present the general method of constructing curved traversable wormholes in (3+1)-d spacetime and proceed to thoroughly discuss the physics of a zero tidal force metric without cross-terms. The (3+1)-d solution is compared with the recently studied lower-dimensional counterpart, where we identify that the much richer physics—involving pressures and shear forces of the mass-energy fluid supporting the former—is attributed to the mixing of all three spatial coordinates. Our (3+1)-d universe is the lowest dimension where such nontrivial terms appear. An explicit example, the static zero tidal force (3+1)-d catenary wormhole is analysed and we show the existence of a geodesic through it supported locally by non-exotic matter, similar to the (2+1)-d version. A key difference is that positive mass-energy is used to support the entire (3+1)-d catenary wormhole, though violation of the null energy condition in certain regions is inevitable. This general approach of first constructing the geometry of the spacetime and then using the field equations to determine the physics to support it has the potential to discover new solutions in general relativity or to generalise existing ones. For instance, the metric of a time-evolving inflationary wormhole with a conformal factor can actually be geometrically constructed using our method.
We investigate the geodesics’ kinematics and dynamics in the Linet–Tian metric with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span> and compare with the results for the Levi–Civita metric, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Lambda =0\)</span>. This is used to derive new stability results about the geodesics’ dynamics in static vacuum cylindrically symmetric spacetimes with respect to the introduction of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span>. In particular, we find that increasing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(|\Lambda |\)</span> always increases the minimum and maximum radial distances to the axis of any spatially confined planar null geodesic. Furthermore, we show that, in some cases, the inclusion of any <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span> breaks the geodesics’ orbit confinement of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\Lambda =0\)</span> metric, for both planar and non-planar null geodesics, which are therefore unstable. Using the full system of geodesics’ equations, we provide numerical examples which illustrate our results.
In this paper we consider the gauge invariant third quantized model of supersymmetric group field cosmology. The supersymmetric BRST invariance for such theory in non-linear gauge is also analysed. The path integral formulation to the case of a multiverse made up of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes filled with a perfect fluid is presented. The renormalizability for the scattering of universes in multiverse are established with suitably constructed master equations for connected diagrams and proper vertices. The Slavnov–Taylor identities for this theory hold to all orders of radiative corrections.
In continuum physics is presupposed that general-relativistic balance equations are valid which are created from the Lorentz-covariant ones by application of the equivalence principle. Consequently, the question arises, how to make these general-covariant balances compatible with Einstein’s field equations, if no Lagrangian is available. The compatibility conditions are derived by performing a modified Belinfante–Rosenfeld symmetrization for the non-symmetric and not divergence-free general-relativistic energy-momentum tensor of continuum physics. The procedure results in the Mathisson–Papapetrou equations.
In this paper we consider some applications of the extended Dray-t’Hooft–Redmount relation, considered earlier in Neronov (JHEP 11:007, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2001</a></span>), Langlois and Maeda (Phys Rev Lett 88:181301, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2002</a></span>), Berezin and Smirnov (Gravit Cosmol 9(4):235, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2003</a></span>). In particular, using this relation, we study geometries of interacting thin shells near the future Cauchy horizon of a Reissner–Nordstrøm black hole.
Neutron stars and black holes are the most compact astrophysical objects we can think of and as a consequence they are the main sources of gravitational waves. There are many astrophysically relevant scenarios in which these objects are immersed in or endowed with strong magnetic fields, in such a way that gravitational perturbations can couple to electromagnetic ones and can potentially trigger synergistic electromagnetic signatures. In a recent paper we derived the main equations for gravito-electromagnetic perturbations and studied in detail the case of polar electromagnetic perturbations driven by axial gravitational perturbations. In this paper we deal with the case of axial electromagnetic perturbations driven by polar black-hole or neutron stars oscillations, in which the energy emitted in case is considerably larger than in the previous case. In the case of neutron stars the phenomenon lasts considerably longer since the fluid acts as an energy reservoir that shakes the magnetic field for a timescale of the order of secs.
Using the well-known “displace, cut and reflect” method we construct thin disks made of a perfect fluid in presence of a magnetic field. The models are based in a magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom metric of Einstein-Maxwell equations for a conformastatic spacetime. The influence of the magnetic field on the matter properties of the disk are analyzed. We also study the motion of charged test particles around the disks. We construct models of perfect fluid disks satisfying all the energy conditions.
I show that the gravitational dynamics in a bulk region of space can be connected to a thermodynamic description in the boundary of that region, thereby providing clear physical interpretations of several mathematical features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained in a bulk region, associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a direct thermodynamic interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes maintain holographic equipartition in the following sense: In these spacetimes, the number of degrees of freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational momentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. It is this departure from the holographic equipartition which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations of motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter within a bulk region, will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After motivating the need for an alternate description of gravity (if we have to solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic variational principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept of gravitational heat density of the null surfaces arises naturally from the Noether charge associated with the null congruence. The variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are described.
The numerical investigation of wave propagation in the asymptotic domain of Kerr spacetime has only recently been possible thanks to the construction of suitable hyperboloidal coordinates. The asymptotics revealed an apparent puzzle in the decay rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on whether finite distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away from the rotating black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbed ‘splitting.’ We discuss far-field ‘splitting’ in the full field and near-horizon ‘splitting’ in certain projected modes using horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates. For either case we propose an explanation to the cause of the ‘splitting’ behavior, and we determine uniquely decay rates that previous studies found to be ambiguous or immeasurable. The far-field ‘splitting’ is explained by competition between projected modes. The near-horizon ‘splitting’ is due to excitation of lower multipole modes that back excite the multipole mode for which ‘splitting’ is observed. In both cases ‘splitting’ is an intermediate effect, such that asymptotically in time strong field rates are valid at all finite distances. At any finite time, however, there are three domains with different decay rates whose boundaries move outwards during evolution. We then propose a formula for the decay rate of tails that takes into account the inter-mode excitation effect that we study.
We present a simplified expression for the gravitational angular momentum in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). The expression arises from the constraints equations of the Hamiltonian formulation of the TEGR. We apply this expression to the calculation of the angular momentum of plane-fronted gravitational waves in an arbitrary three-dimensional volume <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V\)</span> of space and compare the results with those obtained for linearised gravitational waves.
This is an English translation of a paper by Pascual Jordan and Wolfgang Kundt, first published in 1961 in the proceedings of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz (Germany). The original paper was part 3 of a five-part series of articles containing the first summary of knowledge about exact solutions of Einstein’s equations found until then. (Parts 1, 2 and 4 of the series have already been reprinted, part 5 will be printed as a Golden Oldie in near future.) This third paper shows how solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations with null Maxwell field can be incorporated into the scheme of geometrodynamics. It has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for republication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. The republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Charles Misner.

Einstein complex spacetimes admitting null Killing or null homothetic Killing vectors are studied. Such vectors define totally null and geodesic 2-surfaces called the null strings or twistor surfaces. Geometric properties of these null strings are discussed. It is shown, that spaces considered are hyperheavenly spaces (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal {HH}\)</span>-spaces) or, if one of the parts of the Weyl tensor vanishes, heavenly spaces (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal {H}\)</span>-spaces). The explicit complex metrics admitting null Killing vectors are found. Some Lorentzian and ultrahyperbolic slices of these metrics are discussed.
We investigate the Sagnac effect, representing the difference in travel time or phase shift observed for relativistic matter or light beams counter-propagating in a rotating interferometer. This is done for the Schwarzschild-like and Kerr-like vacuum solutions of conformal gravity which describe the field around a massive static and rotating object respectively, in the fourth order theory. To do this we employ the formal analogy between the Sagnac and Aharonov–Bohm effects that has been used earlier to study this effect in flat and curved spacetimes in general relativity. In particular we show that the linear term in the static metric of conformal gravity has a diminishing effect on the Sagnac time delay. Moreover using the expression for the Sagnac effect in the rotating Kerr-like spacetime, we show that the detection of the Weyl gravity contributions to the Sagnac time delay in the case of the Earth, lies beyond the capability of current experiments.
We construct a gedanken experiment in which an extremal Kerr black hole interacts with a test electromagnetic field. Using Teukolsky’s solutions for electromagnetic perturbations in Kerr spacetime, and the conservation laws imposed by the energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field and the Killing vectors of the spacetime, we prove that this interaction cannot convert the black hole into a naked singularity, thus cosmic censorship conjecture is not violated in this case.
Newman–Janis algorithm for Kerr–Newman geometry is reanalyzed in the light of Cartan calculus.
There should be two ways to describe the flat rotation curves of galaxies and cluster of galaxies. Either one can introduce a dark matter component for the matter filling the halo, or by modifying the gravity theory and give the flat rotation curve a geometrical nature. Here we adopt an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)\)</span> model suitable for describing the effect. After matching the solution with the exterior solution, the effective density, radial and tangential pressures are obtained. Then the energy conditions and lensing effect is investigated.
We present a new approach to the intrinsic properties of the type D vacuum solutions based on the invariant symmetries that these spacetimes admit. By using tensorial formalism and without explicitly integrating the field equations, we offer a new proof that the upper bound of covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor required for a Cartan–Karlhede classification is two. Moreover we show that, except for the Ehlers–Kundt’s C-metrics, the Riemann derivatives depend on the first order ones, and for the C-metrics they depend on the first order derivatives and on a second order constant invariant. In our analysis the existence of an invariant complex Killing vector plays a central role. It also allows us to easily obtain and to geometrically interpret several known relations. We apply to the vacuum case the intrinsic classification of the type D spacetimes based on the first order differential properties of the 2 + 2 Weyl principal structure, and we show that only six classes are compatible. We define several natural and suitable subclasses and present an operational algorithm to detect them.
In this paper we study the creation of super-massive real scalar particles in the framework of a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)=R-\beta /R^n\)</span> modified gravity theory, with parameters constrained by observational data. The analysis is restrict to a homogeneous and isotropic flat and radiation dominated universe. We compare the results to the standard Einstein gravity with cosmological constant (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda CDM\)</span> model), and we show that the total number density of created particles in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R)\)</span> model is very close to the standard case. Another interesting result is that the spectrum of created particles is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\beta \)</span> independent at early times.
Warm inflation model with bulk viscous pressure in the context of “intermediate inflation” where the cosmological scale factor expands as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(a(t)=a_0\exp (At^f)\)</span>, is studied. The characteristics of this model in slow-roll approximation and in high dissipative regime are presented in two cases: 1—Dissipative parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Gamma \)</span> as a function of scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\phi \)</span> and bulk viscous coefficient <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\zeta \)</span> as a function of energy density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\rho \)</span>. 2—<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Gamma \)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\zeta \)</span> are constant parameters. Scalar, tensor perturbations and spectral indices for this scenario are obtained. The cosmological parameters appearing in the present model are constrained by recent observational data (WMAP7).
The new class of the non-stationary solutions to the system of N-dimensional equations for coupled gravitational and massless scalar field is found. The model represents a single (N-1)-brane in a space-time with one large (infinite) and (N-5) small (compact) space-like extra dimensions. In some particular cases the model corresponds to the gravitational and scalar field standing waves bounded by the brane. These braneworlds can be relevant in string and other higher dimensional models.
In this paper we present the cosmological viability of reconstruction of an alternative gravitational theory, namely, the modified <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(f(R,T)\)</span> gravity, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(R\)</span> is the Ricci scalar curvature and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(T\)</span> the trace of stress energy momentum tensor. A functional form of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R,T)= R + 2f(T)\)</span> is chosen for the reconstruction in perfect fluid flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker model. The gravitational field equations contain two fluid sources, one is perfect fluid and other is due to modified <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(f(R,T)\)</span> gravity which is to be considered as an exotic fluid. This allows us for derivation and analysis of a set of new cosmological solutions for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(f(R,T)\)</span> gravity by considering these two fluids as a non-interacting. Two known forms of scale factor (de Sitter and power-law) are considered for the explicit and successful reconstruction. The equation of state parameter (EoS) of exotic matter and the effective EoS parameter have been discussed. In de Sitter solution we find that the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(f(R,T)\)</span> fluid behaves as phantom dark energy when the usual matter (perfect fluid) shows the behavior between decelerated phase to accelerated phase. In the absence of usual matter it behaves as a cosmological constant. In case of power -law cosmology two different cases are discussed and analyzed the behavior of different phases of the universe accordingly through the equation of state and density parameters.
General classical theories of material fields in an arbitrary Riemann–Cartan space are considered. For these theories, with the help of equations of balance, new non-trivially generalized, manifestly generally covariant expressions for canonical energy-momentum and spin tensors are constructed in the cases when a Lagrangian contains (a) an arbitrary set of tensorial material fields and their covariant derivatives up to the second order, as well as (b) the curvature tensor and (c) the torsion tensor with its covariant derivatives up to the second order. A non-trivial manifestly generally covariant generalization of the Belinfante symmetrization procedure, suitable for an arbitrary Riemann–Cartan space, is carried out. A covariant symmetrized energy-momentum tensor is constructed in a general form.
The novel idea that spatial expansion of our universe can be regarded as the consequence of the emergence of space was proposed by Padmanabhan. By using of the basic law governing the emergence, which Padmanabhan called holographic equipartition, he also arrives at the Friedmann equation in a flat universe. When generalized to other gravity theories, the holographic equipartition need to be generalized with an expression of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(\Delta N,N_{sur})\)</span>. In this paper, we give general expressions of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(\Delta N,N_{sur})\)</span> for generalized holographic equipartition which can be used to derive the Friedmann equations of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe with any spatial curvature in higher (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\hbox {n}+1\)</span>)-dimensional Einstein gravity, Gauss–Bonnet gravity and more general Lovelock gravity. The results support the viability of the perspective of holographic equipartition.
In this paper we show that the gravitational field equations of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((n+1)\)</span>-dimensional topological black holes with constant horizon curvature, in cubic and quartic quasi-topological gravity, can be recast in the form of the first law of thermodynamics, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(dE=TdS-PdV\)</span>, at the black hole horizon. This procedure leads to extract an expression for the horizon entropy as well as the energy (mass) in terms of the horizon radius, which coincide exactly with those obtained in quasi-topological gravity by solving the field equations and using the Wald’s method. We also argue that this approach is powerful enough to be extended to all higher order quasi-topological gravity for extracting the corresponding entropy and energy in terms of horizon radius.
The rotation effect of the gravitational source such as Kerr black hole on the time delay of light propagation has been studied in detail. Although it belongs to the second order, the magnitude of rotation effect may be smaller than that of the third-order effect of mass. In this paper, we calculate the time delay of the propagation of light in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole to the third order analytically. It is found that the third-order effect of mass is larger than the rotation effect when the magnitude of impact factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(|b| &lt; \frac{120-5\pi }{16}\frac{M^3}{J}+M\)</span>, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(M\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(J\)</span> being the mass and angular momentum of black hole. The total third-order effects on the time delay are also examined.
In this paper, the real, complex octonion algebra and their properties are defined. The electromagnetic and gravito-electromagnetic equations with monopoles in terms of S and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\hbox {S}^{\prime }\)</span> reference systems are presented in vector notations. Additionally, the duality transformations of gravito-electromagnetic situation for two reference systems are also represented. Besides, it is explained that Maxwell-like equations for gravito-electromagnetism are also invariant under Lorentz transformations. By introducing complex octonionic differential operator, a new generalized complex octonionic field term consisting of electromagnetic and gravito-electromagnetic components has been firstly suggested for Lorentz system. Afterwards, a complex octonionic source equation is obtained as in basic way, more compact and elegant notation. By defining a new complex octonionic general potential term, the field equation is attained once again. The components of complex octonionic field and wave equations are written in detailed for S and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\hbox {S}^{\prime }\)</span> reference systems.
The rotation of the Earth produces gravitomagnetic components of the Riemann curvature tensor, which are of the order of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(10^{-10}\)</span> of the Newtonian terms arising from the mass of the Earth. Detection of the gravitomagnetic field is very important, since it tests one of the most fundamental predictions of general relativity. We review the experimental scheme for detecting the gravitomagnetic effect with an orbiting gravity gradiometer in an inertial frame. Two factors which can affect the experiment, satellite positioning errors and Earth’s multipole moments, are analyzed. We derive the satellite positioning accuracy required for construction of matched templates with sufficient precision. We find that the satellite orbit must be carefully selected to avoid some dangerous altitudes at which Earth’s multipole moments can mask gravitomagnetic signals. Allowable orbit altitudes are computed. We also examine an alternative scheme, in which the gradiometer is fixed to a local inertial frame defined by gyroscopes. In this experiment, the gradient signal grows linearly with time due to the Lense–Thirring effect, and the satellite positioning errors and Earth’s multipole moments become negligible.
Starting from an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n\)</span>-point circular gravitational lens having <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(3n+1\)</span> images, Rhie (ArXiv Astrophysics e-prints, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15">2003</a></span>) used a perturbation argument to construct an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\((n+1)\)</span>-point lens producing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(5n\)</span> images. In this work we give a concise proof of Rhie’s result, and we extend the range of parameters in Rhie’s model for which maximal lensing occurs. We also study a slightly different construction given by Bayer and Dyer (Gen Relativ Gravit 39(9):1413–1418, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2007</a></span>) arising from the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\((3n+1)\)</span>-point lens. In particular, we extend their results and give sharp parameter bounds for their lens model. By a substitution of variables and parameters we show that both models are equivalent in a certain sense.
We consider critical gravity in three dimensions; that is, the New Massive Gravity theory formulated about Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with the specific value of the graviton mass for which it results dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory with vanishing central charge. As it happens with Kerr black holes in four-dimensional critical gravity, in three-dimensional critical gravity the Bañados–Teitelboim–Zanelli black holes have vanishing mass and vanishing angular momentum. However, provided suitable asymptotic conditions are chosen, the theory may also admit solutions carrying non-vanishing charges. Here, we give simple examples of exact solutions that exhibit falling-off conditions that are even weaker than those of the so-called Log-gravity. For such solutions, we define the quasilocal stress-tensor and use it to compute conserved charges. Despite the drastic deformation of AdS<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(_3\)</span> asymptotic, these solutions have non-zero mass and angular momentum, which we compute.
We investigate the existence of repulsive gravitational acceleration near naked singularities. The investigation is carried out by means of the acceleration tensor, which is a coordinate invariant object. We find that the gravitational acceleration is repulsive in the vicinity of the origin in the Reissner–Nordstrøm and in the Kerr space-times, and attractive at large distances in the expected Newtonian way. We further address the space-time of a point massive particle, which also exhibits repulsive effects near the origin.
We consider the general case of an accelerating, expanding and shearing model of a radiating relativistic star using Lie symmetries. We obtain the Lie symmetry generators that leave the equation for the junction condition invariant, and find the Lie algebra corresponding to the optimal system of the symmetries. The symmetries in the optimal system allow us to transform the boundary condition to ordinary differential equations. The various cases for which the resulting systems of equations can be solved are identified. For each of these cases the boundary condition is integrated and the gravitational potentials are found explicitly. A particular group invariant solution produces a class of models which contains Euclidean stars as a special case. Our generalized model satisfies a linear equation of state in general. We thus establish a group theoretic basis for our generalized model with an equation of state. By considering a particular example we show that the weak, dominant and strong energy conditions are satisfied.
The paper describes the progress toward a space-borne gravitational wave observatory and its foreseeable science potential. In particular the paper describes the status of the LISA-like mission called eLISA, the reference mission for the Gravitational Universe theme adopted by ESA for its Large mission L3, and the status of its precursor LISA Pathfinder, due to launch in 2015.
We present a comparison of the calculation of BTZ black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity and in spin foam models. We see that both give proportional answers.
The quasinormal modes of massless scalar field perturbation of the Reissner–Nordström de Sitter black hole with a global monopole is investigated using the 6th order WKB method. The results show that the magnitude of the real part of the quasinormal frequencies decreases, while the magnitude of the imaginary one increases as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(b\)</span> (related to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\eta \)</span>—the scale factor of symmetry-broking) increases for fixed angular harmonic index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(l\)</span>, overtone index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(n\)</span>, cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda \)</span> and charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(Q\)</span>. For fixed <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(l\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(n\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\Lambda \)</span>, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(b\)</span>, the damping of massless scalar field in the space–time of the Reissner–Nordström de Sitter black hole with a global monopole faster and faster at first and afterwards becomes slower and slower with the increase of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(Q\)</span> when the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(\Lambda \)</span> is smaller, while the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(\Lambda \)</span> is larger, the damping becomes faster and faster all the way with the increase of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq14">\(Q\)</span>.
We discuss the relationship between the bulk-boundary correspondence in Rehren’s algebraic holography (and in other ‘fixed-background’, QFT-based, approaches to holography) and in mainstream string-theoretic ‘Maldacena AdS/CFT’. Especially, we contrast the understanding of black-hole entropy from the point of view of QFT in curved spacetime—in the framework of ’t Hooft’s ‘brick wall’ model—with the understanding based on Maldacena AdS/CFT. We show that the brick-wall modification of a Klein–Gordon field in the Hartle–Hawking–Israel state on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+2\)</span> dimensional Schwarzschild AdS has a well-defined boundary limit with the same temperature and entropy as the brick-wall-modified bulk theory. One of our main purposes is to point out a close connection, for general AdS/CFT situations, between the puzzle raised by Arnsdorf and Smolin regarding the relationship between Rehren’s algebraic holography and mainstream AdS/CFT and the puzzle embodied in the ‘complementarity principle’ proposed by Mukohyama and Israel in their work on the brick-wall approach to black hole entropy. Working on the assumption that similar results will hold for bulk QFT other than the Klein–Gordon field and for Schwarzschild AdS in other dimensions, and recalling the first author’s proposed resolution to the Mukohyama–Israel puzzle based on his ‘matter–gravity entanglement hypothesis’, we argue that, in Maldacena AdS/CFT, the algebra of the boundary CFT is isomorphic only to a proper subalgebra of the bulk algebra, albeit (at non-zero temperature) the (GNS) Hilbert spaces of bulk and boundary theories are still the ‘same’—the total bulk state being pure, while the boundary state is mixed (thermal). We also argue from the finiteness of its boundary (and hence, on our assumptions, also bulk) entropy at finite temperature, that the Rehren dual of the Maldacena boundary CFT cannot itself be a QFT and must, instead, presumably be something like a string theory.
It has recently been conjectured that the Anti-de Sitter space is unstable under arbitrarily small perturbations. This article (based on my plenary talk of the same title at the conference GR20 in Warsaw) briefly reviews numerical and analytical evidence supporting this conjecture, putting emphasis on weak turbulence as a driving mechanism of instability.
We investigate non-spherically symmetric, scalar field collapse of a family of initial data consisting of a spherically symmetric profile with a deformation proportional to the real part of the spherical harmonic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(Y_{21}(\theta ,\varphi )\)</span>. Independent of the strength of the anisotropy in the data, we find that supercritical collapse yields a black hole mass scaling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(M_h \propto (p-p^*)^\gamma \)</span> with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\gamma \approx 0.37\)</span>, a value remarkably close to the critical exponent obtained by Choptuik in his pioneering study in spherical symmetry. We also find hints of discrete self-similarity. However, the collapse experiments are not sufficiently close to the critical solution to unequivocally claim that the detected periodicity is from critical collapse echoing.
The paper deals with a dynamical system analysis related to phantom cosmological model. Here gravity is coupled to phantom scalar field having scalar coupling function and a potential. The field equations are reduced to an autonomous dynamical system by a suitable redefinition of the basic variables and assuming some suitable form of the potential function. Finally, critical points are evaluated, their nature have been analyzed and corresponding cosmological scenario has been discussed.
The parallel session (A3), on “Modified Gravity”, enjoyed one on the largest number of abstract submissions (over 80), resulting in the selection of 24 oral presentations. The three short papers presented in the following sections are based on the session talks by Arif Mohd on thermodynamics of universal horizons in Einstein-Æther theory, Conformal anomalies in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity by Charles Melby-Thompson and detectability of scalar gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo by Peter Shawhan. They have been selected as a representative sample, to illustrate some of the best in the remarkable and encouraging variety of topics discussed in the session—ranging from highly theoretical, to phenomenological, observational, and experimental—with all these areas playing an integral part in our quest to understand the limits of standard general relativity.
The so-called Einstein-Aether theory is General Relativity coupled (at second derivative order) to a dynamical unit time-like vector field (the aether). It is a Lorentz-violating theory, and gained much attention in the recent years. In the present work, we study the cosmological evolution of Einstein-Aether models with power-law-like potential, by using the method of dynamical system. In the case without matter, there are two attractors which correspond to an inflationary universe in the early epoch, or a de Sitter universe in the late time. In the case with matter but there is no interaction between dark energy and matter, there are only two de Sitter attractors, and no scaling attractor exists. So, it is difficult to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem. Therefore, we then allow the interaction between dark energy and matter. In this case, several scaling attractors can exist under some complicated conditions, and hence the cosmological coincidence problem could be alleviated.
We display a simple solution to the Penrose CCC scenario. For this solution we chose for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">late stages</em> of the previous aeon a FRW, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\hbox {k}=0\)</span>, universe with both a cosmological constant and radiation (no mass) while for the early stages of the ‘present’ aeon we have again a FRW universe, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\hbox {k}=0\)</span>, with the same cosmological constant and again with radiation but with mass not yet present. The Penrose conditions force the parameters describing the radiation of the former and present aeons to be equal and the transition metric in the overlap region turns out to be flat. We further study how different rest-mass zero fields transition between the different conformally related regions. These (test) fields appears to easily allow perturbations of the geometry within the CCC scenario.
It has been observed on a number of occasions that complex transformations, of real solutions of the field equations to other real solutions, often preserve certain properties of the Weyl tensor. That is, the Petrov type and/or gravito-electromagnetic (GEM) properties of the Weyl tensor are preserved. In this context, we present an outstanding example of a complex windmill transformation of a static (non-physical) anisotropic fluid spacetime of Petrov type <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(I(M^+)\)</span> that maps to a purely magnetic (PM) spacetime of Petrov type <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(I(M^{\infty })\)</span>. The PM spacetime is analyzed and compared to the Arianrhod–Lun–McIntosh–Perjés spacetime. It is shown that these spacetimes, although similar in some aspects, are distinct solutions. The main distinction is that the generated PM spacetime satisfies all the standard energy-conditions. This intriguing but purely mathematical scenario may have implications in the area of GEM duality.
It is well known that the three parameters that characterize the Kerr black hole (mass, angular momentum and horizon area) satisfy several important inequalities. Remarkably, some of these inequalities remain valid also for dynamical black holes. This kind of inequalities play an important role in the characterization of the gravitational collapse. They are closed related with the cosmic censorship conjecture. In this article recent results in this subject are reviewed.
Neutron stars are laboratories for dense matter and gravitational physics. Observations of neutron stars from sources such as radio pulsars, low-mass X-ray binaries, X-ray bursts and thermally-emitting neutron stars are setting bounds to neutron star masses, radii, rotation rates, temperatures and ages. Mass measurements constrain the equation of state at the highest densities and set firm bounds to the highest possible density of cold matter. Radii constrain the equation of state in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation density and yield information about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. Laboratory measurements and theoretical studies of pure neutron matter are in remarkable agreement with observational bounds.
Extending researches on Hawking radiation to conformal gravity theory, we discuss Hawking radiation of different particles across charged rotating anti-de Sitter black holes in conformal gravity, including charged massive particles, complex scalar and spin <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(-1/2\)</span> Dirac particles. To make the study of rotating black holes’ tunneling radiation get rid of the dependence on dragging coordinate systems, we investigate the radiation without dragging coordinate transformations. The previous geodesic derivation existed some shortcomings. Not only did geodesics of massive and massless particles are derived by using quite different approaches, but also the treatment for massive case was inconsistent with the variation principle of action. Recently, Wu et al. have remedied the shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce the improved treatment in conformal gravity and derive geodesic equations of massive and massless particles in a unified and self-consistent way. Although the result that the black holes’ entropy is not one-quarter of horizon area differs from that in Einstein gravity, the tunneling probability of charged massive particles in conformal gravity is still related to the change of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.
Motivated by the recent interest in the study of the spacetimes that are asymptotically Lifshitz and in order to extend some previous results, we calculate exactly the quasinormal frequencies of the electromagnetic field in a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D\)</span>-dimensional asymptotically Lifshitz black hole. Based on the values obtained for the quasinormal frequencies we discuss the classical stability of the quasinormal modes. We also study whether the electromagnetic field possesses unstable modes in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D\)</span>-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime.
There are many hot discussions in the literature about two competing paradigms in galactic and extra-galactic astronomy and cosmology, namely the Dark Matter and the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). It is very difficult to challenge MOND from the cosmological side because a full relativistic realisation is needed in the first place, and any failure can then be attributed to a particular model, and not to the MOND itself. We propose to study non-relativistic stages of gravitational collapse in MOND which, we argue, is a relevant task for this competition. Spherically symmetric dust cloud collapse and intrinsic unavoidable non-linearities of the deep MOND regime are discussed. We conclude that complicated, both numerical and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">analytic</em>, studies of modified gravitational dynamics are needed in order to assess the viability of MOND.
In this paper, we exploit the fact that the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann–Lemaître universes is a special case of generalized Lotka–Volterra system where the competitive species are the barotropic fluids filling the Universe. Without coupling between those fluids, Lotka–Volterra formulation offers a pedagogical and simple way to interpret usual Friedmann–Lemaître cosmological dynamics. A natural and physical coupling between cosmological fluids is proposed which preserves the structure of the dynamical equations. Using the standard tools of Lotka–Volterra dynamics, we obtain the general Lyapunov function of the system when one of the fluids is coupled to dark energy. This provides in a rigorous form a generic asymptotic behavior for cosmic expansion in presence of coupled species, beyond the standard de Sitter, Einstein-de Sitter and Milne cosmologies. Finally, we conjecture that chaos can appear for at least four interacting fluids.
In this paper we analyze the Schr<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\ddot{o}\)</span>dinger-type scalar wave equation from JNW naked singularity spacetime and numerically investigate its absorption and scattering cross section. We find that total absorption cross section curve becomes lower as the coupling parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\nu \)</span> becomes bigger, the width of the main scattering angle becomes narrower and the peak of differential scattering cross section becomes higher as the angular momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(l\)</span> increases. With fixed frequency <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\omega \)</span> of scalar wave, the glory peak becomes lower and the glory width becomes narrower while increasing the coupling parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\nu \)</span>.
The Weyl<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(-\)</span>Yang gravitational gauge theory is investigated in the structure of a pure higher-dimensional non-Abelian Kaluza<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(-\)</span>Klein background. We construct the dimensionally reduced field equations and stress-energy-momentum tensors as well as the four dimensional modified Weyl<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(-\)</span>Yang<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(+\)</span>Yang<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq14">\(-\)</span>Mills theory from an arbitrary curved <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq15">\(internal\)</span> space in the anholonomic frame which are the extensions of our previous model for the non-Abelian case. In particular, the coset space reduction is considered to explicitly obtain the interactions between the gravitational and the gauge fields. The resulting equations not only appear to be generalization of the well-established equations of non-Abelian theory but also contain intrinsically the generalized gravitational source term which does not exist in the literature so far and the Yang<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq16">\(-\)</span>Mills force density which is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of a Yang<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq17">\(-\)</span>Mills quadratic invariant.
The hidden Kerr/CFT proposal implies that the massless scalar wave equation in the near-region and low-frequency limit respects a hidden SL(2,R)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\times \)</span>SL(2,R) invariance in the Kerr black hole spacetime. We may use this symmetry to determine quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) of the massless scalar wave propagating around the Kerr black hole algebraically. It is shown that QNFs obtained using the hidden conformal symmetry near the horizon correspond approximately to not only those of scalar perturbation around the near-horizon region of a nearly extremal Kerr (NEK) black hole, but also those of non-equatorial scalar modes around the NEK black hole. This indicates that the hidden Kerr/CFT proposal could determine quasinormal modes and frequencies of the massless scalar wave around the NEK (rapidly rotating) black hole approximately.
We observe that the standard homogeneous cosmologies, those of Minkowski, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter, which form the matrix for the Robertson–Walker scale factor, live naturally as isolated points inside a larger family of conformally flat metrics obtained by allowing a tensor containing the information of conformal symmetry breaking to be more general. So the standard cosmological metrics are parametrically unstable in this sense, and therefore unphysical. When we pass to the stable family of perturbed metrics, we immediately encounter a scalar field, which drives the conformal expansion of the universe and which automatically obeys the non-linear sine-Gordon equation. The Lagrangian for the sine-Gordon equation is a cosine potential agreeing to the fourth order with the potential used in the approach to the generation of mass in gauge theories. Accordingly we identify our geometric scalar field—actually of the type of an abelian gauge field—with the recently discovered scalar field. There are two constants in the theory: the first, named <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(m\)</span>, is positive and defines a mass scale for the universe; the second, named <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varLambda \)</span>, is the cosmological constant. For the space–time to be everywhere non-singular, equivalently for the (strict) dominant energy condition to hold, these constants must obey the inequality <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varLambda &gt; m^2/4\)</span>.
In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of black holes using a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with a correction term linear order in the momentum uncertainty. The mass-temperature relation and heat capacity are calculated from which critical and remnant masses are obtained. The results are exact and are found to be identical. The entropy expression gives the famous area theorem upto leading order corrections from GUP. In particular, the linear order term in GUP leads to a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sqrt{A}\)</span> correction to the area theorem. Finally, the area theorem can be expressed in terms of a new variable termed as reduced horizon area only when the calculation is done to the next higher order correction from GUP.

We construct a homothetic covariant Newtonian gravitation theory which unifies inertial homothetic forces and gravitational fields. This is achieved through an equivalence principle based on a local homothetic frame of motion. As a consequence, we can obtain a coherent Newtonian cosmology which admits a cosmological principle and leads to the Friedman equations for a dust universe. Finally we prove that this gravity theory can be obtained as the non-relativistic limit of a class of metrics in General Relativity. The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric and its limit are also studied.
The linearized Kerr metric is considered and put in some Gauss coordinates which are further <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrinsic</em> ones. The linear and angular 4-momenta of this metric are calculated in these coordinates and the resulting value is just zero. Thus, the global vanishing previously found for the Schwarzschild metric remains linearly stable under slow rotational perturbations of this metric.
We study the thermodynamics and the different thermodynamic geometric methods of Reissener-Nordström-de Sitter black hole and its extremal case, which is similar to the de Sitter black hole coupled to a scalar field, rather called an MTZ black hole. While studying the thermodynamics of the systems, we could find some abnormalities. In both cases, the thermodynamic geometric methods could give the correct explanation for all abnormal thermodynamic behaviors in the system.
In the first part of the present work, we focus on the theory of gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM), and we derive the full set of equations and constraints that the GEM scalar and vector potentials ought to satisfy. We discuss important aspects of the theory, such as the presence of additional constraints resulting from the field equations and gauge condition, the requirement of the time-independence of the vector potential and the emergence of additional terms in the expression of the Lorentz force. We also propose an alternative ansatz for the metric perturbations that is found to be compatible only with a vacuum configuration but evades several of the aforementioned obstacles. In the second part of this work, we pose the question of whether a tensorial theory using the formalism of General Relativity could re-produce the theory of Electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the full set of Maxwell’s equations can be exactly re-produced for a large class of models, but the framework has several weak points common with those found in GEM.
In this paper we analyze the Kerr geometry in the context of Conformal Gravity, an alternative theory of gravitation, which is a direct extension of General Relativity (GR). Following previous studies in the literature, we introduce an explicit expression of the Kerr metric in Conformal Gravity, which naturally reduces to the standard GR Kerr geometry in the absence of Conformal Gravity effects. As in the standard case, we show that the Hamilton–Jacobi equation governing geodesic motion in a space-time based on this geometry is indeed separable and that a fourth constant of motion—similar to Carter’s constant—can also be introduced in Conformal Gravity. Consequently, we derive the fundamental equations of geodesic motion and show that the problem of solving these equations can be reduced to one of quadratures. In particular, we study the resulting time-like geodesics in Conformal Gravity Kerr geometry by numerically integrating the equations of motion for Earth flyby trajectories of spacecraft. We then compare our results with the existing data of the Flyby Anomaly in order to ascertain whether Conformal Gravity corrections are possibly the origin of this gravitational anomaly. Although Conformal Gravity slightly affects the trajectories of geodesic motion around a rotating spherical object, we show that these corrections are minimal and are not expected to be the origin of the Flyby Anomaly, unless conformal parameters are drastically different from current estimates. Therefore, our results confirm previous analyses, showing that modifications due to Conformal Gravity are not likely to be detected at the Solar System level, but might affect gravity at the galactic or cosmological scale.
With the objective to find a solution to the cosmological constant and the coincidence problems, we consider a cosmological model where the dark sectors are interacting together through a phenomenological decay law <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\dot{\rho }_\mathrm{\Lambda }=Q\rho _\mathrm{\Lambda }^n\)</span> in a FRW spacetime with spatial curvature. We show that the only value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n\)</span> for which the late-time matter energy density to dark energy density ratio (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(r\mathrm{_m}=\rho _\mathrm{m}/\rho _\mathrm{\Lambda }\)</span>) is constant (which could provide an explanation to the coincidence problem) is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(n=3/2\)</span>. For each value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(Q\)</span>, there are two distinct solutions. One of them involves a spatial curvature approaching zero at late times (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\rho _\mathrm{k}\approx 0\)</span>) and is stable when the interaction is weaker than a critical value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\({Q_0=-\sqrt{32\pi G/c^2}}\)</span>. The other one allows for a non-negligible spatial curvature (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\rho _\mathrm{k}\not \approx 0\)</span>) at late times and is stable when the interaction is stronger than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(Q_0\)</span>. We constrain the model parameters using various observational data (SNeIa, GRB, CMB, BAO, OHD). The limits obtained on the parameters exclude the regions where the cosmological constant problem is significantly ameliorated and do not allow for a completely satisfying explanation for the coincidence problem.
It has been only <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sim \)</span>15 years since the discovery of dark energy (although some may argue there were strong indications even earlier). In the short time since measurements of type Ia supernovae indicated an accelerating universe, many other techniques have now confirmed the acceleration is real. The variety of ways in which dark energy has been confirmed is one of the reasons we are so confident in the statement that most of the energy in the universe is in a form we can not see except through its gravitational influence. This review aims to summarise briefly the many varied ways we now have measured dark energy. The fact that these different techniques all indicate that the simplest model remains the best—that dark energy contributes a constant background acceleration—is remarkable, since each of these different types of measurements represented opportunities for this simplest model to fail. Although we currently lack a compelling theoretical explanation for this acceleration, any explanation will have to explain the wide variety of complementary observations that we review here. This is an informal presentation, following the lines of the talk I presented at the General Relativity and Gravitation (GR20) conference in Warsaw in July 2013.
In this article I review the progress made in understanding the binary in spiral problem using Effective Field Theory technology.
We study the cosmological reconstruction of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R,T)\)</span> gravity (where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(T\)</span> denote the Ricci scalar and trace of the energy–momentum tensor) corresponding to the evolution background in FRW universe. It is shown that any cosmological evolution including <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda \)</span> cold dark matter, phantom or non-phantom eras and possible phase transition from decelerating to accelerating can be reproduced in this theory. We propose some specific forms of Lagrangian in the perspective of de Sitter and power law expansion history. Finally, we formulate the perturbed evolution equations and analyze the stability of some important solutions.

The solution is static, axisymmetric, electrovac, and flat at infinity. It has an isolated source. Both the electric and gravitational fields are zero on the symmetry axis near the source. An explanation is offered.
A non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis has been done for the interacting dark fluid in the universe bounded by the event horizon. From observational evidences it is assumed that at present the matter in the universe is dominated by two dark sectors-dark matter and dark energy (DE). The mutual interaction among them results in spontaneous heat flow between the horizon and the fluid system and the thermal equilibrium will no longer hold. In the present work, the dark matter is chosen in the form of dust while the DE is chosen as a perfect fluid with constant equation of state in one case and holographic DE model is chosen in the other. Finally, validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been examined in both cases.
The canonical quantization of the modified geodetic brane cosmology which is implemented from the Regge–Teitelboim model and the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the brane trajectory, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(K\)</span>, is developed. As a second-order derivative model, on the grounds of the Ostrogradski Hamiltonian method and the Dirac’s scheme for constrained systems, we find suitable first- and second-class constraints which allow for a proper quantization. We also find that the first-class constraints obey a sort of truncated Virasoro algebra. The effective quantum potential emerging in our approach is exhaustively studied where it shows that an embryonic epoch is still present. The quantum nucleation is sketched where we observe that it is driven by an effective cosmological constant.
In this work we study the geodesic motion on a noncommutative space–time. As a result we find a non-commutative geodesic equation and then we derive corrections of the deviation angle per revolution in terms of the non-commutative parameter when we specify the problem of Mercury’s perihelion. In this way, we estimate the noncommutative parameter based in experimental data.
In this paper we study the late evolution of Relic Gravitational Waves in coupled dark energy models, where dark energy interacts with cold dark matter. Relic Gravitational Waves are second tensorial order perturbations of the Lemaitre–Friedman–Robertson–Walker metric and experiment an evolution ruled by the scale factor of the metric. We find that the amplitude of Relic Gravitational Waves is smaller in coupled dark energy models than in models with non interacting dark energy. We also find that the amplitude of the waves predicted by the models with coupling term proportional to the dark energy density is smaller than those of the models with coupling term proportional to dark matter density.
The cosmological model consisting of a nonlinear magnetic field obeying the Lagrangian <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal {L}= \gamma F^{\alpha },\, F\)</span> being the electromagnetic invariant, coupled to a Robertson-Walker geometry is tested with observational data of Type Ia Supernovae, Long Gamma-Ray Bursts and Hubble parameter measurements. The statistical analysis show that the inclusion of nonlinear electromagnetic matter is enough to produce the observed accelerated expansion, with not need of including a dark energy component. The electromagnetic matter with abundance <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varOmega _B\)</span>, gives as best fit from the combination of all observational data sets <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varOmega _B=0.562^{+0.037}_{-0.038}\)</span> for the scenario in which <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\alpha =-1, \varOmega _B=0.654^{+0.040}_{-0.040}\)</span> for the scenario with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\alpha =-1/4\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\varOmega _B=0.683^{+0.039}_{-0.043}\)</span> for the one with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\alpha =-1/8\)</span>. These results indicate that nonlinear electromagnetic matter could play the role of dark energy, with the theoretical advantage of being a mensurable field.
The Misner space is a simplified 2-dimensional model of the 4-dimensional Taub-NUT space that reproduces some of its pathological behaviours. In this paper we provide an explicit base of the topology of the complete Misner space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathbb {R}^{1,1}/boost\)</span>. Besides we prove that some parts of this space, that behave like topological boundaries, are equivalent to the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(g\)</span>-boundaries of the Misner space.
The wave equation and equations of covariantly-constant vector fields (CCVF) in spaces with Weyl nonmetricity turn out to possess, in addition to the canonical conformal-gauge, a gauge invariance of another type. On a Minkowski metric background, the CCVF system alone allows us to pin down the Weyl 4-metricity vector, identified herein with the electromagnetic potential. The fundamental solution is given by the ordinary Lienard–Wiechert field, in particular, by the Coulomb distribution for a charge at rest. Unlike the latter, however, the magnitude of charge is necessarily unity, “elementary”, and charges of opposite signs correspond to retarded and advanced potentials respectively, thus establishing a direct connection between the particle/antiparticle asymmetry and the “arrow of time”.

We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker scenario with two interacting components, dark matter and variable vacuum energy densities, plus two decoupled components, one is a baryon term while the other behaves as a radiation component. We consider a linear interaction in the derivative dark component density. We apply the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\chi ^2\)</span> method to the observational Hubble data for constraining the cosmological parameters and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation era for the model. It turns out that our model fulfills the severe bound of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Omega _{x}(z\simeq 1{,}100)&lt;0.009\)</span> at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(2\sigma \)</span> level, so is consistent with the recent analysis that include cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from Planck survey, the future constraints achievable by Euclid and CMBPol experiments, reported for the behavior of the dark energy at early times, and fulfills the stringent bound <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Omega _{x}(z\simeq 10^{10})&lt;0.04\)</span> at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(2\sigma \)</span> level in the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch. We also examine the cosmic age problem at high redshift associated with the old quasar APM 08279+5255 and estimate the age of the universe today.
We provide a detailed comparison of the different approaches available for the quantization of a totally constrained system with a constraint algebra generating the non-compact <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(SL(2,\mathbb {R})\)</span> group. In particular, we consider three schemes: the Refined Algebraic Quantization, the Master Constraint Programme and the Uniform Discretizations approach. For the latter, we provide a quantum description where we identify semiclassical sectors of the kinematical Hilbert space. We study the quantum dynamics of the system in order to show that it is compatible with the classical continuum evolution. Among these quantization approaches, the Uniform Discretizations provides the simpler description in agreement with the classical theory of this particular model, and it is expected to give new insights about the quantum dynamics of more realistic totally constrained models such as canonical general relativity.
This paper summarizes parallel session C1: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Pulsar Timing Arrays</em> of the Amaldi10/GR20 Meeting held in Warsaw, Poland in July 2013. The session showcased recent results from pulsar timing array collaborations, advances in modelling the gravitational-wave signal, and new methods to search for and characterize gravitational waves in pulsar timing array observations.
In this paper we summarise the presentations given during the “Education and Public Outreach on Gravitational-Wave Astronomy” parallel session at the GR-20/Amaldi conference, held in Warsaw, July 2013. The talks presented demonstrate the wide range of education and public outreach activities being undertaken in the field of gravitational-wave astronomy—across science festivals, science education centers, junior schools and high schools, colleges and universities, via both face-to-face delivery and (increasingly) the internet and social media.
The Amaldi 10 Parallel Session C3 on Advanced Gravitational Wave detectors gave an overview of the status and several specific challenges and solutions relevant to the instruments planned for a mid-decade start of observation. Invited overview talks for the Virgo, LIGO, and KAGRA instruments were complemented by more detailed discussions in presentations and posters of some instrument features and designs.
We show that many standard results of Lorentzian causality theory remain valid if the regularity of the metric is reduced to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(C^{1,1}\)</span>. Our approach is based on regularisations of the metric adapted to the causal structure.
We consider equations of modified gravity involving critical accelerations and find its solutions for the point-like source by suggesting the appropriate symmetry of metrics in the empty space-time.
We explore a cyclic universe due to phantom and quintessence fields. We find that, in every cycle of the evolution of the universe, the phantom dominates the cosmic early history and quintessence dominates the cosmic far future. In this model of universe, there are infinite cycles of expansion and contraction. Different from the inflationary universe, the corresponding cosmic space-time is geodesically complete and quantum stable. But similar to the Cyclic Model, the flatness problem, the horizon problem and the large scale structure of the universe can be explained in this cyclic universe.
In this paper, we consider a modified gravity model in FRW cosmology, when our action is coupled by Weyl tensor and an arbitrary <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(R)\)</span> function. It indicates the emergence of the bouncing solution in the model, while the equation of state parameter crosses the phantom divider. In this research, cosmological usage of the most promising candidate of dark energy in the framework of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(R)\)</span> theory is explored when it is coupled by a Weyl tensor. A <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(f(R)\)</span> gravity model in the spatially flat FRW universe according to the ordinary version of the holographic dark energy model describing accelerated expansion of the universe, is reconstructed. Our model’s equation of state parameter will be obtain. We conclude that the holographic and Weyl gravity models can behave like phantom and quintessence models, whereas the equation of state parameter of the models can transit from quintessence state to phantom regime.
More than half a century after the Chapel Hill meeting of 1957, the landscape of general relativity has been transformed. In relativistic cosmology we are entering an era in which we can seriously consider testing some of the most fundamental assumptions that go into our view of the Universe. We propose that precision tests of gravity on cosmological scales may be feasible with up-and-coming surveys of galaxies. To achieve the most accurate general constraints yet we briefly describe a formalism which is applicable on the largest scales: the parametrized post-Friedmann approach. We sketch out the steps that need to be taken to link realistic, cosmological observables with fundamental properties of general relativity.
In this paper we study a new inflation potential proposed in Belhaj et al. (Int J Mod Phys D 17:911–920, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17">2008</a></span>), in the presence of a scalar field which interacts nonminimally with gravity. We present new constraints on the scalar spectral index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n_{s}\)</span>, the tensor-to-scalar ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r\)</span> and running of the spectral index <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\frac{dn_{s}}{ d\ln (k)}\)</span> from the recent data obtained by the Planck and BICEP2 experiment. The slow-roll parameters are reformulated in the case of a nonminimally coupled scalar field. We show that for parameter spaces of the models, inflation can occur at field values far below the four-dimensional Planck scale. We show also that for small and positive values of the nonminimal coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\xi \)</span>, the observational consequences of this model are in perfect compatibility with the latest observations data especially for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(N=50\)</span>.
We investigate the quasinormal modes of a test massless, minimally coupled scalar field on a static and spherically symmetric black hole in the scalar-tensor theory with field derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor, which is a part of the Horndeski theory with the shift symmetry. In our solution, the spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), where the effective AdS curvature scale is determined solely by the derivative coupling constant. The metric approaches the AdS spacetime in the asymptotic infinity limit and precisely recovers the Schwarzschild–AdS solution in general relativity if the coupling constant is tuned to the inverse of the cosmological constant. We numerically find the lowest lying quasinormal frequency for the perturbation about a test massless, minimally coupled scalar field. The quasinormal frequency agrees with that of the Schwarzschild–AdS solution for the tuned case. For other parameters, in the large black hole limit, as the metric coincides with that of the Schwarzschild–AdS black hole, the quasinormal frequency almost agrees with that of the Schwarzschild–AdS black hole and is insensitive to the value of the cosmological constant. On the other hand, for a small back hole the real part of the quasinormal frequency decreases as the absolute value of the cosmological constant increases.
The present work deals with dynamics of gravitational collapse with cylindrical symmetry as developed by Misner and Sharp. The interior collapsing anisotropic cylindrical perfect fluid is matched to an exterior vacuum cylindrically symmetric space-time due to Einstein–Rosen using the Darmois matching conditions. It is found that the radial pressure of the anisotropic perfect fluid is non-zero on the boundary surface and is related to the components of shear viscosity. As a result, there is formation of gravitational waves outside the collapsing matter.
The generic non-extremal Kerr–Newman black holes are holographically dual to hidden conformal field theories in two different pictures. The two pictures can be merged together to the dual conformal field theories (CFTs) in general picture that are generated by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(SL(2,\mathbb {Z})\)</span> modular group. We find some extensions of the conformal symmetry generators that yield an extended local family of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(SL(2,\mathbb {R})_L \times SL(2,\mathbb {R})_R\)</span> hidden conformal symmetries for the Kerr–Newman black holes, parameterized by one deformation parameter. The family of deformed hidden conformal symmetry for Kerr–Newman black holes also provides a set of deformed hidden conformal symmetry for the charged Reissner–Nordstrom black holes. The set of deformed hidden conformal generators reduce to the hidden <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(SL(2,\mathbb {R})\)</span> conformal generators for the Reissner–Nordstrom black hole for specific value of deformation parameter. We also find agreements between the macroscopic and microscopic entropy and absorption cross-section of scalars for the Kerr–Newman black hole by considering the appropriate temperatures and central charges for the deformed CFTs.
We investigate the geometrical aspects of the extended (2+1) dimensional Banados–Teitelboim–Zanelli spacetimes in the multiply warped product scheme. To do this, we analyze the interior physical properties by constructing the explicit warp functions in these regions.
It is shown that among the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R+\beta S^{abc}S_{abc}\)</span> models, only the one with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\beta =1/2\)</span> has nonvanishing torsion effect in the Robertson–Walker universe filled with a spin fluid, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(S_{abc}\)</span> denotes torsion. Moreover, the torsion effect in that model is found to be able to replace the big-bang singularity by a big bounce. Furthermore, we find that the model can be obtained under a Kaluza–Klein-like ansatz, by assuming that the gravitational gauge group is the de Sitter group.
We investigate the features of the non-corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum and the quantum corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum. We find that: (1) using the quantum corrected non-thermal spectra, the black hole radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process, and thus black hole evaporation process is unitary; (2) there are no obvious differences between all spectra except for near the Planck mass scale by comparing their average emission energies, average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations; (3) the energy covariances of Hawking radiations for all the thermal spectra are exactly zero, while they are nontrivial for all the non-thermal spectra. Especially, there are distinctly different maximums of energy covariances for the temperature-corrected and energy-corrected non-thermal spectra. Consequently, these differences provide a possible way towards experimentally analyzing whether the radiation spectrum of black hole is thermal or non-thermal with or without high order quantum corrections.
The analysis of axisymmetric spacetimes, dynamical or stationary, is usually made in the reduced space. We prove here a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">stability property</em> of the quotient space and use it together with minimal surface techniques to constraint the shape of General Relativistic bodies in terms of their energy and rotation. These constraints are different in nature to the mechanical limitations that a particular material body can have and which can forbid, for instance, rotation faster than a certain rate, (after which the body falls apart). The relations we are describing instead are fundamental and hold for all bodies, albeit they are useful only in General Relativistic regimes. For Neutron stars they are close to be optimal, and, although precise models for these stars display tighter constraints, our results are significative in that they do not depend on the equation of state.

Electrically charged dust is considered in the framework of Einstein–Maxwell–dilaton gravity with a Lagrangian containing the interaction term <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(P(\chi )F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu }\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(P(\chi )\)</span> is an arbitrary function of the dilaton scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\chi \)</span>, which can be normal or phantom. Without assumption of spatial symmetry, we show that static configurations exist for arbitrary functions <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(g_{00} = \exp (2\gamma (x^{i}))\)</span> (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(i=1,2,3\)</span>) and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\chi =\chi (\gamma )\)</span>. If <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\chi = \mathrm{const}\)</span>, the classical Majumdar–Papapetrou (MP) system is restored. We discuss solutions that represent black holes (BHs) and quasi-black holes (QBHs), deduce some general results and confirm them by examples. In particular, we analyze configurations with spherical and cylindrical symmetries. It turns out that cylindrical BHs and QBHs cannot exist without negative energy density somewhere in space. However, in general, BHs and QBHs can be phantom-free, that is, can exist with everywhere nonnegative energy densities of matter, scalar and electromagnetic fields.
Classical invariants of General Relativity can be used to approximate the entropy of the gravitational field. In this work, we study two proposed estimators based on scalars constructed out from the Weyl tensor, in Kerr spacetime. In order to evaluate Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol’s proposal, we calculate the gravitational energy density, gravitational temperature, and gravitational entropy of the Kerr spacetime. We find that in the frame we consider, Clifton et al.’s estimator does not reproduce the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of a Kerr black hole. The results are compared with previous estimates obtained by the authors using the Rudjord–Gr<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varnothing \)</span>n–Hervik approach. We conclude that the latter represents better the expected behaviour of the gravitational entropy of black holes.
In order to study the gravitational collapse of charged matter we analyze the simple model of an self-gravitating massless scalar field coupled to the electromagnetic field in spherical symmetry. The evolution equations for the Maxwell–Klein–Gordon sector are derived in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(3+1\)</span> formalism, and coupled to gravity by means of the stress–energy tensor of these fields. To solve consistently the full system we employ a generalized Baumgarte–Shapiro–Shibata–Nakamura formulation of General Relativity that is adapted to spherical symmetry. We consider two sets of initial data that represent a time symmetric spherical thick shell of charged scalar field, and differ by the fact that one set has zero global electrical charge while the other has non-zero global charge. For compact enough initial shells we find that the configuration doesn’t disperse and approaches a final state corresponding to a sub-extremal Reissner–Nördstrom black hole with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(|Q|&lt;M\)</span>. By increasing the fundamental charge of the scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(q\)</span> we find that the final black hole tends to become more and more neutral. Our results support the cosmic censorship conjecture for the case of charged matter.
We summarise the parallel session C7 <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Multi-Messenger Astronomy of GW Sources</em> in the GR20 Amaldi 10 Conference. The talks in this session covered a wide range of topics in multi-messenger astronomy.
The inspiral and merger of two orbiting black holes is among the most promising sources for the first (hopefully imminent) direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs), and measurements of these signals could provide a wealth of information about astrophysics, fundamental physics and cosmology. Detection and measurement require a theoretical description of the GW signals from all possible black-hole-binary configurations, which can include complicated precession effects due to the black-hole spins. Modelling the GW signal from generic precessing binaries is therefore one of the most urgent theoretical challenges facing GW astronomy. This article briefly reviews the phenomenology of generic-binary dynamics and waveforms, and recent advances in modelling them.
We extend the cosmological couplings proposed in Sun et al. and Wei, where they suggested interactions with change of signs along the cosmological evolution. Our extension liberates the changes of sign of the interaction from the deceleration parameter and from the relation of energy densities of the dark sector and considers the presence of non interactive matter. In three cases we obtain the general solutions and the results obtained in models fitted with Hubble’s function and SNe Ia data, are analyzed regarding the problem of the cosmological coincidence, the problem of the crisis of the cosmological age and the magnitude of the energy density of dark energy at early universe. Also we graphically study the range of variation of, the actual dark matter density parameter, the effective equation of state of the dark energy and the redshift of transition to the accelerated regimen, generated by variations at order <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1\sigma \)</span> in the coupling parameters.
We show within the usual two-dimensional approximation that unitarity and the restoration of Minkowski vacuum correlations at the end of black hole evaporation impose unexpected constraints on its mass loss rate: before disappearing the black hole emits one or more negative energy burst, leading to a temporary increase of its mass.
We study the behaviour of the density contrast in quasi-spherical Szekeres spacetime and derive its analytical behaviour as a function of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(t\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r\)</span>. We set up the inhomogeneity using initial data in the form of one extreme value of the density and the radial profile. We derive conditions for density extremes that are necessary for avoiding the shell crossing singularity and show that in the special case of a trivial curvature function, the conditions are preserved by evolution. We also show that in this special case if the initial inhomogeneity is small, the time evolution does not influence the density contrast, however its magnitude homogeneously decreases.
Observed rotational curves of neutral hydrogen clouds strongly support the fact that galactic halo contains huge amount of nonluminous matter, the so called gravitational dark matter. The nature of dark matter is a point of debate among the researchers. Recent observations reported the presence of ions of O, S, C, Si etc. in the galactic halo and intergalactic medium. This supports the possibility of existence of electric field in the galactic halo region. We therefore propose a model of galactic halo considering this electric field arising due to charged particles as one of the inputs for the background spacetime metric. Considering dark matter as an anisotropic fluid we obtain the expressions for energy density and pressure of dark matter there and consequently the equation of state of dark matter. Various other aspects of the solutions are also analyzed along with a critical comparison with and constraints of different observational evidences.
In this paper we perform a systematic classification of the regimes of cosmological dynamics in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity with generic values of the coupling constants. We consider a manifold which is a warped product of a four dimensional Friedmann–Robertson–Walker space-time with a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D\)</span>-dimensional Euclidean compact constant curvature space with two independent scale factors. A numerical analysis of the time evolution as function of the coupling constants and of the curvatures of the spatial section and of the extra dimension is performed. We describe the distribution of the regimes over the initial conditions space and the coupling constants. The analysis is performed for two values of the number of extra dimensions (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D\geqslant 6\)</span> both) which allows us to describe the effect of the number of the extra dimensions as well.
Present work is a study of a particular two brane model in 5-dim, in which a primordial scalar field (living in the hidden brane) reproduces inflation effects for very early times. By using a novel ansatz, we obtain a set of solutions that are topological dependent and establish restrictions over the evolution in each brane. An important aspect to consider is the scale of compactification, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R\)</span> in the evolution equations, therefore two limits are studied: first when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(R\)</span> is negligible, and later with the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(R\)</span> contribution playing an important roll in the adjusted parameters to obtain <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(N_0\approx 70\)</span> e-foldings. As a result of having inflationary solutions in the hidden brane, similar behavior is reflected in our brane due to the constraint equations.
We explore the multi-black hole spacetimes from the perspective of the ultra-high energy particle collisions. Such a discussion is limited to the spacetimes containing a single black hole so far. We deal with the Majumdar–Papapetrou solution representing a system consisting of two identical black holes in the equilibrium. In order to identify the conditions suitable for the process of high energy collisions, we consider particles confined to move on the equatorial plane towards the axis of symmetry with the zero angular momentum. We consider collision between the particles moving in opposite directions at the location midway between the black holes on the axis. We show that the center of mass energy of collision between the particles increases with the decrease in the separation between the black holes and shows divergence in the limit where the separation goes to zero. We estimate the size of the region close to the central point on the equatorial plane where it would be possible to have high energy collisions and show that this region has a reasonably large spatial extent. We further explore the process of high energy collisions with the general geodesics with arbitrary angular momentum on the equatorial plane away from the central point. Although in this paper we deal with the Majumdar–Papapetrou spacetime which serves as a toy example representing multiple black holes, we speculate on the possibility that the ultra-high energy collisions would also occur in the more general setting like colliding black holes, when distance between the black holes is extremely small, which can in principle be verified in the numerical relativity simulations.
We determine the accuracy of the conformal flatness (IWM–CFC) approximation for the case of single, but strongly differentially rotating relativistic stars. We find that for the fastest rotating and most relativistic polytropic models, the deviation from full general relativity is below 5 % for integrated quantities and below 10 % for local quantities, such as the angular velocity. Furthermore, we study the deviation of the IWM–CFC approximation from full general relativity by evaluating and comparing different error indicators. We find that for the models that are not near the maximum mass, a simple error indicator constructed from local values of the metric potentials is more indicative of the accuracy of the IWM–CFC approximation than an error indicator that is based on the Cotton–York tensor. Furthermore, we construct a simple, linear empirical relation that allows for the estimation of the error made by the IWM–CFC approximation and which only involves the flattening of the star due to rotation and the minimum value of the lapse function. Thus, in any numerical simulation involving rotating relativistic stars, one can readily know the deviations from full general relativity due to the IWM–CFC approximation.
In this paper we investigate the constant volume exponential solutions (i.e. the solutions with the scale factors change exponentially over time so that the comoving volume remains the same) in the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity. We find conditions for these solutions to exist and show that they are compatible with any perfect fluid with the equation of state parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\upomega &lt;1/3\)</span> if the matter density of the Universe exceeds some critical value. We write down some exact solutions which generalize ones found in our previous paper for models with a cosmological constant.
A circular restricted three-body problem describes the motion of a test particle around two massive bodies in circular orbits. In this system, orbital decay caused by a gravitational radiation reaction between the two primary bodies is considered but the direct effect of gravitational radiation on the test particle is neglected. We adopt distance- and time-scale transformations to Newtonian problems so that systems without orbital decay will not depend on separation between the primaries but systems with orbital decay will depend on this separation. If a regular or chaotic orbit is given in a Newtonian system, the starting separation of the primaries varies according to the corresponding decay system. Thus, insights into the chaotic behaviour of a third body in a decay case are provided. For a large initial separation between the primaries, the chaos that exists in a Newtonian problem may be retained for a long enough time scale of dissipative evolution before the primaries coalesce. The final state of a third body is escape attributed to orbital decay.
A complete and simple invariant classification of the conformally flat pure radiation metrics with a negative cosmological constant that were obtained by integration using the generalised invariant formalism is presented. We show equivalence between these metrics and the corresponding type O subclass of the more general spacetime studied by Siklos. The classification procedure indicates that the metrics possess a one degree of null isotropy freedom which has very interesting repercussions in the symmetry analysis. The Killing and homothetic vector analysis in GHP formalism is then generalised to this case were there is only one null direction defined geometrically. We determine the existing Killing vectors for the different subclasses that arise in the classification and compare these results to those obtained in the symmetry analysis performed by Siklos for a larger class of metrics with Ricci tensor representing a pure radiation field and a negative cosmological constant. It is also shown that there are no homothetic Killing vectors present.
In this paper we show that in the presence of torsion and a metric with an antisymmetric part one can construct a gravitational analog of Faraday’s law of electromagnetism.
We reexamine and further develop different gravito-electromagnetic analogies found in the literature, and clarify the connection between them. Special emphasis is placed in two exact physical analogies: the analogy based on inertial fields from the so-called “1+3 formalism”, and the analogy based on tidal tensors. Both are reformulated, extended and generalized. We write in both formalisms the Maxwell and the full exact Einstein field equations with sources, plus the algebraic Bianchi identities, which are cast as the source-free equations for the gravitational field. New results within each approach are unveiled. The well known analogy between linearized gravity and electromagnetism in Lorentz frames is obtained as a limiting case of the exact ones. The formal analogies between the Maxwell and Weyl tensors are also discussed, and, together with insight from the other approaches, used to physically interpret gravitational radiation. The precise conditions under which a similarity between gravity and electromagnetism occurs are discussed, and we conclude by summarizing the main outcome of each approach.
We have solved the Einstein–Maxwell equations for a class of metrics with constant spatial curvature by considering only a primordial magnetic field as source. We assume a slight modification of the Tolman averaging relations so that the energy–momentum tensor of this field possesses an anisotropic pressure component. This inhomogeneous magnetic universe is isotropic and its time evolution is guided by the usual Friedmann equations. In the case of a flat universe, the space-time metric is free of singularities (except the well-known initial singularity at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\text {t} = 0\)</span>). It is shown that the anisotropic pressure of our model has a straightforward relation to the Weyl tensor. We then analyze the effect of this new ingredient on the motion of test particles and on the geodesic deviation of the cosmic fluid.
In this paper we deal with quadratic metric-affine gravity, which we briefly introduce, explain and give historical and physical reasons for using this particular theory of gravity. We then introduce a generalisation of well known spacetimes, namely pp-waves. A classical pp-wave is a 4-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime which admits a nonvanishing parallel spinor field; here the connection is assumed to be Levi-Civita. This definition was generalised in our previous work to metric compatible spacetimes with torsion and used to construct new explicit vacuum solutions of quadratic metric-affine gravity, namely <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">generalised</em> pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature. The physical interpretation of these solutions we propose in this article is that they represent a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conformally invariant metric-affine model for a massless elementary particle</em>. We give a comparison with the classical model describing the interaction of gravitational and massless neutrino fields, namely <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Einstein–Weyl theory</em> and construct pp-wave type solutions of this theory. We point out that generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature are very similar to pp-wave type solutions of the Einstein–Weyl model and therefore propose that our generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature represent a metric-affine model for the massless neutrino.
The paper summarizes the parallel session C6 <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q&amp;A—everything you wanted to know about gravitational waves but were afraid to ask</em> of the joint 10th Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves and 20th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation.
There are great expectations for the world-wide network of gravitational wave detectors currently under construction in United States, Europe and Japan. These multi-kilometer interferometers are seeking to make the first direct detection of gravitational waves and initiate a new era in astronomy and astrophysics in which we can <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">listen</em> to black holes, neutron stars and other enigmatic inhabitants of the local universe. Advanced detectors will be approximately 10 times more sensitive than the initial detectors, which were operational until 2011. As the detection volume for a given source is proportional to the cube of the sensitivity, detection rates will increase by roughly a factor of one thousand; rate estimates suggest a most probable level of tens of events per year once detectors reach design sensitivity. In this paper we give a general overview of the advanced detectors which will start producing astrophysically interesting data in 2015, and we discuss prospects for beginning the observation of the gravitational wave Universe within this decade.
The first generation of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors, LIGO, GEO and Virgo, have operated and taken data at their design sensitivities over the last few years. The data have been examined for the presence of gravitational wave signals. While no gravitational wave events have been found important astrophysical statements can be made. The most significant results are presented in this article. The network of detectors is currently being upgraded and extended. This upgrade will provide the sensitivity needed for the direct detection of an astrophysical source emitting gravitational waves. For instance, the binary neutron stars inspiral distance range will reach 200 Mpc when upgraded detectors reach their design sensitivities circa 2020. The capability of the global network to determine accurately the sky location of the source is opening a new window on the Universe, where gravitational alerts will be used for quick electro-magnetic follow-ups of the sources.
Using an action variable, the spectroscopy of a Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole is studied. It is found that the action variable is nothing but the entropy of the black hole. With the help of the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule, the entropy spectrum and the area spectrum are obtained and equally spaced. The spectroscopy of the near-extremal Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole is also studied. In addition, we confirm the universality of the spectroscopy for a black hole by the action variable exclusively.
We find the geometrical set of equations corresponding to the approximate Noether gauge symmetry conditions of the perturbed geodesic Lagrangian for spacetimes. Using the obtained new set of approximate Noether symmetry equations which involves exact, first-order and second-order metrics, we calculate exact, first-order and second-order approximate Noether gauge symmetry vectors of the geodesic Lagrangian for the potential function defining the dynamical system in spacetimes. We apply our geometrical method to each of the Schwarzschild metric and Reissner–Nordström metric.
We elaborate on a previous proposal by Hartman and Maldacena on a tensor network which accounts for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a system at a finite temperature. In this construction, the ordinary entanglement renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Multi Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz</em> (MERA), is supplemented by an additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature. The network comprises two copies of a MERA circuit with a fixed number of layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling the infrared degrees of freedom of both MERA networks. The entanglement distribution within this <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bridge</em> state defines reduced density operators on both sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The entanglement and correlations during the thermalization process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed. To this end, a full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on the bridge state is proposed. This amounts to a tensor network which grows in size by adding succesive layers of bridge states. Finally, we discuss on the holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution.
We construct a four-dimensional domain wall universe using the Brans–Dicke type gravity with two scalar fields. We give a formulation where for arbitrarily given warp and scale factors, we construct an action which reproduces both the warp and scale factors as a solution of the Einstein equation and the field equations given by the action. This formulation could be described as a reconstruction. We show that the model does not contain ghosts with negative kinetic term and that the localization of gravity occurs as in the Randall–Sundrum model. It should be noted that in the equation of the graviton, there appear extra terms related to the extra dimension, which might affect the fluctuations in the inflation epoch.
It is well-known that in the Newman–Penrose formalism the Riemann tensor can be expressed as a set of eighteen complex first-order equations, in terms of the twelve spin coefficients, known as Ricci identities. The Ricci tensor herein is determined via the Einstein equations. It is also known that the Dirac equation in a curved spacetime can be written in the Newman–Penrose formalism as a set of four first-order coupled equations for the spinor components of the wave-function. In the present article we suggest that it might be possible to think of the Dirac equations in the N–P formalism as a special case of the Ricci identities, after an appropriate identification of the four Dirac spinor components with four of the spin coefficients, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">provided torsion is included in the connection</em>, and after a suitable generalization of the energy-momentum tensor. We briefly comment on similarities with the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory. The motivation for this study is to take some very preliminary steps towards developing a rigorous description of the hypothesis that dynamical collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement is caused by gravity.
In this work we investigate the interaction between dark matter and dark energy for a coupling that obeys the Wang–Meng decaying law, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\rho _{\mathrm{DM}}\propto (1+z)^{3-\epsilon }\)</span>, and the Barboza–Alcaniz dark energy parametric model, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(w=w_0+w'_0z(1+z)/(1+z^2)\)</span>. Theoretically, we show that the coupling constant, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\epsilon \)</span>, should satisfy the physical constraint <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\epsilon \ge 0\)</span>. We use the most recent data of type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave background and the Hubble expansion rate function to constrain the free parameters of the model. From a purely observational point of view, we show that is not possible to discard values of the coupling constant in the unphysical region <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\epsilon &lt;0\)</span>. We show that the uncoupled case, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\epsilon =0\)</span>, is in better agreement with the data than any of coupled models in the physical region. We also find that all physically acceptable interaction in dark sector lies in the narrow range <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(0&lt;\epsilon \le 0.034\)</span> (95 % CL).
We investigate the generation of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation in the vicinity of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole. The gravitational perturbations and the electromagnetic field are studied by solving the Teukolsky master equation with sources, which we take to be locally charged, radially infalling, matter. Our results show that, in addition to the gravitational wave generated as the matter falls into the black hole, there is also a burst of electromagnetic radiation. This electromagnetic field has a characteristic set of quasinormal frequencies, and the gravitational radiation has the quasinormal frequencies of a Schwarzschild black hole. This scenario allows us to compare the gravitational and electromagnetic signals that are generated by a common source.
The null geodesics that describe photon orbits in the spacetime of a rotating electrically charged black hole (Kerr–Newman) are solved exactly including the contribution from the cosmological constant. We derive elegant closed form solutions for relativistic observables such as the deflection angle and frame dragging effect that a light ray experiences in the gravitational fields (i) of a Kerr–Newman black hole and (ii) of a Kerr–Newman–de Sitter black hole. We then solve the more involved problem of treating a Kerr–Newman black hole as a gravitational lens, i.e. a KN black hole along with a static source of light and a static observer both located far away but otherwise at arbitrary positions in space. For this model, we derive the analytic solutions of the lens equations in terms of Appell and Lauricella hypergeometric functions and the Weierstraßmodular form. The exact solutions derived for null, spherical polar and non-polar orbits, are applied for the calculation of frame dragging for the orbit of a photon around the galactic centre, assuming that the latter is a Kerr–Newman black hole. We also apply the exact solution for the deflection angle of an equatorial light ray in the gravitational field of a Kerr–Newman black hole for the calculation of bending of light from the gravitational field of the galactic centre for various values of the Kerr parameter, electric charge and impact factor. In addition, we derive expressions for the Maxwell tensor components for a zero-angular-momentum-observer (ZAMO) in the Kerr–Newman–de Sitter spacetime.
The rapid oscillating scalar field is considered as the quintessence in the framework of nonminimal kinetic coupling model. The scalar field behaves like a perfect fluid with a variable equation of state parameter which can be expressed as a function of the Hubble parameter. This feature enables us to study its evolution via continuity equation. The scalar field may behave as dark energy in the present epoch, while it behaves like dark matter in the future. This characteristic allows the occurrence of a decelerated expansion after the present acceleration, without invoking any interaction. The model is also studied in the presence of an interaction between dark sectors alleviating the coincidence problem. The stability of the model is investigated and the stable attractor solutions are studied.
We show that the equation of motion for a rigid one-dimensional elastic body (i.e. a rod or string whose speed of sound is equal to the speed of light) in a two-dimensional spacetime is simply the wave equation. We then solve this equation in a few simple examples: a rigid rod colliding with an unmovable wall, a rigid rod being pushed by a constant force, a rigid string whose endpoints are simultaneously set in motion (seen as a special case of Bell’s spaceships paradox), and a radial rigid string that has partially crossed the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole while still being held from the outside.
We obtain a constraint on cosmological scalars for the FRW metric with a pure radiation fluid source and positive cosmological constant. We demonstrate that this constraint is conformally invariant in the context of Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology proposal, where the metrics of the late stages of the previous aeon and the early stages of the present aeon are described by FRW cosmologies.
We consider gravity in four dimensions in the vielbein formulation, where the fundamental variables are a tetrad <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(e\)</span> and a SO(3,1) connection <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\omega \)</span>. We start with the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism invariance which includes, besides the standard Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the equations of motion, or are topological in nature. For our analysis we employ the covariant Hamiltonian formalism where the phase space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Gamma \)</span> is given by solutions to the equations of motion. We consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizons boundary conditions. For this extended action we study the effect of the topological terms on the Hamiltonian formulation. We prove two results. The first one is rather generic, applicable to any field theory with boundaries: The addition of topological terms (and any other boundary term) does not modify the symplectic structure of the theory. The second result pertains to the conserved Hamiltonian and Noether charges, whose properties we analyze in detail, including their relationship. While the Hamiltonian charges are unaffected by the addition of topological and boundary terms, we show in detail that the Noether charges <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">do</em> change. Thus, a non-trivial relation between these two sets of charges arises when the boundary and topological terms needed for a consistent formulation are included.
We present a maximum probability approach to reconstructing spatial maps of the peculiar velocity field at redshifts <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(z\sim 0.1\)</span>, where the velocities have been measured from distance indicators (DI) such as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D_n-\sigma \)</span> relations or Tully–Fisher. With the large statistical uncertainties associated with DIs, our reconstruction method aims to recover the underlying true peculiar velocity field by reducing these errors with the use of two physically motivated filtering prior terms. The first constructs an estimate of the velocity field derived from the galaxy over-density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\delta _g\)</span> and the second makes use of the matter linear density power spectrum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(P_k\)</span>. Using <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(N\)</span>-body simulations we find, with an SDSS-like sample (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(N_{gal}\simeq 33\)</span> per deg<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(^2\)</span> ), an average correlation coefficient value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(r=0.55\pm {0.02}\)</span> between our reconstructed velocity field and that of the true velocity field from the simulation. However, with a suitably high number density of galaxies from the next generation surveys (e.g. <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(N_{gal}\simeq 140\)</span> per deg<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(^2\)</span>) we can achieve an average <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(r=0.70\pm {0.02}\)</span> out to moderate redshifts <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(z\sim 0.1\)</span>. This will prove useful for future tests of gravity, as these relatively deep maps are complementary to weak lensing maps at the same redshift. LA-UR 12-24505.
The phenomenal rotational stability of millisecond pulsars allows them to be used as precise celestial clocks. An array of these pulsars can be exploited to search for correlated perturbations in their pulse times of arrival due to gravitational waves. Here, I describe the observations and analysis necessary to accomplish this goal and present an overview of the efforts of the worldwide pulsar timing community. Due to a growing number of millisecond pulsar discoveries, improved instrumentation, and growing timespans of observation, the sensitivity of our pulsar timing array experiments is expected to dramatically increase over the next several years, leading to either a gravitational wave detection or very stringent constraints on low-frequency gravitational wave source populations before the end of the decade.
CMB spectral distortions are induced by Compton collisions with electrons. We review the various schemes to characterize the anisotropic CMB with a non-Planckian spectrum. We advocate using logarithmically averaged temperature moments as the preferred language to describe these spectral distortions, both for theoretical modeling and observations. Numerical modeling is simpler, the moments are frame-independent, and in terms of scattering the mode truncation is exact.
A wormhole solution in Newtonian gravitation, enhanced through an equation relating the Ricci scalar to the mass density, is presented. The wormhole inhabits a spherically symmetric curved space, with one throat and two asymptotically flat regions. Particle dynamics in this geometry is studied, and the three distinct dynamical radii, namely, the geodesic, circumferential, and curvature radii, appear naturally in the study of circular motion. Generic motion is also analyzed. A limiting case, although inconclusive, suggests the possibility of having a Newtonian black hole in a region of finite (nonzero) size.
In the context of a canonical quantization of general relativity, one can deform the loop gravity phase space on a graph by replacing the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(T^*\mathrm{SU}(2)\)</span> phase space attached to each edge by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathrm{SL}(2,{\mathbb C})\)</span> seen as a phase space. This deformation is supposed to encode the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant.Here we show how to parametrize this phase space in terms of spinor variables, thus obtaining deformed spinor networks for loop gravity, with a deformed action of the gauge group <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathrm{SU}(2)\)</span> at the vertices. These are to be formally interpreted as the generalization of loop gravity twisted geometries to a hyperbolic curvature.
We consider metrics related to each other by functionals of a scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varphi (x)\)</span> and it’s gradient <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varvec{\nabla }\varphi (x)\)</span>, and give transformations of some key geometric quantities associated with such metrics. Our analysis provides useful and elegant geometric insights into the roles of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conformal</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-conformal</em> metric deformations in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varphi \)</span>-foliations. As a special case, we compare <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conformal</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">disformal</em> transforms to highlight some non-trivial scaling differences. We also study the geometry of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">equi-geodesic</em> surfaces formed by points <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(p\)</span> at constant geodesic distance <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\sigma (p,P)\)</span> from a fixed point <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(P\)</span>, and apply our results to a specific disformal geometry based on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\sigma (p,P)\)</span> which was recently shown to arise in the context of spacetime with a minimal length.
We have studied quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations of a black hole in massive gravity. The parameters of the theory, such as the mass of the black hole, the scalar charge of the black hole and the spherical harmonic index is varied to see how the corresponding quasinormal frequencies change. We have also studied the massive scalar field perturbations. Most of the work is done using WKB approach while sections are devoted to compute quasinormal modes via the unstable null geodesics approach and the Pöschl–Teller approximation. Comparisons are done with the Schwarzschild black hole.
A generalized Robertson–Walker spacetime is the warped product with base an open interval of the real line endowed with the opposite of its metric and base any Riemannian manifold. The family of generalized Robertson–Walker spacetimes widely extends the one of classical Robertson–Walker spacetimes. Further, generalized Robertson–Walker spacetimes appear as a privileged class of inhomogeneous spacetimes admitting an isotropic radiation.</p><p id="Par2" class="Para">In this section we prove a very simple characterization of generalized Robertson–Walker spacetimes; namely, a Lorentzian manifold is a generalized Robertson–Walker spacetime if and only if it admits a timelike concircular vector field.
Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of the hot plasma spots or clumps orbiting an accreting black hole contain information on the black hole mass and spin. The promising observational signatures for the measurement of black hole mass and spin are the latitudinal oscillation frequency of the bright spots in the accretion flow and the frequency of black hole event horizon rotation. Both of these frequencies are independent of the accretion model and defined completely by the properties of the black hole gravitational field. Interpretation of the known QPO data by dint of a signal modulation from the hot spots in the accreting plasma reveals the Kerr metric rotation parameter, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(a=0.65\pm 0.05\)</span>, and mass, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(M=(4.2\pm 0.2)10^6M_\odot \)</span>, of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center. At the same time, the observed 11.5 min QPO period is identified with a period of the black hole event horizon rotation, and, respectively, the 19 min period is identified with a latitudinal oscillation period of hot spots in the accretion flow. The described approach is applicable to black holes with a low accretion rate, when accreting plasma is transparent up to the event horizon region.
By adopting a metric based approach and making use of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)\)</span>-gravity extended tetrad equations, we have considered three spatially homogeneous metrics in order to investigate the existence of simultaneously rotating and expanding solutions of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(R)\)</span>-gravity field equations with shear-free perfect fluids as sources. We have shown that the Gödel type expanding universe, as well as a rotating Bianchi-type II spacetime allow no such solutions of the field equations of this modified gravity. On the other hand, we have found that there exist two types of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(R)\)</span> models in which a shear-free Bianchi-type IX universe can expand and rotate at the same time. The matter content of this universe is described by a perfect fluid having positive or negative pressure, depending on the type of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(f(R)\)</span> model and on the cosmological constant; in the particular case of a vanishing cosmological constant we have found that the universe is filled with a pure radiation. Whatsoever the cases, the universe exhibits always coasting anisotropic expansions along three spatial directions evolving like a flat Milne universe, and has a vorticity inversely proportional to cosmic time. A further result is that, due to the nonvanishing of the gravito-magnetic part of the Weyl tensor, this model allows for gravitational waves. Our solution constitutes one more example giving support to that in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(f(R)\)</span>-gravity there is no counterpart of the general relativistic shear-free conjecture.
In the framework of non-Riemannian geometry, we derive exact static vacuum solutions of the field equations obtained from the full equivalent version of the Einstein–Hilbert action when torsion degrees of freedom are taken into account. By imposing spherical symmetry and a suitable choice for the contorsion degrees of freedom, the static geometry provides deviations on the predictions of the observational tests predicted by General Relativity—namely on the advance of planetary perihelia and the bending of light rays—which we infer. The analytical extension is built in two particular domains of the parameter space. In the first domain we obtain a solution exhibiting an event horizon analogous to that of the Schwarzschild geometry. For the second domain, we show that the metric furnishes an exterior event horizon, and two interior horizons which enclose the singularity. For both branches we examine the effects of torsion corrections on the Hawking radiation. In this scenario the model extends Bekenstein’s black hole geometrical thermodynamics, with an extra work term connected to a torsion parameter.
We construct a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\textit{SU}}(2)\)</span> connection formulation of Kerr isolated horizons. As in the non-rotating case, the model is based on a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\textit{SU}}(2)\)</span> Chern–Simons theory describing the degrees of freedom on the horizon. The presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum modifies the admissibility conditions for spin network states. Physical states of the system are in correspondence with open intertwiners with total spin matching the angular momentum of the spacetime.
We analyze in detail conformally flat spherically symmetric fluid distributions, satisfying a polytropic equation of state. Among the two possible families of relativistic polytropes, only one contains models which satisfy all the required physical conditions. The ensuing configurations are necessarily anisotropic and show interesting physical properties. Prospective applications of the presented models to the study of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, are discussed.
The holographic principle is applied to a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker space-time dominated by dark energy when this is due to the presence of a k-essence scalar field, both for dark energy and phantom scenarios. In this framework, a geometrical covariant approach permits the construction of holographic hypersurfaces. The resulting covariant preferred screens, both for phantom and non-phantom regions, are then compared with those obtained by using the holographic dark energy model with the future event horizon as the infrared cut-off. In the phantom case, one of the two obtained holographic screens is placed on the big rip hypersurface, both for the covariant holographic formalism and the holographic phantom model. It is also analysed whether this covariant formalism allows a mathematically consistent formulation of fundamental theories based on the existence of a S-matrix at infinite distances.
Braneworld models may yield interesting effects ranging from high-energy physics to cosmology, or even some low-energy physics. Their mode structure modifies standard results in these physical realms that can be tested and used, for example, to set bounds on the models parameters. Now, to define braneworld deviations from standard 4D physics, a notion of matter and gravity localization on the brane is crucial. In this work we investigate the localization of universal massive scalar fields in a de Sitter thick tachyonic braneworld generated by gravity coupled to a tachyonic bulk scalar field. This braneworld possesses a 4D de Sitter induced metric and is asymptotically flat despite the presence of a negative bulk cosmological constant, a novel and interesting peculiarity that contrasts with previously known models. It turns out that universal scalar fields can be localized in this expanding braneworld if their bulk mass obeys an upper bound, otherwise the scalar fields delocalize: The dynamics of the scalar field is governed by a Schrödinger equation with an analog quantum mechanical potential of modified Pöschl–Teller type. This potential depends on the bulk curvature of the braneworld system as well as on the value of the bulk scalar field mass. For masses satisfying a certain upper bound, the potential displays a negative minimum and possesses a single massless bound state separated from the Kaluza–Klein (KK) massive modes by a mass gap defined by the Hubble (expansion scale) parameter of the 3-brane. As the bulk scalar field mass increases, the minimum of the quantum mechanical potential approaches a null value and, when the bulk mass reaches certain upper bound, it becomes positive (eventually transforming into a potential barrier), leading to delocalization of the bulk scalar field from the brane. We present analytical expressions for the general solution of the Schrödinger equation. Thus, the KK massive modes are given in terms of general Heun functions as well as the expression for the massless zero mode, giving rise to a new application of these special functions.
The parallel session C5 on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Space-Based Detectors</em> gave a broad overview over the planned space missions related to gravitational wave detection. Overviews of the revolutionary science to be expected from LISA was given by Alberto Sesana and Sasha Buchman. The launch of LISA Pathfinder (LPF) is planned for 2015. This mission and its payload “LISA Technology Package” will demonstrate key technologies for LISA. In this context, reference masses in free fall for LISA, and gravitational physics in general, was described by William Weber, laser interferometry at the pico-metre level and the optical bench of LPF was presented by Christian Killow and the performance of the LPF optical metrology system by Paul McNamara. While LPF will not yet be sensitive to gravitational waves, it may nevertheless be used to explore fundamental physics questions, which was discussed by Michele Armano. Some parts of the LISA technology that are not going to be demonstrated by LPF, but under intensive development at the moment, were presented by Oliver Jennrich and Oliver Gerberding. Looking into the future, Japan is studying the design of a mid-frequency detector called DECIGO, which was discussed by Tomotada Akutsu. Using atom interferometry for gravitational wave detection has also been recently proposed, and it was critically reviewed by Peter Bender. In the nearer future, the launch of GRACE Follow-On (for Earth gravity observation) is scheduled for 2017, and it will include a Laser Ranging Interferometer as technology demonstrator. This will be the first inter-spacecraft laser interferometer and has many aspects in common with the LISA long arm, as discussed by Andrew Sutton.
The observational evidence for the recent acceleration of the universe demonstrates that canonical theories of cosmology and particle physics are incomplete—if not incorrect—and that new physics is out there, waiting to be discovered. The most fundamental task for the next generation of astrophysical facilities is therefore to search for, identify and ultimately characterise this new physics. Here we highlight recent efforts along these lines, mostly focusing on ongoing work by CAUP’s Dark Side Team aiming to develop some of the science case and optimise observational strategies for forthcoming facilities. The discussion is centred on tests of the stability of fundamental couplings (since the provide a direct handle on new physics), but synergies with other probes are also briefly considered. The goal is to show how a new generation of precision consistency tests of the standard paradigm will soon become possible.
We construct the detection rate for particle detectors moving along non-inertial trajectories and interacting with quantum fields. The detectors described here are characterized by the presence of records of observation throughout their history, so that the detection rate corresponds to directly measurable quantities. This is in contrast to past treatments of detectors, which actually refer to probes, i.e., microscopic systems from which we extract information <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">only after</em> their interaction has been completed. Our treatment incorporates the irreversibility due to the creation of macroscopic records of observation. The key result is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">real-time</em> description of particle detection and a rigorously defined time-local probability density function (PDF). The PDF depends on the scale <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sigma \)</span> of the temporal coarse-graining that is necessary for the formation of a macroscopic record. The evaluation of the PDF for Unruh–DeWitt detectors along different types of trajectory shows that only paths with at least one characteristic time-scale much smaller than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\sigma \)</span> lead to appreciable particle detection. Our approach allows for averaging over fast motions and thus predicts a constant detection rate for all fast periodic motions.
Can certain degrees of freedom of a closed physical system, described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, become more and more classical as they evolve from 1 some state? This question is important because our universe seems to have done just that! We construct an explicit, simple, example of such a system with just two degrees of freedom, of which one achieves ‘spontaneous classicalization’. It starts from a quantum state and under the usual Hamiltonian evolution, becomes more and more classical (in a well-defined manner in terms of the Wigner function) as time progresses. This is achieved without the usual procedures of integrating out a large number of environmental degrees of freedom or conventional decoherence. We consider different ranges of parameter space and identify the conditions under which spontaneous classicalization occurs in our model. The mutual interaction between the sub-systems of a larger system can indeed drive some of the subsystems to a classical configuration, with a phase space trajectory of evolution. We also argue that the results of our toy model may well be general characteristics of certain class of interacting systems. Several implications are discussed.
Spherically symmetric time-dependent solutions for the 5D system of a scalar field canonically coupled to gravity are obtained and identified as an extension of recent results obtained by Ahmed et al. (JHEP 1404:061. <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3576"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1312.3576</span></a></span> [hep-th], <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15">2014</a></span>). The corresponding cosmology of models with regularized branes generated by such a 5D scalar field scenario is also investigated. It has been shown that the anisotropic evolution of the warp factor and consequently the Hubble like parameter are both driven by the radial coordinate on the brane, which leads to an emergent thick brane-world scenario with spherically symmetric time dependent warp factor. Meanwhile, the separability of variables depending on fifth dimension, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(y\)</span>, which is exhibited by the equations of motion, allows one to recover the extra dimensional profiles obtained in Ahmed et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2014</a></span>), namely the extra dimensional part of the scale (warp) factor and the scalar field dependence on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(y\)</span>. Therefore, our results are mainly concerned with the time dependence of a spherically symmetric warp factor. Besides evincing possibilities for obtaining asymmetric stable brane-world scenarios, the extra dimensional profiles here obtained can also be reduced to those ones investigated in Ahmed et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2014</a></span>).
The possibility of matter coupling to two metrics at once is considered. This appears natural in the most general ghost-free, bimetric theory of gravity, where it unlocks an additional symmetry with respect to the exchange of the metrics. This double coupling, however, raises the problem of identifying the observables of the theory. It is shown that if the two metrics couple minimally to matter, then there is no physical metric to which all matter would universally couple, and that moreover such an effective metric generically does not exist even for an individual matter species. By studying point particle dynamics, a resolution is suggested in the context of Finsler geometry.
We will consider the most general least-order torsional completion of gravity with electrodynamics for the Dirac matter fields, and we study the effects that the torsion-spin coupling will have in inducing self-interactions among the fermion fields themselves; we will see that such self-interactions of fermions have effects analogous to those of the field-quantization prescription, and we will study the way in which they can give rise to matter distributions that are localized in a compact region and stable under the influence of perturbations.
In this work we study how a non-minimal coupling between matter and gravity can modify the structure of a homogeneous spherical body. The physical relevance of the adopted Lagrangian density is ascertained, with results obtained for two different choices of the latter.
We investigate the existence of black hole solutions of four dimensional <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\mathfrak {su}(N)\)</span> EYM theory with a negative cosmological constant. Our analysis differs from previous works in that we generalise the field equations to certain non-spherically symmetric spacetimes. The work can be divided into two sections. In the first half, we use theorems of Wang’s to derive a new topologically general <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\mathfrak {su}(N)\)</span>-invariant one-form connection which may serve as the ansatz for our gauge potential. The second half is devoted to proving the existence of non-trivial solutions to the field equations for any integer <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(N\)</span>, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(N-1\)</span> gauge degrees of freedom. Specifically, we prove existence in two separate regimes: for fixed values of the initial parameters and as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(|\varLambda |\rightarrow \infty \)</span>; and for any <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\varLambda &lt;0\)</span>, in some neighbourhood of existing trivial solutions. In both cases we can prove the existence of ‘nodeless’ solutions, i.e. such that all gauge field functions have no zeroes; this fact is of interest as we anticipate that some of them may be stable.
We study the time-like geodesic congruences, in the space-time geometry of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence. The nature of effective potential along with the structure of the possible orbits for test particles in view of the different values of quintessence parameter are analysed in detail. An increase in quintessence parameter is seen to set the particles from further distance into motion around black hole. The effect of quintessence parameter is investigated analytically wherever possible otherwise we perform the numerical analysis to probe the structure of possible orbits. It is observed that there exist a number of different possible orbits for a test particle in case of non-radial geodesics, such as circular (stable as well as unstable) bound orbits, radially plunge and fly-by orbits, whereas no bound orbits exist in case of radial geodesics.
We develop a new method in order to classify the Bianchi I spacetimes which admit Conformal Killing Vectors (CKVs). The method is based on two propositions which relate the CKVs of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+(\text {n}-1)\)</span> decomposable Riemannian spaces with the CKVs of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((\text {n}-1)\)</span> subspace and show that if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(1+(\text {n}-1)\)</span> space is conformally flat then the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((\text {n}-1)\)</span> spacetime is maximally symmetric. The method is used to study the conformal algebra of the Kasner spacetime and other less known Bianchi type I matter solutions of General Relativity.
We study the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(P\)</span>–<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(V\)</span> critical behaivor of N-dimensional AdS black holes in Einstein–Maxwell–power-Yang–Mills gravity. Our results show the existence of the Van der Waals like small-large black hole phase transitions when taking some special values of charges of the Maxwell and Yang–Mills fields. Further to calculate the critical exponents of the black holes at the critical point, we find that they are the same as those in the Van der Waals liquid-gas system.
We demonstrate the existence of a one-parameter family of initial data for the vacuum Einstein equations in five dimensions representing small deformations of the extreme Myers–Perry black hole. This initial data set has ‘<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(t-\phi ^i\)</span>’ symmetry and preserves the angular momenta and horizon geometry of the extreme solution. Our proof is based upon an earlier result of Dain and Gabach-Clement concerning the existence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(U(1)\)</span>-invariant initial data sets which preserve the geometry of extreme Kerr (at least for short times). In addition, we construct a general class of transverse, traceless symmetric rank 2 tensors in these geometries.
Two alternative theories to dark matter are investigated by testing their ability to describe consistently the dynamics of the Milky Way. The first one refers to a modified gravity theory having a running gravitational constant and the second assumes that dark matter halos are constituted by a Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC). The parameters of each model as well as those characterizing the stellar subsystems of the Galaxy were estimated by fitting the rotation curve of the Milky Way. Then, using these parameters, the vertical acceleration profile at the solar position was computed and compared with observations. The modified gravity theory overestimates the vertical acceleration derived from stellar kinematics while predictions of the BEC halo model are barely consistent with observations. However, a dark matter halo based on a collisionless fluid satisfies our consistency test, being the best model able to describe equally well the rotation curve and the vertical acceleration of the Galaxy.
The Amaldi 10 Parallel Session C2 on gravitational wave (GW) search results, data analysis and parameter estimation included three lively sessions of lectures by 13 presenters, and 34 posters. The talks and posters covered a huge range of material, including results and analysis techniques for ground-based GW detectors, targeting anticipated signals from different astrophysical sources: compact binary inspiral, merger and ringdown; GW bursts from intermediate mass binary black hole mergers, cosmic string cusps, core-collapse supernovae, and other unmodeled sources; continuous waves from spinning neutron stars; and a stochastic GW background. There was considerable emphasis on Bayesian techniques for estimating the parameters of coalescing compact binary systems from the gravitational waveforms extracted from the data from the advanced detector network. This included methods to distinguish deviations of the signals from what is expected in the context of General Relativity.
A new class of gravity–matter models defined in terms of two independent non-Riemannian volume forms (alternative generally covariant integration measure densities) on the space–time manifold are studied in some detail. These models involve an additional <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R^2\)</span> (square of the scalar curvature) term as well as scalar matter field potentials of appropriate form so that the pertinent action is invariant under global Weyl-scale symmetry. Scale invariance is spontaneously broken upon integration of the equations of motion for the auxiliary volume-form degrees of freedom. After performing transition to the physical Einstein frame we obtain: (1) an effective potential for the scalar field with two flat regions which allows for a unified description of both early universe inflation as well as of present dark energy epoch; (2) for a definite parameter range the model possesses a non-singular “emergent universe” solution which describes an initial phase of evolution that precedes the inflationary phase; (3) for a reasonable choice of the parameters the present model conforms to the Planck Collaboration data.
We show how two seemingly different theories with a scalar multiplicative coupling to electrodynamics are actually two equivalent parametrisations of the same theory: despite some differences in the interpretation of some phenomenological aspects of the parametrisations, they lead to the same physical observables. This is illustrated on the interpretation of observations of the cosmic microwave background.
By using the partial wave method, we investigate the absorption of Dirac field from the Bardeen regular black hole. We numerically carry out the absorption cross section, we find that the larger angular momentum quantum numbers <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(l\)</span> are, the smaller the corresponding maximum values of partial absorption cross section are. When the magnetic monopole charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\beta \)</span> increases, the absorption cross section and the power emission spectra of Hawking radiation increase, but the absorption probability and the luminosity decrease.
A common biquadratic potential for the Higgs field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(h\)</span> and an additional scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\phi \)</span>, non minimally coupled to gravity, is considered in a locally scale symmetric approach to standard model fields in curved spacetime. A common ground state of the two scalar fields exists and couples both fields to gravity, more precisely to Weyl geometric scalar curvature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(R\)</span>. In Einstein gauge (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\phi = \hbox {const}\)</span>, often called “Einstein frame”), also <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R\)</span> is scaled to a constant. This condition makes perfect sense, even in the general case, in the Weyl geometric approach. There it has been called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Weyl gauge</em>, because it was first considered by Weyl in the different context of his original scale geometric theory of gravity of 1918. Now it may get new meaning as a combined effect of electroweak theory and gravity, and their common influence on atomic frequencies.
An astrophysical (cosmological) black hole forming in a cosmological context will be subject to a flux of infalling matter and radiation, which will cause the outer apparent horizon (a marginal trapping surface) to be spacelike spacelike (Ellis et al., <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3577"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1407.3577</span></a></span>). As a consequence the radiation emitted close to the apparent horizon no longer arrives at infinity with a diverging redshift. Standard calculations of the emission of Hawking radiation then indicate that no blackbody radiation is emitted to infinity by the black hole in these circumstances, hence there will also then be no black hole evaporation process due to emission of such radiation as long as the matter flux is significant. The essential adiabatic condition (eikonal approximation) for black hole radiation gives a strong limit to the black holes that can emit Hawking radiation. We give the mass range for the black holes that can radiate, according to their cosmological redshift, for the special case of the cosmic blackbody radiation (CBR) influx (which exists everywhere in the universe). At a very late stage of black hole formation when the CBR influx decays away, the black hole horizon becomes first a slowly evolving horizon and then an isolated horizon; at that stage, black hole radiation will start. This study suggests that the primordial black hole evaporation scenario should be revised to take these considerations into account.
We study the cosmological evolution of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave in a resonant optical cavity placed to the expanding manifold described by the Robertson–Walker metric. Because of the Einstein principle of equivalence (EEP), one can find a local coordinate system (a local freely falling frame), in which spacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the Robertson–Walker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial coordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local time coordinate, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(X^0\)</span>. Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a straightforward implementation of EEP alone does not allow us to unambiguously decide whether atomic clocks based on quantum transitions of atoms, ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of a cavity. To resolve this ambiguity we have to analyse the cavity rigidity and the oscillation of its electromagnetic modes in an expanding universe by employing the full machinery of the Maxwell equations irrespectively of the underlying theory of gravity. We proceed in this way and found out that the size of the cavity and the electromagnetic frequency experience an adiabatic drift in conformal (unphysical) coordinates as the universe expands in accordance with the Hubble law. We set up the oscillation equation for the resonant electromagnetic modes, solve it by the WKB approximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their counterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock. The solution shows that there is a perfect mutual cancellation of the adiabatic drift of cavity’s frequency by space transformation to local coordinates and the time counted by the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of cavity has the same rate as that of atomic clocks. We conclude that if general relativity is correct and the local expansion of space is isotropic there should be no cosmological drift of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared to the frequency of atomic clocks. Continuous comparison of the frequency of the optical cavity resonator against that of atomic clock yields a powerful null test of the local isotropy of the Hubble expansion and the Einstein equivalence principle in cosmology.
We generalize Buchert’s averaged equations (Gen Relativ Gravit 32; 105, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">2000</a></span>; Gen Relativ Gravit 33; 1381, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2001</a></span>) to LRS class II dust model in the sense that all Einstein equations are averaged, not only the trace part. We derive the relevant averaged equations and we investigate backreaction on expansion and shear scalars in an approximate LTB model. Finally we propose a way to close the system of averaged equations.

We study a two 3-branes system embedded in a 5-dimensional spacetime with the fifth dimension compactified on a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(S^{1}/Z_{2}\)</span> orbifold. Assuming isotropic and homogeneous branes, we show that the dynamics of the visible brane affects the hidden brane through gravitational interaction. This influence is described by equations that relate the matter contents on each brane, and arise from the Israel’s junction conditions. We analyse the case in which both branes are composed of a single matter field with a vacuum bulk, and explore the different possibilities allowed for the cosmologies of the branes.
The scope of this paper is twofold. First, we derive rigorously a low-velocity and Galilei-covariant limit of the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) equations. Subsequently, these reduced GEM equations are coupled to the Schrödinger equation with gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic potentials. The resulting extended Schrödinger–Newton equations constitute a minimal model where the three fundamental constants of nature (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(G, \hbar \)</span>, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(c\)</span>) appear naturally. We show that the relativistic correction coming from the gravitomagnetic potential scales as the ratio of the mass of the system to the Planck mass, and that it reinforces the standard Newtonian (gravitoelectric) attraction. The theory is further generalized to many particles through a Wigner function approach.
A version of the vacuum conservation theorem is proved which does not assume the existence of a time function nor demands stronger properties than the dominant energy condition. However, it is shown that a stronger stable version plays a role in the study of compact Cauchy horizons.
We point out that there are solutions to the scalar wave equation on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+1\)</span> dimensional Minkowski space with finite energy tails which, if they reflect off a uniformly accelerated mirror due to (say) Dirichlet boundary conditions on it, develop an infinite stress-energy tensor on the mirror’s Rindler horizon. We also show that, in the presence of an image mirror in the opposite Rindler wedge, suitable compactly supported arbitrarily small initial data on a suitable initial surface will develop an arbitrarily large stress-energy scalar near where the two horizons cross. Also, while there is a regular Hartle–Hawking–Israel-like state for the quantum theory between these two mirrors, there are coherent states built on it for which there are similar singularities in the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor. We conjecture that in other situations with analogous <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">enclosed horizons</em> such as a (maximally extended) Schwarzschild black hole in equilibrium in a (stationary spherical) box or the (maximally extended) Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime, there will be similar stress-energy singularities and almost-singularities—leading to instability of the horizons when gravity is switched on and matter and gravity perturbations are allowed for. All this suggests it is incorrect to picture a black hole in equilibrium in a box or a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole as extending beyond the past and future horizons of a single Schwarzschild (/Schwarzschild-AdS) wedge. It would thus provide new evidence for ’t Hooft’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">brick wall</em> model while seeming to invalidate the picture in Maldacena’s ‘<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Eternal black holes in AdS</em>’. It would thereby also support the validity of the author’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis</em> and of the paper ‘<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Brick walls and AdS/CFT</em>’ by the author and Ortíz.
The purpose of this paper is two-fold. At first we will discuss the generation of source terms in the Einstein–Hilbert action by using (topologically complicated) compact 3-manifolds. There is a large class of compact 3-manifolds with boundary such as a torus given as the complement of a (thickened) knot admitting a hyperbolic geometry, denoted as hyperbolic knot complements in the following. We will discuss the fermionic properties of this class of 3-manifolds, i.e. we are able to identify a fermion with a hyperbolic knot complement. Secondly we will construct a large class of space-times, the exotic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathbb {R}}^{4}\)</span>, containing this class of 3-manifolds naturally. We begin with a topological trivial space, the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathbb {R}}^{4}\)</span>, and change only the differential structure to obtain many nontrivial 3-manifolds. It is known for a long time that exotic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathbb {R}}^{4}\)</span>’s generate extra sources of gravity (Brans conjecture) but here we will analyze the structure of these source terms more carefully. Finally we will state that adding a hyperbolic knot complement will result in the appearance of a fermion as source term in the Einstein–Hilbert action.
This paper analyses the cosmological consequences of a modified theory of gravity whose action integral is built from a linear combination of the Ricci scalar <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(R\)</span> and a quadratic term in the covariant derivative of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(R\)</span>. The resulting Friedmann equations are of the fifth-order in the Hubble function. These equations are solved numerically for a flat space section geometry and pressureless matter. The cosmological parameters of the higher-order model are fit using SN Ia data and X-ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters. The best-fit present-day <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(t_{0}\)</span> values for the deceleration parameter, jerk and snap are given. The coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\beta \)</span> of the model is not univocally determined by the data fit, but partially constrained by it. Density parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Omega _{m_0}\)</span> is also determined and shows weak correlation with the other parameters. The model allows for two possible future scenarios: there may be either an eternal expansion or a Rebouncing event depending on the set of values in the space of parameters. The analysis towards the past performed with the best-fit parameters shows that the model is not able to accommodate a matter-dominated stage required to the formation of structure.
The response of a test particle, both for the free case and under the harmonic oscillator potential, to circularly polarized gravitational waves is investigated in a noncommutative quantum mechanical setting. The system is quantized following the prescription in Saha and Gangopadhyay (Phys Lett B 681:96, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR49">2009</a></span>). An algebraic technique is then employed to solve the Hamiltonian of the system. The solutions, in both cases, show signatures of the coordinate noncommutativity. In the harmonic oscillator case, this NC effect plays a key role in altering the resonance point at which the system couples maximally with the GW. This feature, if observed in an experimental setting, will serve to determine the scale of spatial NC parameter. The applicability of our treatement and the relevance of our results to resonant bar detectors of GW are discussed.
The model of current-carrying string loop oscillations is tested to explain the special set of frequencies related to the high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed recently in the low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-407 containing a neutron star. The external geometry of the neutron star is approximated by the Kerr geometry, introducing errors not exceeding 10 % for slowly rotating massive neutron stars. The frequencies of the radial and vertical string loop oscillations are then governed by the mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M\)</span> and dimensionless spin <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(a\)</span> of the neutron star, and by the dimensionless parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\omega \)</span> describing combined effects of the string loop tension and its angular momentum. It is explicitly demonstrated that the string-loop oscillation model can explain the observed kHz frequencies for the neutron star parameters restricted to the intervals <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({0.2&lt;a&lt;0.4}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({2.1&lt;M/\mathrm{M}_{\odot }&lt;2.5}\)</span>. However, the stringy parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\omega \)</span> cannot be the same for all the three HF QPO observations in the XTE J1701-407 source; the limits on the acceptable values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\omega \)</span> are given in dependence on the spacetime parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(M\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(a\)</span>.
High precision superconductivity gravity gradiometers (SGG) are powerful tools for relativistic experiments. In this paper, we work out the tidal signals in non-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, which could be measured by orbiting SGGs around Earth. We find that, with proper orientations of multi-axes SGGs, the tidal signals from the Chern-Simons modification can be isolated in the combined data of different axes. Furthermore, for three-axes SGGs, such combined data is the trace of the total tidal matrix, which is invariant under the rotations of SGG axes and thus free from axis pointing errors. Following nearly circular orbits, the tests of the parity-violating Chern-Simons modification and the measurements of the gravitomagnetic sector in parity-conserving metric theories can be carried out independently in the same time. A first step analysis on noise sources is also included.
We present a class of conformally flat solutions of the Einstein’s field equations for spherical systems undergoing gravitational collapse accompanied with radial heat flux. The interior space-time of the collapsing matter is chosen to be conformal to the Robertson–Walker space-time so that its Weyl tensor vanishes identically. The conditions which ensure the smooth matching of the interior space-time of the collapsing system, across its boundary, with the exterior space-time of a radiating star which is described by Vaidya metric lead to an equation governing its overall subsequent evolution. New solutions of this equation have been shown to provide physically viable models of collapsing stars.
We obtain generalized Raychaudhuri equations for spinning test particles corresponding to congruences of particle’s world-lines, momentum, and spin. These are physical examples of the Raychaudhuri equation for a non-normalized vector, unit time-like vector, and unit space-like vector. We compute and compare the evolution of expansion-like parameters associated with these congruences for spinning particles confined in the equatorial plane of the Kerr space-time.
We establish versions of the positive mass and Penrose inequalities for a class of asymptotically hyperbolic hypersurfaces. In particular, under the usual dominant energy condition, we prove in all dimensions <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n\ge 3\)</span> an optimal Penrose inequality for certain graphs in hyperbolic space <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathbb {H}^{n+1}\)</span> whose boundary has constant mean curvature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(n-1\)</span>. This settles, for this class of manifolds, an inequality first conjectured by Wang (J Differ Geom 57(2):273–299, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR37">2001</a></span>).
In this paper, we investigate the background dynamics in brane cosmology when dark energy is coupled to dark matter by a suitable interaction. Here we consider an homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann–Robertson–Walker brane model and the evolution equations are reduced to an autonomous system by suitable transformation of variables. The nature of critical points are analyzed by evaluating the eigenvalues of linearized Jacobi matrix. Finally, the classical stability of the model is also studied.
We study the rotation curves of ultralight BEC dark matter halos. These halos are long lived solutions of initially rotating BEC fluctuations. In order to study the implications of the rotation characterizing these long-lived configurations we consider the particular case of a boson mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(m=10^{-23}\,\hbox {eV}/\hbox {c}^2\)</span> and no self-interaction. We find that these halos successfully fit samples of rotation curves of LSB galaxies.
We examine three-dimensional metric deformations based on a tetrad transformation through the action the matrices of scalar field. We describe by this approach to deformation the results obtained by Coll et al. (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 34:269, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15">2002</a></span>), where it is stated that any three-dimensional metric was locally obtained as a deformation of a constant curvature metric parameterized by a 2-form. To this aim, we construct the corresponding deforming matrices and provide their classification according to the properties of the scalar <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sigma \)</span> and of the vector <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathbf {s}\)</span> used in Coll et al. (Gen Relativ Gravit 34:269, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15">2002</a></span>) to deform the initial metric. The resulting causal structure of the deformed geometries is examined, too. Finally we apply our results to a spherically symmetric three geometry and to a space sector of Kerr metric.
The Janis–Newman algorithm is an old but very powerful tool to generate rotating solutions from static ones through a set of complex coordinate transformations. Several solutions have been derived in this way, including solutions with gauge fields. However, the transformation of the latter was so far always postulated as an ad hoc result. In this paper we propose a generalization of the procedure, extending it to the transformation of the gauge field. We also present a simplification of the algorithm due to G. Giampieri. We illustrate our prescription on the Kerr–Newman solution.
We conjecture an interpretation in terms of multipole moments of the obstructions to smoothness at infinity found for time-symmetric, conformally-flat initial data by Kroon (Commun Math Phys 244(1):133–156, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2004</a></span>).
I review the equations of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology given by Penrose (Cycles of time: an extraordinary new view of the universe. Bodley Head, London, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12">2010</a></span>). Motivated by the example of FRW cosmologies, I suggest a slight modification to Penrose’s prescription and show how this works out for Class A Bianchi cosmologies, and in general.
The aim of this work is to model the evolution of cosmic space based on thermodynamical parameters. The universe is considered to have an apparent horizon radius with a Kodama–Hayward temperature assigned to it. The method is founded on the fact proposed by Padmanabhan (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4916"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1206.4916</span></a></span>; Res Astro Astrophys 12:891 <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0505"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1207.0505</span></a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2012</a></span>) that the subtraction of the surface and bulk degrees of freedom provides information on the emergence of cosmic space. The fact of the matter is that in this approach the Raychaudhuri equation could even be obtained by the consideration of only thermodynamical parameters. As such, standard general relativity is taken as the starting point, where by implementing the standard cosmological equations, we obtain a generalized evolutionary equation supporting the emergence of cosmic space. The method proposed in this work can provide a basis for other cosmological models to have an emergent perspective.
In this paper, we use previously developed exact solutions to present some of the curious features of a force-free magnetosphere in a Kerr background. More precisely, we obtain a hitherto unseen timelike current in the force-free magnetosphere that does not flow along a geodesic. The electromagnetic field in this case happens to be magnetically dominated. Changing the sign of a single parameter in our solutions generates a spacelike current that creates an electromagnetic field that is electrically dominated.
We discuss a model of gravity coupled to a scalar field that admits exact cosmological solutions displaying an inflationary behavior at early times and a power-law expansion at late times. We study its general solutions and the effect of the inclusion of matter.
We consider collision of two particles near static electrically charged extremal black holes and elucidate the conditions under which the energy in the centre of mass frame <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span> grows unbounded. For a single black hole, we generalize the results obtained earlier for the Reissner–Nordström metric, to distorted black holes. In the multi-black hole space-time, qualitatively new features appear. If the point of collision is close to at least two horizons simultaneously, unbounded <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span> are possible (i) without fine-tuning of particles’ parameters, (ii) for an arbitrary mutual orientation of two velocities. Such a combination of properties (i) and (ii) has no analogues in the single black hole case and facilitates the condition of getting unbounded <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span>. Collisions in the electro-vacuum Majumdar–Papapetrou metric (several extremal black holes in equilibrium) is analyzed explicitly.
We obtain an approximate solution for the motion of a charged particle around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a weak dipolar magnetic field. We focus on eccentric bound orbits in the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild black hole and derive an analytic expression for the spectral distribution of the electromagnetic emission from a charged particle on such an orbit. Two sets of harmonic contributions appear, with specific frequency spacing. The expression can be written in compact form, if it is truncated up to the lowest order harmonic contributions.
This work is devoted to analyze the effects of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f(R)\)</span> model on the dynamics of dissipative shearing viscous and anisotropic spherical matter configuration. In this framework, we develop scalar functions and link their expressions with various physical parameters and inflationary <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f(R)\)</span> dark source terms. We also relate the Weyl tensor as well as other matter variables with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(R+{\epsilon }R^2\)</span> background and obtain evolution equations for shear and expansion scalars. We conclude that structure scalars and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(f(R)\)</span> higher curvature terms have significant importance in the dynamics of self-gravitating systems.
Incorporating effects of quantum gravity into the tunnelling method, we adopt the modified Dirac equation to study the tunnelling radiation of fermions in the Taub-NUT black hole. The corrected Hawking temperature is lower than the original temperature. The correction value is affected by the energy, mass and angular momentum of the emitted fermion. The quantum gravity correction slows down the increase of the temperature, which leads to the remnants left during the evaporation.
In this paper we study the thermodynamics and state space geometry of a set of regular black hole solutions such as Bardeen black hole (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1968</a></span>), Ayón-Beato and García black hole (Phys Rev Lett 80:5056, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1998</a></span>), Hayward black hole (Phys Rev Lett 96:031103, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2006</a></span>) and Berej–Matyjasek–Trynieki–Wornowicz black hole (Gen Relativ Gravit 38(5):885906, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">2006</a></span>). We find that all these black holes show second order thermodynamic phase transitions by observing discontinuities in heat capacity–entropy graphs as well as the cusp type double point in free energy–temperature graph. Using the formulation of geometrothermodynamics we again find the singularities in the heat capacity of the black holes by calculating the curvature scalar of the Legendre invariant metric.
We investigate all shear-free perfect fluid solutions of the Einstein field equations where the pressure and energy density satisfy a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\gamma \)</span>-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">law</em> equation of state with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\mu +p\ne 0\)</span>. We prove that such a fluid is either non rotating or non expanding. As a consequence, it follows by combining our result with those of Collins and Wainwright that any such shear-free perfect fluid which models either an expand universe or a collapsing star must in fact be a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker spacetime.
We analyze a class of physical properties, forming the content of the so-called von Zeipel theorem, which characterizes stationary, axisymmetric, non-selfgravitating perfect fluids in circular motion in the gravitational field of a compact object. We consider the extension of the theorem to the magnetohydrodynamic regime, under the assumption of an infinitely conductive fluid, both in the Newtonian and in the relativistic framework. When the magnetic field is toroidal, the conditions required by the theorem are equivalent to integrability conditions, as it is the case for purely hydrodynamic flows. When the magnetic field is poloidal, the analysis for the relativistic regime is substantially different with respect to the Newtonian case and additional constraints, in the form of PDEs, must be imposed on the magnetic field in order to guarantee that the angular velocity <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varOmega \)</span> depends only on the specific angular momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\ell \)</span>. In order to deduce such physical constraints, it is crucial to adopt special coordinates, which are adapted to the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\varOmega =\mathrm{const}\)</span> surfaces. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed.
A bi-connection modified gravity is considered in the presence of an additional Gauss–Bonnet term to standard Einstein–Hilbert action. The standard Einstein–Hilbert does not allow propagating additional degrees of freedom in bi-connection model. This fact makes the model exactly the same as standard general relativity with just one metric. In a general framework, we show the existence of Gauss–Bonnet term can solve this problem. Then we focus on bi-connection model in the Weyl framework which makes the analysis and the results more straightforward. In this framework there is a self-accelerating solution for the metric while the Weyl vector has a non-trivial dynamics. At last we show two independent realizations of de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity in the Weyl geometry framework. Though the potential term can mimic dRGT mass term but there is also mixing term between Riemann curvature tensor and the potential term.
A well-studied maximal gravitational point lens construction of S. H. Rhie produces <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(5n\)</span> images of a light source using <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n+1\)</span> deflector masses. The construction arises from a circular, symmetric deflector configuration on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(n\)</span> masses (producing only <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(3n+1\)</span> images) by adding a tiny mass in the center of the other mass positions (and reducing all the other masses a little bit). In a recent paper we studied this “image creating effect” from a purely mathematical point of view (Sète, Luce &amp; Liesen, Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 15(1), <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">2014</a></span>). Here we discuss a few consequences of our findings for gravitational microlensing models. We present a complete characterization of the effect of adding small masses to these point lens models, with respect to the number of images. In particular, we give several examples of maximal lensing models that are different from Rhie’s construction and that do not share its highly symmetric appearance. We give generally applicable conditions that allow the construction of maximal point lenses on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(n+1\)</span> masses from maximal lenses on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(n\)</span> masses.
Spacetime metrics describing ‘non-singular’ black holes are commonly studied in the literature as effective modification to the Schwarzschild solution that mimic quantum gravity effects removing the central singularity. Here we point out that to be physically plausible, such metrics should also incorporate the 1-loop quantum corrections to the Newton potential and a non-trivial time delay between an observer at infinity and an observer in the regular center. We present a modification of the well-known Hayward metric that features these two properties. We discuss bounds on the maximal time delay imposed by conditions on the curvature, and the consequences for the weak energy condition, in general violated by the large transversal pressures introduced by the time delay.
The thermodynamic behavior of a decaying vacuum cosmology describing the entire cosmological history evolving between two extreme (early and late time) de Sitter eras is investigated. The thermal evolution from the early de Sitter to the radiation phase is discussed in detail. The temperature evolution law and the increasing entropy function are analytically determined. The entropy of the effectively massless particles is initially zero but evolves continuously to the present day maximum value within the current Hubble radius, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(S_0 \sim 10^{88}\)</span> in natural units. By using the Gibbons–Hawking temperature relation for the de Sitter spacetime, it is found that the ratio between the primeval and the late time vacuum energy densities is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\rho _{vI}/\rho _{v0} \sim 10^{123}\)</span>, as required by some naive estimates from quantum field theory.
Stationary, inviscid, axisymmetric, rotating, transonic accretion flow has been studied in a general relativistic framework, in the Schwarzschild metric; for three different flow geometries—under both polytropic and isothermal conditions. The equilibrium points of the underlying fluid system have been located and an eigenvalue based linear dynamical systems analysis of these critical points has been carried out, to obtain a taxonomic scheme of the critical points. It has hence been shown that only saddle and centre type points can arise for real, physical transonic flow.
Universal thermodynamics for FRW model of the Universe bounded by apparent/event horizon has been considered for massive gravity theory. Assuming Hawking temperature and using the unified first law of thermodynamics on the horizon, modified entropy on the horizon has been determined. For simple perfect fluid with constant equation of state, generalized second law of thermodynamics and thermodynamical equilibrium have been examined on both the horizons.
The notion of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">reference frame</em> is a central theoretical construct for interpreting the physical implications of spacetime diffeomorphism invariance in General Relativity. However, the alternative formulation of classical General Relativity known as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Shape Dynamics</em> suggest that a subset of spacetime diffeomorphisms—namely hypersurface deformations—are, in a precise sense, dual to spatial conformal (or Weyl) invariance. Moreover, holographic gauge/gravity dualities suggest that bulk spacetime diffeomorphism invariance can be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">replaced</em> by the properties of boundary CFTs. How can these new frameworks be compatible with the traditional notion of reference frame so fundamental to our interpretation of General Relativity? In this paper, we address this question by investigating the classical case of maximally symmetric spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant. We find that it is possible to define a notion of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Shape Observer</em> that represents a conformal reference frame dual to the notion of inertial reference frame in spacetime and provide a precise dictionary relating the two notions. We explicitly calculate the Hamilton–Jacobi functional for a theory of reparametrization invariant shape configurations dual to a theory of free inertial observers in de Sitter. These Shape Observers are holographic in the sense that they are defined on the asymptotic conformal boundaries of spacetime but know about bulk physics, and show that the dual theory is conformally invariant at the classical level. This leads to a first principles derivation of an exact classical holographic correspondence that can easily be generalized to more complicated situations and may lead to insights regarding the interpretation of the conformal invariance manifest in Shape Dynamics.
We analyze in the context of geometrothermodynamics a Legendre invariant metric structure in the equilibrium space of an ideal gas. We introduce the concept of thermodynamic geodesic as a succession of points, each corresponding to a state of equilibrium, so that the resulting curve represents a quasi-static process. A rigorous geometric structure is derived in which the thermodynamic geodesics at a given point split the equilibrium space into two disconnected regions separated by adiabatic geodesics. This resembles the causal structure of special relativity, which we use to introduce the concept of adiabatic cone for thermodynamic systems. This result might be interpreted as an alternative indication of the inter-relationship between relativistic physics and classical thermodynamics.
We employ a perturbative scheme to study the evolution of a spherically symmetric stellar body undergoing gravitational collapse in the presence of heat dissipation and anisotropic stresses. The Bowers and Liang static model is perturbed, and its subsequent dynamical collapse is studied in the linear perturbative regime. We find that anisotropic effects brought about by the differences in the radial and tangential pressures render the core more unstable than the cooler surface layers. An analysis of the temperature profiles in the interior of the collapsing body shows that the temperature is enhanced in the presence of pressure anisotropy.
The energy content of the Reissner–Nordstrom black hole surrounded by quintessence is investigated using approximate Lie symmetry methods. It is mainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\epsilon \)</span>), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic equations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due to the presence of trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed geodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of the energy in this black hole. Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of the rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of the black hole, the normalization factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha \)</span>, which is related to the state parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(r\)</span>. A comparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner–Nordstrom black hole (Hussain et al. in SIGMA 3:115, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">2007</a></span>), without quintessence is given. It is observed that the presence of the quintessence field reduces the energy in this black hole spacetime. Further it is found that there exists a point outside the event horizon of this black hole where the effect of quintessence balances the energy content in this black hole without quintessence, and where the total energy of the underlying spacetime becomes zero.
We investigate the thermodynamics of general fluids that have the constriction that their pressure is constant. We first consider the more general thermodynamic properties of this class of fluids finding the important result that for them adiabatic and isothermal processes should coincide. We therefore study their behaviors in curved space-times where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">local thermal equilibrium</em> can be appealed. Thus, we show that this <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dark fluid</em> degenerates with the dark sector of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model only in the case of adiabatic evolution. We demonstrate that, adding dissipative processes, a phantom behavior can occur and finally we further highlight that an arbitrary decomposition of the dark sector, into <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> dark matter and dark energy terms, may give rise to phantom dark energy, whereas the whole dark sector remains non-phantom.
Using a WKB approximation of the Dirac equation in a curved spacetime, we obtain the expression for the phase shift between two neutrino mass eigenstates in a generic gravitational field. We apply this expression to two specific space-time geometries, namely the Kerr–Newman metric describing a rotating and charged black hole, and the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric.
In a recent study Akarsu and Dereli (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 45:1211, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12">2013</a></span>) discussed the dynamical reduction of a higher dimensional cosmological model which is augmented by a kinematical constraint characterized by a single real parameter, correlating and controlling the expansion of both the external (physical) and internal spaces. In that paper explicit solutions were found only for the case of three dimensional internal space (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n=3\)</span>). Here we derive a general solution of the system using Lie group symmetry properties, in parametric form for arbitrary number <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(n=1,2,3,\ldots \)</span> of internal dimensions. We also investigate the dynamical reduction of the model as a function of cosmic time <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(t\)</span> for various values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(n\)</span> and generate parametric plots to discuss cosmologically relevant results.
It has now become customary in the field of numerical relativity to couple high order finite difference schemes to mesh refinement algorithms. To this end, different modifications to the standard Berger–Oliger adaptive mesh refinement algorithm have been proposed. In this work we present a fourth order stable mesh refinement scheme with sub-cycling in time for numerical relativity. We do not use buffer zones to deal with refinement boundaries but explicitly specify boundary data for refined grids. We argue that the incompatibility of the standard mesh refinement algorithm with higher order Runge Kutta methods is a manifestation of order reduction phenomena, caused by inconsistent application of boundary data in the refined grids. Our scheme also addresses the problem of spurious reflections that are generated when propagating waves cross mesh refinement boundaries. We introduce a transition zone on refined levels within which the phase velocity of propagating modes is allowed to decelerate in order to smoothly match the phase velocity of coarser grids. We apply the method to test problems involving propagating waves and show a significant reduction in spurious reflections.
We review a simple but instructive application of the formalism of covariant bitensors, to use a deviation vector field along a fiducial geodesic to describe a neighboring worldline, in an exact and manifestly covariant manner, via the exponential map. Requiring the neighboring worldline to be a geodesic leads to the usual linear geodesic deviation equation for the deviation vector, plus corrections at higher order in the deviation and relative velocity. We show how these corrections can be efficiently computed to arbitrary orders via covariant bitensor expansions, deriving a form of the geodesic deviation equation valid to all orders, and producing its explicit expanded form through fourth order. We also discuss the generalized Jacobi equation, action principles for the higher-order geodesic deviation equations, results useful for describing accelerated neighboring worldlines, and the formal general solution to the geodesic deviation equation through second order.
We find the canonical formulation of the Poincaré BFCG theory in terms of the spatial 2-connection and its canonically conjugate momenta. We show that the Poincaré BFCG action is dynamically equivalent to the BF action for the Poincaré group and we find the canonical transformation relating the two. We study the canonical quantization of the Poincaré BFCG theory by passing to the Poincaré-connection basis. The quantization in the 2-connection basis can be then achieved by performing a Fourier transform. We also briefly discuss how to approach the problem of constructing a basis of spin-foam states, which are the categorical generalization of the spin-network states from loop quantum gravity.
In this paper we investigate the tunneling of fermions from a general static Riemann black hole by following Kerner and Mann (Class Quantum Gravit 25:095014, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12">2008a</a></span>; Phys Lett B 665:277–283, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">2008b</a></span>) methods. By applying the WKB approximation and the Hamilton–Jacobi ansatz to the Dirac equation, we obtain the standard Hawking temperature. Furthermore, Kerner and Mann (Class Quantum Gravit 25:095014, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12">2008a</a></span>; Phys Lett B 665:277–283, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">2008b</a></span>) only calculated the tunneling spectrum of the Dirac particles with spin-up, and we extend the methods to investigate the tunneling of Dirac particles with arbitrary spin directions and also obtain the expected Hawking temperature. Our result provides further evidence for the universality of black hole radiation.
We explore the connections between various coordinate systems associated with observers moving inwardly along radial geodesics in the Schwarzschild geometry. Painlevé–Gullstrand (PG) time is adapted to freely falling observers dropped from rest from infinity; Lake–Martel–Poisson (LMP) time coordinates are adapted to observers who start at infinity with non-zero initial inward velocity; Gautreau–Hoffmann time coordinates are adapted to observers dropped from rest from a finite distance from the black hole horizon. We construct from these an LMP family and a proper-time family of time coordinates, the intersection of which is PG time. We demonstrate that these coordinate families are distinct, but related, one-parameter generalizations of PG time, and show linkage to Lemaître coordinates as well.
We study a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical particle on an interval of finite length with a Hamiltonian that has a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(p^3\)</span> correction term, modelling potential low energy quantum gravity effects. We describe explicitly the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(U(3)\)</span> family of the self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian and discuss several subfamilies of interest. As the main result, we find a family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians, indexed by four continuous parameters and one binary parameter, whose spectrum and eigenfunctions are perturbatively close to those of the uncorrected particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, even though the Dirichlet condition as such is not in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(U(3)\)</span> family. Our boundary conditions do not single out distinguished discrete values for the length of the interval in terms of the underlying quantum gravity scale.
An exact solution of the Einstein–Maxwell field equations for a conformastationary metric with magnetized disk-haloes sources is worked out in full. The characterization of the nature of the energy momentum tensor of the source is discussed. All the expressions are presented in terms of a solution of the Laplace’s equation. A “generalization” of the Kuzmin solution of the Laplace’s equations is used as a particular example. The solution obtained is asymptotically flat in general and turns out to be free of singularities. All the relevant quantities show a reasonable physical behaviour.
This is the English translation by Jörg Frauendiener of a paper by Ludwig Flamm, first published in 1916, in which the author aims to render the conclusions of Einstein’s paper on the perihelion shift of Mercury and Schwarzschild’s (1916) papers clearer, more transparent and, in particular those relating to photon orbits, more accurate. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Gary W. Gibbons, and by a brief biography of L. Flamm, written by Hubert Goenner and Malcolm A.H. MacCallum.

Spherically symmetric, static on-brane geometries in the Kanno–Soda (KS) effective scalar–tensor theory of on-brane gravity are discussed. In order to avoid brane collisions and/or an infinite inter-brane distance, at finite values of the brane coordinates, it is necessary that the radion scalar be everywhere finite and non-zero. This requirement constrains the viability of the standard, well-known solutions in general relativity (GR), in the context of the KS effective theory. The radion for the Schwarzschild solution does not satisfy the above requirement. For the Reissner–Nordstrom (RN) naked singularity and the extremal RN solution, one can obtain everywhere finite, non-zero radion profiles, though the required on-brane matter violates the Weak Energy Condition. In contrast, for the RN black hole, the radion profile yields a divergent inter-brane distance at the horizon, which makes the solution unphysical. Thus, both the Schwarzschild and the RN solutions can be meaningful in the KS effective theory, only in the trivial GR limit, i.e. with a constant, non-zero radion.
A study of Universal thermodynamics is done in Lanczos–Lovelock gravity. The Universe is chosen as FRW model bounded by apparent or event horizon. The unified first law is examined, assuming extended Hawking temperature on the horizon. As a result there is a modification of Bekenstein entropy on the horizons. Further the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics and thermodynamical equilibrium are also investigated for perfect fluid (with constant equation of state), modified Chaplygin gas model and holographic dark energy model.
We show that the Bel–Robinson (BR) tensor is—generically, as well as in its original GR setting—an autonomously conserved part of the, manifestly conserved, double gradient of a system’s stress-tensor. This suggests its natural extension from GR to matter models, first to (known) massless scalars and vectors, then to massive ones, including tensors. These massive versions are to be expected, given that they arise upon KK reduction of massless <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D+1\)</span> ones. We exhibit the resulting spin <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\((0, 1, 2)\)</span> “massive” BR.
We suggest that using the first law of thermodynamics is a convenient method to obtain a correct form of the expansion law of the universe (Padmanabhan, <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4916"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1206.4916</span></a></span>v1 [hep-th]). We will, then, use this idea to obtain the expansion law for a Kodama observer. By using the expansion law for a Kodama observer, we can obtain the dynamic equation of the FRW universe for deformed Horava–Lifshitz gravity. The use of the first law of thermodynamics also leads to a new approach for obtaining the Friedmann equations for f(R) and scalar tensor gravities.
We analyze the main geometric conditions imposed by the hypothesis of the Jebsen–Birkhoff theorem. We show that the result (existence of an additional Killing vector) does not necessarily require a three-dimensional isometry group on two-dimensional orbits but only the existence of a conformal Killing–Yano tensor. In this approach the (additional) isometry appears as the known invariant Killing vector that the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal{D}}\)</span>-metrics admit.
Interaction of a charged particle in a static magnetic background, i.e., a Landau system with circularly polarised gravitational wave (GW) is studied quantum mechanically in the long wavelength and low velocity limit. We quantize the classical Hamiltonian following (Speliotopoulos in Phys Rev D 51:1701, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1995</a></span>). The rotating polarization vectors of the circularly polarized GW are employed to form a unique directional triad which served as the coordinate axes. The Schrodinger equations for the system are cast in the form of a set of coupled linear differential equations. This system is solved by iterative technique. We compute the time-evolution of the position and momentum expectation values of the particle. The results show that the resonance behaviour obtained earlier (Macedo and Nelson in Astrophys J 362:584, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1990</a></span>; Papadopoulos in Astron Astrophys 396:1045, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2002</a></span>) by classical treatements of the system has a quantum analogue not only for the linearly polarized GW (Gangopadhyay and Saha in Mod Phys Lett A 27:1250192, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">2012</a></span>), but for circularly polarized GW as well.
Certain off-diagonal vacuum and nonvacuum configurations in Einstein gravity can mimic physical effects of modified gravitational theories of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\( f(R,T,R_{\mu \nu }T^{\mu \nu })\)</span> type. We prove this statement by constructing exact and approximate solutions which encode certain models of covariant Hořava type gravity with dynamical Lorentz symmetry breaking. Off-diagonal generalizations of de Sitter and nonholonomic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM universes are constructed which are generated through nonlinear gravitational polarization of fundamental physical constants and which model interactions with non-constant exotic fluids and effective matter. The problem of possible matter instability for such off-diagonal deformations in (modified) gravity theories is discussed.
This paper investigates the effects of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f{(}R{)}=R+\alpha R^2\)</span> model on the dissipative anisotropic non-static rotating axial stellar system using structure scalars. By orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor, we obtain structure scalars and explore their roles for dissipative relativistic fluid configuration. We investigate the contribution of structure scalars in the evolution of various kinematical variables (e.g. expansion, shear and vorticity). Finally, we discuss thermodynamical aspects and the effect of dissipation on inertial mass density through transport equation. It is interesting to mention here that all our results reduce to the previous known results in the limiting case.
The mass of a sphere of simmetry in the Lemaître universe is discussed using the Hawking–Hayward quasi-local energy and clarifying existing ambiguities. A covariantly conserved current introduced by Cahill and McVittie is shown to be a multiple of the Kodama energy current.
We analyze what we believe to be all known homogeneous rotating <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\varLambda \)</span>-dust cosmologies, to see if they contain closed timelike loops (CTLs). We investigate only these exact GR solutions because they appear to most closely resemble our own universe (apart from rotation and expansion). These solutions are all somewhat similar to the Gödel solution, which is known to contain CTLs. Of these solutions, it turns out that exactly those with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\varLambda &lt;0\)</span> possess CTLs. The paper also analyzes the solutions to see if they satisfy the four “Energy Conditions” (Weak, Null, Strong, Dominant), and shows that all four are satisfied—but only by the families <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">containing</em> CTLs! It is amusing to note that our current universe violates the Strong Energy Condition.
We construct the gravitational energy-momentum of the Bondi–Sachs space-time, in the famework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). The Bondi–Sachs line element describes gravitational radiation in the asymptotic region of the space-time, and is determined by the mass aspect and by two functions, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>, that yield the news functions, which are interpreted as the radiating degrees of freedom of the gravitational field. The standard expression for the Bondi–Sachs energy-momentum is constructed in terms of the mass aspect only. The expression that we obtain in the context of the TEGR is given by the standard expression, which represents the gravitational energy of the source, plus a new term that is determined by the two functions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>. We interpret this new term as the energy of gravitational radiation.
We study Galileon scalar field model by considering the lowest order Galileon term in the Lagrangian, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((\partial _{\mu } \phi )^2 \Box \phi \)</span> by invoking a field potential. We use Statefinder hierarchy to distinguish the light mass Galileon models with different potentials amongst themselves and from the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM behaviour. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Om</em> diagnostic is applied to cosmological dynamics and observational constraints on the model parameters are studied using SN + Hubble + BAO data.
The idea of defining a gravitational singularity as an obstruction to the dynamical evolution of a test field (described by a PDE) rather than the dynamical evolution of a particle (described by a geodesics) is explored. The concept of field regularity is introduced which serves to describe the well-posedness of the local initial value problem for a given field. In particular this is applied to (classical) scalar fields in the class of curve integrable spacetimes to show that the classical singularities do not interrupt the well-posedness of the wave equation.
Two different approaches to gravitational perturbation theory appear to give two different answers for the properties of gravitational wave memory. We show that this contradiction is only apparent and the two approaches actually agree.
We investigate, from a quantum viewpoint, the nature of the linearized quadratic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(R)=(R+aR^2)\)</span>-gravity. To derive the explicit expression of the underlying propagator of the theory, the field is coupled to an external energy–momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(T^{\mu \nu }\)</span>, and an auxiliary field is introduced to deal with gauge constraints as done in gauge theories. In particular for a conserved <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(T^{\mu \nu }\)</span>, we establish the gauge invariance of the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\langle 0_+|0_-\rangle \)</span>, and prove the necessary positivity condition <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(|\langle 0_+|0_-\rangle |^2 &lt; 1\)</span>, for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, required by the quantum theory aspect of the treatment. An exact expression is then derived of the number of particles emitted, at a given energy, by a circularly oscillating Nambu string from which we may compare the relative number of the spin 0 massive particles emitted to the graviton number which turns up to give a clear cut departure from the general relativity prediction.
In this work we present a refined method for the localization of spin-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> fermions on the 5D braneworld paradigm. We begin by proposing a more natural ansatz for the Yukawa coupling in the 5D bulk fermionic action, that guarantees the localization of the ground states for the 4D fermions with right- or left-chirality. In earlier works the existing freedom on the form of the Yukawa coupling was used in a rather speculative way depending on the type of model, the ansatz proposed in this work is suitable for thin and thick braneworld models and can be applied to branes made of a scalar field or not and in this sense it is the more natural choice. Furthermore, we show that the fermion ground states localization allow us to show the absence of tachyonic modes in the left- and right-chiral Kaluza–Klein mass spectrum. More precisely, we show that localization of gravity in the 5D braneworld implies the localization of the spin-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> fermions.
We study boson stars in a theory of complex scalar field coupled to Einstein gravity with the potential: <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V(|\varPhi |) := m^{2} |\varPhi |^2 +2 \lambda |\varPhi |\)</span> (where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(m^2\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\lambda \)</span> are positive constant parameters). This could be considered either as a theory of massive complex scalar field coupled to gravity in a conical potential or as a theory in the presence of a potential which is an overlap of a parabolic and a conical potential. We study our theory with positive as well as negative values of the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\varLambda \)</span>. Boson stars are found to come in two types, having either ball-like or shell-like charge density. We have studied the properties of these solutions and have also determined their domains of existence for some specific values of the parameters of the theory. Similar solutions have also been obtained by Hartmann, Kleihaus, Kunz, and Schaffer, in a V-shaped scalar potential.
We derive asymptote solution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe governed by the quadratic form of the field equation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) gravity. We explain how the higher order of the torsion can provide an origin for late accelerated phase of the universe in the FRW. The solution makes the scalar torsion <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> to be a function of the cosmic time <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>. We show that for the equation of state <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p=\omega \rho \)</span> with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\omega \ne -1\)</span> the scale factor represent late phase of universe. We perform the cosmological studies and show how the quadratic form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) effect on the behavior of these studies.

Using the correspondence between a minimally coupled scalar field and an effective stiff perfect fluid with or without a cosmological constant, we present a simple method for generating time dependent Einstein-scalar solutions with a conformally coupled scalar field that has vanishing or non-vanishing potential. This is done by using Bekenstein’s transformation on Einstein-scalar solutions with minimally coupled massless scalar fields, and its later generalization by Abreu et al. to massive fields. In particular we obtain two new spherically symmetric time dependent solutions to the coupled system of Einstein’s and the conformal scalar field equations, with one of the solutions having a Higgs’ type potential for the scalar field, and we study their properties.
As an alternative to the paradigm of slow roll inflation, we propose an extended scenario of the matter bounce cosmology in which the Universe has experienced a quasi-matter contracting phase with a variable background equation of state parameter. This extended matter bounce scenario can be realized by considering a single scalar field evolving along an approximately exponential potential. Our result reveals that the rolling of the scalar field in general leads to a running behavior on the spectral index of primordial cosmological perturbations and a negative running can be realized in this model. We constrain the corresponding parameter space by using the newly released Planck data. To apply this scenario, we revisit bouncing cosmologies within the context of modified gravity theories, in particular, the holonomy corrected loop quantum cosmology and teleparallel <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) gravity. A gravitational process of reheating is presented in such a matter bounce scenario to demonstrate the condition of satisfying current observations. We also comment on several unresolved issues that often appear in matter bounce models.
A polynomial action in the gauge fields is proposed for two and three dimensions, reproducing quadratic gravity. Such action is further amenable for quantization and based upon the topological BF theory.
This work is devoted to drive an energy-momentum complex (due to matter and fields including gravity) in the realm of modified teleparallel gravity. For this purpose, the Lagrangian of teleparallel theory is extended to a more general form by replacing the torsion scalar with an arbitrary function of it. Furthermore, considering cosmological perturbations, we explicitly calculate energy distribution associated with the Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker spacetime. Finally, we discuss also the coupling case between matter and gravity in the context of teleparallel modified theory.
The stability of interacting holographic dark energy model is discussed. It is found that for some class of the rate of interaction between dark matter and dark energy, the system has a natural solution where the universe had been decelerating in the beginning but finally settles down to an accelerated phase of expansion.
Motivated by the wide applications of thermal stability and phase transition, we investigate thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ black holes. We apply the standard method to calculate the heat capacity and the Hessian matrix and find that thermal stability of charged BTZ solutions depends on the choice of ensemble. To overcome this problem, we take into account cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable. By this modification, we show that the ensemble dependency is eliminated and thermal stability conditions are the same in both ensembles. Then, we generalize our solutions to the case of nonlinear electrodynamics. We show how nonlinear matter field modifies the geometrical behavior of the metric function. We also study phase transition and thermal stability of these black holes in context of both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We show that by considering the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable and modifying the Hessian matrix, the ensemble dependency of thermal stability will be eliminated.
We consider the Einstein-dilaton gravity in the presence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics, and find a new class of four-dimensional spinning magnetic dilaton string solutions which produces a longitudinal nonlinear electromagnetic field. We find that these solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizon, but have a conic geometry. The net electric charge of the spinning string is proportional to the rotating parameter and the electric field only exists when the rotation parameter does not vanish. We investigate the effects of the nonlinearity as well as the dilaton field on the physical properties of the spacetime. Because of the presence of the dilaton field, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions are neither flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. We find the deficit angle of the spacetime and investigate the effects of dilaton and nonlinear electrodynamics on the value of the deficit angle. We use the counterterm method to calculate the conserved quantities of the solutions. Furthermore, we extend our study to the higher dimensions and obtain the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((n+1)\)</span>-dimensional magnetic rotating dilaton strings with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(k\le [n/2]\)</span> rotation parameters and calculate electric charge and conserved quantities of the solutions.
In this paper we analyze spherically symmetric static vacuum solutions with various topologies in mimetic gravity. When the Einstein’s tensor is different from zero, a new class of solutions different from the Schwarzschild one emerges from the theory. We analyze the feature of the new solutions and we study the planar motion for the spherical case.
Classically, black holes admit maximal interior volumes that grow asymptotically linearly in time. We show that such volumes remain large when Hawking evaporation is taken into account. Even if a charged black hole approaches the extremal limit during this evolution, its volume continues to grow; although an exactly extremal black hole does not have a “large interior”. We clarify this point and discuss the implications of our results to the information loss and firewall paradoxes.
In this paper, we propose a model in which an additional pressure due to the effects of the entropic force is added to the ideal fluid. Furthermore, we obtain the dynamic equation in the FRW universe which contains the quantum gravitational effects based on the description of entropic force and emergence of space. Our model can well explain the age of the universe and the effect of the current accelerating expansion. We give the relation between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor, and compare this relation with that of lambda cold dark matter model (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varLambda \textit{CDM}\)</span> model).
Recently, we have generalized the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula for black holes embedded in expanding Friedmann universes. In this letter, we begin the study of this new formula to obtain the first law of thermodynamics for dynamical apparent horizons. In this regard we obtain a generalized expression for the internal energy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> together with a distinction between the dynamical temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(T_D\)</span> of apparent horizons and the related one due to thermodynamics formulas. Remarkable, when the expression for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em> is applied to the apparent horizon of the universe, we found that this internal energy is a constant of motion. Our calculations thus show that the total energy of our spatially flat universe including the gravitational contribution, when calculated at the apparent horizon, is an universal constant that can be set to zero from simple dimensional considerations. This strongly support the holographic principle.
We present a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2+1\)</span> decomposition of the vacuum initial conditions in general relativity. For a constant mean curvature one of the momentum constraints decouples in quasi isotropic coordinates and it can be solved by quadrature. The remaining momentum constraints are written in the form of the tangential Cauchy–Riemann equation. Under additional assumptions its solutions can be written in terms of integrals of known functions. We show how to obtain initial data with a marginally outer trapped surface. A generalization of the Kerr data is presented.
The paper aims to provide an explanation for the tiny value of the cosmological constant and the low vacuum energy density to represent the dark energy. To accomplish this, we will search for a fundamental principle of symmetry in space-time by means of the elimination of the classical idea of rest, by including an invariant minimum limit of speed in the subatomic world. Such a minimum speed, unattainable by particles, represents a preferred reference frame associated with a background field that breaks down the Lorentz symmetry. The metric of the flat space-time shall include the presence of a uniform vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological length scales. Thus, the equation of state for the cosmological constant [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>(pressure)<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(=-\epsilon \)</span> (energy density)] naturally emerges from such a space-time with an energy barrier of a minimum speed. The tiny values of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density will be successfully obtained, being in agreement with the observational results of Perlmutter, Schmidt and Riess.
To extend previous results on the late time behavior of massive fields, for the Dirac field propagating in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Minkowski spacetime we calculate analytically its asymptotic tails. We find that the massive Dirac field has an oscillatory inverse power law tail. The frequency of the oscillations depends on the mass of the field and the power law decay rate depends on the dimension of the spacetime and the mode number of the angular eigenvalues. We also compare with previous results in curved spacetimes.
In this paper, quartic quasi-topological black holes in the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic Born–Infeld field is presented. By using the metric parameters, the charged black hole solutions of quasi-topological Born–Infeld gravity is considered. The thermodynamics of these black holes are investigated and I show that the thermodynamics and conserved quantities verify the first law of thermodynamics. I also introduce the thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS rotating black branes with flat horizon of these class of solutions and I calculate the finite action by use of the counterterm method inspired by AdS/CFT correspondence.
The Einstein field equations for any spherically symmetric metric and a geodesic perfect fluid source are cast in a canonical simple form, both for Lorentzian metrics and for instantons. Both kinds of metrics are explicitly written for the Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi family and for a general <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varLambda \)</span>-Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe. In the latter case (including of course the instanton version) we study whether the probability of quantum creation of our Universe vanishes or not. It is found, in accordance with previous results, that only the closed model can have a nonzero probability for quantum creation. To obtain this result, we resort to general assumptions, which are satisfied in the particular creation case considered by Vilenkin. On the other hand, Fomin and Tryon suggested that the energy of a quantically creatable universe should vanish. This is in accordance with the above result in which only the closed <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varLambda \)</span>FLRW model is quantically creatable while the open and flat models are not. That is so since it can be seen that this closed model has vanishing energy while the open model and the limiting flat case (suitably perturbed) have both infinite energy.
We study Bertrand space-times (BSTs), which have been proposed as viable models of space-times seeded by galactic dark matter, in modified theories of gravity. We first critically examine the issue of galactic rotation curves in general relativity, and establish the usefulness of BSTs to fit experimental data in this context. We then study BSTs in metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity and in Brans–Dicke theories. For the former, the nature of the Newtonian potential is established, and we also compute the effective equation of state and show that it can provide good fits to some recent experimental results. For the latter, we calculate the Brans–Dicke scalar analytically in some limits and numerically in general, and find interesting constraints on the parameters of the theory. Our results provide evidence for the physical nature of BSTs in modified theories of gravity.
In classical general relativity, singularity theorems are concerned with the existence of an incomplete inextendible nonspacelike geodesic. We prove the incompleteness of a geodesic surface under assumptions on the Gaussian curvature of the geodesic surface and the elasticity of the string.
Based on a more careful canonical analysis, we motivate a reduced quantization—in the sense of superspace quantization—of slightly inhomogeneous cosmology in place of the Dirac quantization in the existing literature, and provide it in the vacuum case. This is attained through consideration of configuration space geometries at various levels of reduction. Some of these have the good fortunate of being flat. Geometrically natural coordinates for these are interpreted in terms of the original redundant formulation’s well-known mode expansion coefficients.
We constrain scattering length parameters in a Bose–Einstein condensate dark matter model by using galaxy clusters radii, with the implementation of a method previously applied to galaxies. At the present work, we use a sample of 114 clusters radii in order to obtain the scattering lengths associated with a dark matter particle mass in the range <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(10^{-6}\)</span>–<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(10^{-4}\)</span> eV. We obtain scattering lengths that are five orders of magnitude larger than the ones found in the galactic case, even when taking into account the cosmological expansion in the cluster scale by means of the introduction of a small cosmological constant. We also construct and compare curves for the orbital velocity of a test particle in the vicinity of a dark matter cluster in both the expanding and the non-expanding cases.
In this paper, we will study non-commutative corrections in the metric tensor for the Gödel-type universe, a model that has as its main characteristic the possibility of violation of causality, allowing therefore time travel. We also find that the critical radius in such a model, which eventually will determine the time travel possibility, is modified due to the non commutativity of spatial coordinates.
This paper is devoted to study self-gravitating spherically symmetric fluid models in Brans–Dicke gravity. We formulate a set of equations which govern the dynamics of evolving gravitating fluids through Weyl tensor, shear tensor, expansion scalar, anisotropy, energy inhomogeneity, dissipation as well as scalar field. We also discuss some particular cases according to different dynamical conditions. It is concluded that fluid models for regular distribution of scalar field are consistent with general relativity and models due to irregular distribution of scalar field deviate from theory of general relativity.
We model spacetime foam by a gas of virtual wormholes. For a free scalar field we derive the effective Lagrangian which accounts for the interaction with spacetime foam and contains two additional non-local terms. One term describes the scattering of scalar particles on virtual wormholes and explicitly reproduces the Pauli–Villars regularization procedure. The second term describes the back reaction of particles on the number density of wormholes and introduces a self-interaction between particles.
In this work we present an alternative derivation of the general relativistic acoustic analogue geometry by perturbing the mass accretion rate or flux of an ideal fluid flowing radially in a general static and spherically symmetric spacetime. To the best of our knowledge, this has so far been done in non-relativistic scenario. The resulting causal structure of the two dimensional acoustic geometry is qualitatively similar to that one derives via the perturbation of the velocity potential. Using this, we then briefly discuss the stability issues by studying the wave configurations generated by the perturbation of the mass accretion rate, and formally demonstrate the stability of the accretion process. This is in qualitative agreement with earlier results on stability, established via study of wave configurations generated by the perturbation of velocity potential, by using the acoustic geometry associated with it. We further discuss explicit examples of the Schwarzschild and Rindler spacetimes.
Using the reconstruction technique with an auxiliary field, we investigate which <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravities can produce the matter bounce cosmological solutions. Owing to the specific functional form of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, the reconstruction technique leads, after some simplifications, to the same Hubble parameter as in the matter bounce scenario. Focusing the study to the large and small cosmic time <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> limits, we were able to find which <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small cosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(F(R)\sim R+\alpha R^2\)</span>, which is an inflation generating gravity, and at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity generating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(F(R)\sim \frac{1}{R}\)</span>, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration. Thus we have the physically appealing picture in which a Jordan frame <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity that imitates the matter bounce solution at large and small curvatures, can generate Starobinsky inflation and late-time acceleration. Moreover, the scale factor corresponding to the reconstruction technique coincides almost completely to the matter bounce scenario scale factor, when considered in the aforementioned limiting curvature cases. This is scrutinized in detail, in order to examine the validity of the reconstruction method in these limiting cases, and according to our analysis, exact agreement is achieved.
Motivated by conformal relation between dilaton gravity and Brans–Dicke theory, in this paper, we are taking into account extended phase space thermodynamics to investigate phase transition of charged black holes. We regard spherically symmetric charged black hole solutions in the presence of a scalar field in both Einstein and Jordan frames and calculate related conserved and thermodynamic quantities. Then, we study the analogy of the black hole solution with the Van der Waals liquid–gas system in the extended phase space by considering the cosmological constant proportional to thermodynamical pressure. We obtain critical values of thermodynamic coordinates and plot <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(P-V\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(G-T\)</span> diagrams to study the phase transition points and compare the results of dilaton gravity and Brans–Dicke theory.
In this paper, we study Hawking radiation of massless and massive charged particles via tunneling process across the event horizon from the Schwarzschild and Reissner–Nordström black holes pierced by an infinitely long spinning cosmic string and a global monopole. Applying the WKB approximation and using a generalized Painlevé line element for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, also by taking into account that the ADM mass and charge of the black hole decreases due to the presence of topological defects, it is shown that the Hawking temperature remains unchanged for these black holes. Furthermore, the tunneling rate is related to the change of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in both cases. The results extend the work of Parikh and Wilczek and are consistent with an underlying unitary theory.
In this manuscript, a conformally invariant theory of gravitation in the context of metric measure space is studied. The proposed action is invariant under both diffeomorphism and conformal transformations. Using the variational method, a generalization of the Einstein equation is obtained, wherein the conventional tensors are replaced by their conformally invariant counterparts, living in metric measure space. The invariance of the geometrical part of the action under a diffeomorphism leads to a generalized contracted second Bianchi identity. In metric measure space, the covariant derivative is the same as it is in the Riemannian space. Hence, in contrast to the Weyl space, the metricity and integrability are maintained. However, it is worth noting that in metric measure space the divergence of a tensor is not simply the contraction of the covariant derivative operator with the tensor that it acts on. Despite the fact that metric measure space and integrable Weyl space, are constructed based on different assumptions, it is shown that some relations in these spaces, such as the contracted second Bianchi identity, are completely similar.
The present work deals with three alternative generalized Bekenstein–Hawking formulation of thermodynamical parameters namely entropy and temperature for the universal thermodynamical system bounded by a horizon in the frame work of inhomogeneous perfect fluid Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model of the Universe. For the first choice, the first law of thermodynamics holds only for the trivial de Sitter case of the LTB model while we still need to examine the integrability of the Gibbs one-form to test the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics. However, for the other two choices, the first law of thermodynamics holds for general LTB models, provided some specific form of the parameters are integrable and self-consistent.
We extend de la Fuente and Romero’s (Gen Relativ Gravit 47:33, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2015</a></span>) defining equation for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">uniform acceleration in a general curved spacetime</em> from linear acceleration to the full Lorentz covariant uniform acceleration. In a flat spacetime background, we have explicit solutions. We use generalized Fermi-Walker transport to parallel transport the Frenet basis along the trajectory. In flat spacetime, we obtain velocity and acceleration transformations from a uniformly accelerated system to an inertial system. We obtain the time dilation between accelerated clocks. We apply our acceleration transformations to the motion of a charged particle in a constant electromagnetic field and recover the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac</em> equation.
The process of black hole evaporation resulting from the Hawking effect has generated an intense controversy regarding its potential conflict with quantum mechanics’ unitary evolution. A recent set of works by a collaboration involving one of us, have revised the controversy with the aims of, on one hand, clarifying some conceptual issues surrounding it, and, at the same time, arguing that collapse theories have the potential to offer a satisfactory resolution of the so-called paradox. Here we show an explicit calculation supporting this claim using a simplified model of black hole creation and evaporation, known as the CGHS model, together with a dynamical reduction theory, known as CSL, and some speculative, but seemingly natural ideas about the role of quantum gravity in connection with the would-be singularity. This work represents a specific realization of general ideas first discussed in Okon and Sudarsky (Found Phys 44:114–143, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2014</a></span>) and a complete and detailed analysis of a model first considered in Modak et al. (Phys Rev D 91(12):124009, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2015</a></span>).
In the present article we shall consider the torsional completion of a gravitational background that is filled with electrodynamically interacting material fields, taken to be of fermionic type, eventually deriving properties like the impossibility of singularities and the possibility of confinement, both necessary for a correct quantum description.
In the present work the power spectrum of a particular class of tachyon fields is compared with the one corresponding to a cosmological constant model. This is done for different barotropic indexes <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\gamma _0\)</span> and the background space time is assumed to be of the spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker type. The differential equation describing the perturbations is solved numerically and the power spectrum at the scale factor value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(a=1\)</span> is plotted for each case. The result is that the power spectrum of the standard tachyon field differs in many magnitude orders from the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM. However, the one with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\gamma _0=1.91\)</span>, which corresponds to a complementary tachyon field, coincides fairly well with the concordance model. Therefore, we conclude that the perturbed solutions constitute an effective method to distinguish between the different <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\gamma _0\)</span> values for the tachionization <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model and the fiducial model . The Statefinder parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\{r, s\}\)</span>, measuring the deviations of the analysed model from the concordance model, are also explicitly calculated. Our result suggest that, depending on the value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\gamma _0\)</span>, these models can explain the observed expansion history or the perturbation power spectrum of the universe, but they may have problems in describing both features simultaneously.
The generalization of the four-dimensional Kerr–Newman black holes to include the nonlinear electrodynamics has been one of the famous problems in black hole physics. In this paper, we address the effects of the small rotation parameter on the exact black hole solutions of Einstein-dilaton gravity coupled to the exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We find a new stationary black hole solutions of this theory, in the limit of small angular momentum, and in the presence of Liouville-type potential for the dilaton field and an arbitrary value of the dilaton coupling constant. We compute the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of these rotating dilaton black holes. Interestingly enough, we find that the nonlinearity of the electrodynamics do not affect the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of the spacetime, while in contrast, the dilaton field can modify the angular momentum as well as the gyromagnetic ratio of the rotating black holes. We find the gyromagnetic ratio as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(g=6/(3-\alpha ^2)\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span> is the coupling constant of the dilaton and the electrodynamic fields. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\alpha =0\)</span>, we arrive at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(g=2\)</span>, which is the gyromagnetic ratio of the Kerr–Newman black holes in four dimensions.
We generalize the Noether current method proposed by Majhi and Padmanabhan recently to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity and conformal gravity and analyze the near horizon symmetry of black holes in these models. It is shown that the entropy obtained with Cardy’s formula agrees with Wald entropy.
We introduce conformal traceless decomposition in Lagrange Multiplier modified RFDiff invariant Hořava–Lifshitz gravity. We perform Hamiltonian analysis of given action and determine the action for the physical degrees of freedom.
We consider the entropy associated with the large-scale structure of the Universe in the linear regime, where the Universe can be described by a perturbed Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime. In particular, we compare two different definitions proposed in the literature for the entropy using a spatial averaging prescription. For one definition, the entropy of the large-scale structure for a given comoving volume always grows with time, both for a CDM and a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model. In particular, while it diverges for a CDM model, it saturates to a constant value in the presence of a cosmological constant. The use of a light-cone averaging prescription in the context of the evaluation of the entropy is also discussed.
It is common to think of our universe according to the “block universe” concept, which says that spacetime consists of many “stacked” three-surfaces, labelled by some kind of proper time, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\tau \)</span>. Standard ideas do not distinguish past and future, but Ellis’ “evolving block universe” tries to make a fundamental distinction. One proposal for this proper time is the proper time measured along the timelike Ricci eigenlines, starting from the big bang. This work investigates the shape of the “Ricci time” surfaces relative to the the null surfaces. We use the Lemaître–Tolman metric as our inhomogeneous spacetime model, and we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for these <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\{\tau = \)</span> constant<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\}\)</span> surfaces, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(S(\tau )\)</span>, to be spacelike or timelike. Furthermore, we look at the effect of strong gravity domains by determining the location of timelike <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> regions relative to apparent horizons. We find that constant Ricci time surfaces are always spacelike near the big bang, while at late times (near the crunch or the extreme far future), they are only timelike under special circumstances. At intermediate times, timelike <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> regions are common unless the variation of the bang time is restricted. The regions where these surfaces become timelike are often adjacent to apparent horizons, but always outside them, and in particular timelike <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> regions do not occur inside the horizons of black-hole-like models.
We study how the changes of coordinates between the class of harmonic coordinates affect the analitycal solutions of Einstein’s equations and we apply it to an analytical approach for stationary and axisymmetric solutions of Einstein equation used by Cabezas et al. (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 39:707–736, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2007</a></span>) and Cuchí et al. (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 45:1433–1456, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2013</a></span>) to solve the problem of a self-gravitating rigidly rotating perfect fluid compact source.
Particle creation has been considered as a possible justification for the accelerated expansion of the universe, obeying the second law of thermodynamics, together with the possible existence of dark energy. This paper introduces the possibility that the destruction of baryonic and/or dark matter particles also verifies the second law of thermodynamics thanks to a particle exchange with dark energy. General equations for the variation of the number of particles in accelerated universes have been obtained. Finally, a new model of the universe has been developed which predicts dark energy properties as well as particle exchange processes between dark energy and baryonic and/or dark matter.

In the context of metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, the geodesic deviation equation (GDE) was first studied in Guarnizo et al. (Gen Relativ Gravit 43:2713–2728, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2011</a></span>), giving a general expression and studying a particular case, the FLRW universe. In the paper (De la Cruz-Dombris et al. Physical Review D 89:064029-2014) a similar analysis was made. However, there is a discrepancy in the expressions for the null vector field case due to an algebraic error in our original paper. Here, we make explicit the contribution of the different operators in the GDE, and we correct our previous results.
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most powerful sources in the universe. In the recent years, GRBs have been proposed as a complementary probe to type Ia supernovae. However, as is well known, there is a circularity problem in the use of GRBs to study cosmology. In this work, based on the Padé approximant, we propose a new cosmology-independent method to calibrate GRBs. We consider a sample consisting of 138 long Swift GRBs and obtain 79 calibrated long GRBs at high-redshift <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(z&gt;1.4\)</span> (named Mayflower sample) which can be used to constrain cosmological models without the circularity problem. Then, we consider the constraints on several cosmological models with these 79 calibrated GRBs and other observational data. We show that GRBs are competent to be a complementary probe to the other well-established cosmological observations.
We give a brief review of the non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) scalar field theory in which there is non-minimal coupling between the scalar field derivative term and the Einstein tensor. We assume that the expansion is of power-law type or super-acceleration type for small redshift. The Lagrangian includes the NMDC term, a free kinetic term, a cosmological constant term and a barotropic matter term. For a value of the coupling constant that is compatible with inflation, we use the combined WMAP9 (WMAP9 + eCMB + BAO + <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(H_0\)</span>) dataset, the PLANCK + WP dataset, and the PLANCK <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TT</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TE</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">EE</em> + lowP + Lensing + ext datasets to find the value of the cosmological constant in the model. Modeling the expansion with power-law gives a negative cosmological constants while the phantom power-law (super-acceleration) expansion gives positive cosmological constant with large error bar. The value obtained is of the same order as in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model, since at late times the NMDC effect is tiny due to small curvature.
The aim here is to provide a set of equations for cosmology in terms of information and thermodynamical parameters. The method we implement in order to describe the universe is a development of Padmanabhan’s approach which is based on the fact that emergence of the cosmic space is provided by the evolution of the cosmic time. In this line we obtain the Friedmann equation or its equivalent the conservation law in terms of information by the implementation of Landauer’s principle or in other words the information loss/production rate. Hence, a self consistent description of the universe is provided in terms of thermodynamical parameters. This is due to the fact that in this work the role of information which is the most important actor of all times, has stepped in to cosmology. We provide a picture of the emergent cosmology merely based on the information theory. In addition, we introduce a novel entropy on the horizon, which can also generalize Bekenstein–Hawking entropy for the asymptotic holographic principle.
Anisotropic Bianchi type-I magnetized string cosmological models are obtained in decaying vacuum energy density proposed by Pradhan (Commun Theor Phys 55:931–941, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR30">2011</a></span>). In this study, we obtain some physical and geometrical properties of biharmonic particles of a new spacetime using Bianchi type-I (B-I) cosmological model. We use solution of the Einstein’s field equations for biharmonic particles. Some important features of the model have been discussed. Established the existence of string cosmological models for biharmonic particles, unlike the earlier authors, in this theory and studied some physical and geometrical properties.
In this paper we propose a scheme which allows one to find all possible exponential solutions of special class—non-constant volume solutions—in Lovelock gravity in arbitrary number of dimensions and with arbitrate combinations of Lovelock terms. We apply this scheme to (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(6+1\)</span>)- and (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(7+1\)</span>)-dimensional flat anisotropic cosmologies in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet and third-order Lovelock gravity to demonstrate how our scheme does work. In course of this demonstration we derive all possible solutions in (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(6+1\)</span>) and (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(7+1\)</span>) dimensions and compare solutions and their abundance between cases with different Lovelock terms present. As a special but more “physical” case we consider spaces which allow three-dimensional isotropic subspace for they could be viewed as examples of compactification schemes. Our results suggest that the same solution with three-dimensional isotropic subspace is more “probable” to occur in the model with most possible Lovelock terms taken into account, which could be used as kind of anthropic argument for consideration of Lovelock and other higher-order gravity models in multidimensional cosmologies.
Generalized second law of thermodynamics in the Bianchi Type I universe with the generalized holographic Ricci dark energy model is studied in this paper. The behavior of dark energy’s equation of state parameter indicates that it is matter-like in the early time of the universe but phantom-like in the future. By analysing the evolution of the deviations of state parameter and the total pressure of the universe, we find that for an anisotropic Bianchi Type I universe, it transits from a high anisotropy stage to a more homogeneous stage in the near past. Using the normal entropy given by Gibbs’ law of thermodynamics, it is proved that the generalized second law of thermodynamics does not always satisfied throughout the history of the universe when we assume the universe is enclosed by the generalized Ricci scalar radius <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R_{gr}\)</span>. It becomes invalid in the near past to the future, and the formation of the galaxies will be helpful in explaining such phenomenon, for that the galaxies’s formation is an entropy increase process. The negative change rate of the horizon entropy and internal entropy occur in different period indicates that the influences of galaxies formation is wiped from internal to the universe’s horizon.
We study topological dilaton black holes of Einstein gravity in the presence of exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. The event horizons of these black holes can be a two-dimensional positive, zero or negative constant curvature surface. We analyze thermodynamics of these solutions by calculating all conserved and thermodynamic quantities and showing that the first law holds on the black hole horizon. Then, we perform the stability analysis in both canonical and grand canonical ensemble and disclose the effects of the dilaton and nonlinear electrodynamics on the thermal stability of the solutions. Finally, we study the phase transition points of these black holes in the thermodynamic geometry approach.
We study the simple gauge invariant model <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({f^2}FF\)</span> as a way to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMF) in natural inflation (NI). We compute both magnetic and electric spectra generated by the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({f^2}FF\)</span> model in NI for different values of model parameters and find that both de Sitter and power law expansion lead to the same results at sufficiently large number of e-foldings. We also find that the necessary scale invariance property of the PMF cannot be obtained in NI in first order of slow roll limits under the constraint of inflationary potential, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(V\left( 0 \right) \simeq 0\)</span>. Furthermore, if this constraint is relaxed to achieve scale invariance, then the model suffers from the backreaction problem for the co-moving wave number, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(k \lesssim 8.0\times 10^{-7} \mathrm {Mpc^{-1}}\)</span> and Hubble parameter, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(H_i \gtrsim 1.25\times 10^{-3} \mathrm {M_\mathrm{{Pl}}}\)</span>. The former can be considered as a lower bound of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> and the later as an upper bound of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(H_i\)</span> for a model which is free from the backreaction problem. Further, we show that there is a narrow range of the height of the potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda \)</span> around <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\({\Lambda _{\min }} \approx 0.00874{M_{\mathrm{{Pl}}}}\)</span> and of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> around <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\({k_{\min }} \sim 0.0173\mathrm{{Mp}}{\mathrm{{c}}^{ - 1}}\)</span>, at which the energy of the electric field can fall below the energy of the magnetic field. The range of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> lies within some observable scales. However, the relatively short range of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> presents a challenge to the viability of this model.
Recently we have found an asymptotically AdS solution for Einstein’s equations, those of thermodynamics match those of a special case of polytropic gas (Setare and Adami in Phys Rev D 91:084014, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2015</a></span>). Here we show that a polytropic black hole can be considered as a heat engine and then we calculate work done by this system and its efficiency.
Possible astrophysical consequences of the Hořava quantum gravity theory have been recently studied by several authors. They usually employ the Kehagias–Sfetsos (KS) spacetime which is a spherically symmetric vacuum solution of a specific version of Hořava’s gravity. The KS metric has several unusual geometrical properties that in the present article we examine by means of the often used technique of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">embedding diagrams</em>. We pay particular attention to the transition between naked singularity and black-hole states, which is possible along some particular sequences of the KS metrics.
We show that causality violation in a Kerr naked singularity spacetime is constrained by the existence of (radial) potential barriers. We extend to the class of vortical non-equatorial null geodesics confined to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\theta \)</span> <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(=\)</span> constant hyperboloids (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">boreal</em> orbits) previous results concerning timelike ones (Calvani et al. in Gen Rel Gravit 9:155, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1978</a></span>), showing that within this class of orbits, the causality principle is rigorously satisfied.
We study the motion of test particles in the metric of a localized and slowly rotating astronomical source, within the framework of linear gravitoelectromagnetism, grounded on a Post-Minkowskian approximation of general relativity. Special attention is paid to gravitational inductive effects due to time-varying gravitomagnetic fields. We show that, within the limits of the approximation mentioned above, there are cumulative effects on the orbit of the particles either for planetary sources or for binary systems. They turn out to be negligible.
In this work we study the dynamics of the Schrödinger–Newton (SN) equation upon different choices of initial conditions. Setting up superpositions of Gaussian-like wave packages, a very rich behavior for the critical mass as a function of the parameters of the problem is observed. We find that, for certain values of the parameters, the critical mass is smaller than the critical mass for the system whose initial condition is a single Gaussian wave package, which was the situation previously investigated in the literature. This opens a possibility that more complex initial conditions could in fact produce a significant decrease in the value of the critical mass, which could imply that the SN approach could be tested experimentally. Our conclusions rely on both numerical and analytic estimates. Furthermore, a detailed numerical study is carried out in order to investigate finite-size effects on the simulations, refining earlier results already published. In order to facilitate the reproducibility of our results, a detailed description of our numerical methods has been included in the presentation.
In the present paper we analyze the geodesic structure of black hole spacetime in massive gravity with the scalar charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> representing the modification to Einstein’s general relativity. By solving the geodesic equation and analyzing the behavior of effective potential, we investigate the time-like geodesic types of the test particle around a black hole in massive gravity. At the same time, all kinds of orbits, which are allowed according to the energy levels of the effective potential, are numerically simulated in detail.
In the present work, particle creation mechanism has been employed to the Universe as a thermodynamical system. The Universe is considered to be a spatially flat FRW model and cosmic fluid is chosen as a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state—<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p=(\gamma -1)\rho \)</span>. By proper choice of the particle creation rate, expressions for the entropy and temperature have been determined at various stages of evolution of the Universe. Finally, using the deceleration parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> as a function of the redshift parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> based on recent observations, the particle creation rate has been evaluated and its variation at different epochs have been shown graphically.
Following on from two recent papers, here we examine the relationship between Newtonian gravitation and general relativity in more depth. This allows us to define a scalar potential which is just the proper time of the vector potential when the latter is interpreted as the geodesic velocity field. The results are closely related to spacetimes that admit Painlevé–Gullstrand synchronization.
As quotient spaces, Minkowski and de Sitter are fundamental, non-gravitational spacetimes for the construction of physical theories. When general relativity is constructed on a de Sitter spacetime, the usual Riemannian structure is replaced by a more general structure called de Sitter–Cartan geometry. In the contraction limit of an infinite cosmological term, the de Sitter–Cartan spacetime reduces to a singular, flat, conformal invariant four-dimensional cone spacetime, in which our ordinary notions of time interval and space distance are absent. It is shown that such spacetime satisfies all properties, including the Weyl curvature hypothesis, necessary to play the role of the bridging spacetime connecting two aeons in Penrose’s conformal cyclic cosmology.
The “cosmic censorship conjecture” asserts that all singularities arising from gravitational collapse are hidden within black holes. We investigate this conjecture in a setup of interest for tests of general relativity: black hole solutions which are parametrically small deviations away from the Kerr solution. These solutions have an upper bound on rotation, beyond which a naked singularity is visible to outside observers. We study whether these (generic) spacetimes can be spun-up past extremality with point particles or accretion disks. Our results show that cosmic censorship is preserved for generic parameterizations. We also present examples of special geometries which <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">can</em> be spun-up past extremality.
The effects of quantum gravity at very high energy are necessary to modify the thermodynamics of the early universe. Hence the generalized dispersion relation, as a general characteristic of all theories of quantum gravity, provides the framework for a modification in the thermodynamics of the universe. Here, using the generalized dispersion relation and the modified entropy we employ a cosmological vector field model to obtain the generalized Friedmann equation.
We analyze the low frequency absorption cross section of minimally coupled massless scalar fields by different kinds of charged static black holes in string theory, namely the D1–D5 system in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(d=5\)</span> and a four dimensional dyonic four-charged black hole. In each case we show that this cross section always has the form of some parameter of the solution divided by the black hole Hawking temperature. We also verify in each case that, despite its explicit temperature dependence, such quotient is finite in the extremal limit, giving a well defined cross section. We show that this precise explicit temperature dependence also arises in the same cross section for black holes with string <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha '\)</span> corrections: it is actually induced by them.
An outstanding question lying at the core of the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory is the holographic prescription problem for Einstein metrics, which asserts that one can slightly perturb the conformal geometry at infinity of the anti-de Sitter space and still obtain an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime that satisfies the Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant. The purpose of this paper is to address this question by providing a precise quantitative statement of the real-time holographic principle for Einstein spacetimes, to outline its proof and to discuss its physical implications.
When dealing with a spacetime, one usually searches for singularities, black holes, white holes and wormholes due to their importance to the motion of particles. There is a family of solution of the Brans–Dicke vacuum equations that has not been fully studied from this perspective. In this paper, I study some properties of this family and find the complete set of solutions that avoids singularity at the point where the metric diverges or degenerates. The possible changes in the metric signature when passing through this point is analyzed. In addition, I also study the radial geodesics and obtain the solutions of some particular cases.
A conjecture related to the Bartnik quasilocal mass, is that the infimum of the ADM energy, over an appropriate space of extensions to a compact 3-manifold with boundary, is realised by a static metric. It was shown by Corvino (Commun Math Phys 214(1):137–189, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">2000</a></span>) that if the infimum is indeed achieved, then it is achieved by a static metric; however, the more difficult question of whether or not the infimum is achieved, is still an open problem. Bartnik (Commun Anal Geom 13(5):845–885, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2005</a></span>) then proved that critical points of the ADM mass, over the space of solutions to the Einstein constraints on an asymptotically flat manifold without boundary, correspond to stationary solutions. In that article, he stated that it should be possible to use a similar construction to provide a more natural proof of Corvino’s result. In the first part of this note, we discuss the required modifications to Bartnik’s argument to adapt it to include a boundary. Assuming that certain results concerning a Hilbert manifold structure for the space of solutions carry over to the case considered here, we then demonstrate how Bartnik’s proof can be modified to consider the simpler case of scalar-flat extensions and obtain Corvino’s result. In the second part of this note, we consider a space of extensions in a fixed conformal class. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the infimum is realised within this class.
We present a relativistic model describing a thin disk system composed of two fluids. The system is surrounded by a halo in the presence of a non-trivial electromagnetic field. We show that the model is compatible with the variational multifluid thermodynamics formalism, allowing us to determine all the thermodynamic variables associated with the matter content of the disk. The asymptotic behavior of these quantities indicates that the single fluid interpretation should be abandoned in favor of a two-fluid model.
Hartle’s slow rotation formalism is developed in the presence of a cosmological constant. We find the generalisation of the Hartle–Thorne vacuum metric, the Hartle–Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric, and find that it is always asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter. Next we consider Wahlquist’s rotating perfect fluid interior solution in Hartle’s formalism and discuss its matching to the Hartle–Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric. It is known that the Wahlquist solution cannot be matched to an asymptotically flat region and therefore does not provide a model of an isolated rotating body in this context. However, in the presence of a cosmological term, we find that it can be matched to an asymptotic (anti)-de Sitter space and we are able to interpret the Wahlquist solution as a model of an isolated rotating body, to second order in the angular velocity.
The detection of gravitational wave usually requires to match the measurement data with a large number of templates, which is computationally very expensive. Compressed sensing methods allow one to match the data with a small number of templates and interpolate the rest. However, the interpolation process is still computationally expensive. In this article, we designed a novel method that only requires to match the data with a few templates, yet without needing any interpolation process. The algorithm worked well for signals with relatively high SNRs. It also showed promise for low SNRs signals.
We apply as selection rule to determine the unknown functions of a cosmological model the existence of Lie point symmetries for the Wheeler–DeWitt equation of quantum gravity. Our cosmological setting consists of a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric having the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>), a scalar field with potential function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V(\phi )\)</span> minimally coupled to gravity and a vector field of its kinetic energy is coupled with the scalar field by a coupling function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(\phi )\)</span>. Then, the Lie symmetries of this dynamical system are investigated by utilizing the behavior of the corresponding minisuperspace under the infinitesimal generator of the desired symmetries. It is shown that by applying the Lie symmetry condition the form of the coupling function and also the scalar field potential function may be explicitly determined so that we are able to solve the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. Finally, we show how we can use the Lie symmetries in order to construct conservation laws and exact solutions for the field equations.
We analyze the dynamics of nonspherical acoustic perturbations of the transonic Bondi flow, describing the steady radial accretion of a polytropic perfect fluid into a gravity center. The propagation of such perturbations can be described by a wave equation on the curved effective background geometry determined by the acoustic metric introduced by Unruh in the context of experimental black hole evaporation. We show that for the transonic Bondi flow, Unruh’s acoustic metric describes an analogue black hole and that the acoustic perturbations undergo quasi-normal oscillations. The associated quasi-normal frequencies are computed and they are proven to scale like the surface gravity of the acoustic black hole. This provides an explanation for results given in an earlier work, where it was shown that the acoustic perturbations of a relativistic fluid accreted by a nonrotating black hole possess quasi-normal modes, and where it was found empirically that the associated frequencies scaled like the surface gravity of the analogue black hole in the limit where the radius of the sonic horizon is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius.
Motivated by the mathematic theory of split-complex numbers (or hyperbolic numbers, also perplex numbers) and the split-quaternion numbers (or coquaternion numbers), we define the notion of split-complex scalar field and the split-quaternion scalar field. Then we explore the cosmic evolution of these scalar fields in the background of spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker Universe. We find that both the quintessence field and the phantom field could naturally emerge in these scalar fields. Introducing the metric of field space, these theories fall into a subclass of the multi-field theories which have been extensively studied in inflationary cosmology.
We obtain solutions of Einstein’s equations describing gravitational field outside a noncanonical global monopole with cosmological constant. In particular, we consider two models of k-monopoles: the Dirac–Born–Infeld and the power-law types, and study their corresponding exterior gravitational fields. For each model we found two types of solutions. The first of which are global k-monopole black hole with conical global topology. These are generalizations of the Barriola–Vilenkin solution of global monopole. The appearance of noncanonical kinetic terms does not modify the critical symmetry-breaking scale, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\eta _{crit}\)</span>, but it does affect the corresponding horizon(s). The second type of solution is compactification, whose topology is a product of two 2-dimensional spaces with constant curvatures; <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathcal Y}_4\rightarrow {\mathcal Z}_2\times S^2\)</span>, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathcal Y}, {\mathcal Z}\)</span> can be de Sitter, Minkowski, or Anti-de Sitter, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(S^2\)</span> is the 2-sphere. We investigate all possible compactifications and show that the nonlinearity of kinetic terms opens up new channels which are otherwise non-existent. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda =0\)</span> four-dimensional geometry, we conjecture that these compactification channels are their (possible) non-static super-critical states, right before they undergo topological inflation.
Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully pointed out that for a sufficiently old black hole (BH), the set of assumptions known as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">complementarity postulates</em> appears to be inconsistent with the assumption of local regularity at the horizon. They concluded that the horizon of an old BH is likely to be the locus of local irregularity, a “firewall”. Here I point out that if one adopts a different assumption, namely that semiclassical physics holds throughout its anticipated domain of validity, then the inconsistency is avoided, and the horizon retains its regularity. In this alternative view-point, the vast portion of the original BH information remains trapped inside the BH throughout the semiclassical domain of evaporation, and possibly leaks out later on. This appears to be an inevitable outcome of semiclassical gravity (if assumed to apply throughout its anticipated domain of validity).
The gravitational collapse of a spherical core, in which the fluid component interact with a growing vacuum energy density, filling an homogeneous and isotropic geometry with an arbitrary curvature parameter, is investigated. The complete set of exact solutions for all values of the free parameters are obtained, and the influence of the curvature term on the collapsing time, black hole mass and other physical quantities are also discussed in detail. We show that for the same initial conditions the total black hole mass depends only on the effective matter density parameter (including the vacuum component). It is also shown that the analytical condition to form a black hole, i.e. the formation of an apparent horizon, is not altered by the contribution of the curvature terms, however, the remaining physical quantities are quantitatively modified.
We undertake a hydrodynamical study of a mixture of tightly coupled primordial radiation, neutrinos, baryons, electrons and positrons, together with a gas of already decoupled dark matter WIMPS and an already existing “frozen” magnetic field in the infinite conductivity regime. Considering this cosmic fluid as the source of a homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi I model, we describe its interaction with the magnetic field by means of suitable equations of state that are appropriate for the particle species of the mixture between the end of the leptonic era and the beginning of the radiation-dominated epoch. Fulfilment of observational bounds on the magnetic field intensity yields a “near FLRW” (but strictly non-perturbative) evolution of the geometric, kinematic and thermodynamical variables. This evolution is roughly comparable to the weak field approximation in linear perturbations on a spatially flat FLRW background of sources in which the frozen magnetic fields are coherent over very large supra-horizon scales. Our approach and results may provide interesting guidelines in potential situations in which non-perturbative methods are required to study the interaction between magnetic fields and the cosmic fluid.
In de Sitter (dS) special relativity (SR), two kinds of conserved currents are derived. The first kind is a 5-dimensional dS-covariant angular momentum (AM) current, which unites the energy-momentum (EM) and 4d AM current in an inertial-type coordinate system. The second kind is a dS-invariant AM current, which can be generalized to a conserved current for the coupling system of the matter field and gravitational field in dS gravity. Moreover, an inherent EM tensor is predicted, which comes from the spin part of the dS-covariant current. All the above results are compared to the ordinary SR with Lorentz invariance.
Non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes with central point-like repulsive gravity sources are investigated. Both the symmetries of spacetime and the degree of irregularity of curvature invariants, are the same as for the Schwarzschild case. The equilibrium configurations are modelled using the neutron star polytrope equation of state.
I introduce a covariant four-vector <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathcal {G}^a[v]}\)</span>, which can be interpreted as the momentum density attributed to the spacetime geometry by an observer with velocity <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(v^a\)</span>, and describe its properties: (a) Demanding that the total momentum of matter plus geometry is conserved for all observers, leads to the gravitational field equations. Thus, how matter curves spacetime is entirely determined by this principle of momentum conservation. (b) The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathcal {G}^a[v]}\)</span> can be related to the gravitational Lagrangian in a manner similar to the usual definition of Hamiltonian in, say, classical mechanics. (c) Geodesic observers in a spacetime will find that the conserved total momentum vanishes on-shell. (d) The on-shell, conserved, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">total</em> energy in a region of space, as measured by comoving observers, will be equal to the total heat energy of the boundary surface. (e) The off-shell <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">gravitational energy</em> in a region will be the sum of the ADM energy in the bulk plus the thermal energy of the boundary. These results suggest that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({\mathcal {G}^a[v]}\)</span> can be a useful physical quantity to probe the gravitational theories.
The curvaton reheating mechanism in a scale invariant two measures theory defined in terms of two independent non-Riemannian volume forms (alternative generally covariant integration measure densities) on the space-time manifold which are metric independent is studied. The model involves two scalar matter fields, a dilaton, that transforms under scale transformations and it will be used also as the inflaton of the model and another scalar, which does not transform under scale transformations and which will play the role of a curvaton field. Potentials of appropriate form so that the pertinent action is invariant under global Weyl-scale symmetry are introduced. Scale invariance is spontaneously broken upon integration of the equations of motion. After performing transition to the physical Einstein frame we obtain: (1) For given value of the curvaton field an effective potential for the scalar field with two flat regions for the dilaton which allows for a unified description of both early universe inflation as well as of present dark energy epoch; (2) In the phase corresponding to the early universe, the curvaton has a constant mass and can oscillate decoupled from the dilaton and that can be responsible for both reheating and perturbations in the theory. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">In this framework, we obtain some interesting constraints on different parameters that appear in our model</em>; (3) For a definite parameter range the model possesses a non-singular “emergent universe” solution which describes an initial phase of evolution that precedes the inflationary phase. Finally we discuss generalizations of the model, through the effect of higher curvature terms, where inflaton and curvaton can have coupled oscillations.
We consider a model quantum field theory with a scalar quantum field in de Sitter space-time in a Bohmian version with a field ontology, i.e., an actual field configuration <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varphi (\mathbf{x},t)\)</span> guided by a wave function on the space of field configurations. We analyze the asymptotics at late times (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(t\rightarrow \infty \)</span>) and provide reason to believe that for more or less any wave function and initial field configuration, every Fourier coefficient <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varphi _\mathbf{k}(t)\)</span> of the field is asymptotically of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(c_\mathbf{k}\sqrt{1+\mathbf{k}^2 \exp (-2Ht)/H^2}\)</span>, where the limiting coefficients <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(c_\mathbf{k}=\varphi _\mathbf{k}(\infty )\)</span> are independent of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em> is the Hubble constant quantifying the expansion rate of de Sitter space-time. In particular, every field mode <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\varphi _\mathbf{k}\)</span> possesses a limit as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(t\rightarrow \infty \)</span> and thus “freezes.” This result is relevant to the question whether Boltzmann brains form in the late universe according to this theory, and supports that they do not.
We focus on the HR of massive vector (spin-1) particles tunneling from Schwarzschild BH expressed in the Kruskal–Szekeres and dynamic Lemaitre coordinates. Using the Proca equation together with the Hamilton–Jacobi and the WKB methods, we show that the tunneling rate, and its consequence Hawking temperature are well recovered by the quantum tunneling of the massive vector particles.
EmphasisTypeItalic ">Absolute space</em> is eliminated from the body of mechanics by gauging translations and rotations in the Lagrangian of a classical system. The procedure implies the addition of compensating terms to the kinetic energy, in such a way that the resulting equations of motion are valid in any frame. The compensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathbf{P}\)</span>, intrinsic angular momentum <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span> and intrinsic inertia tensor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathbf{I}\)</span>. Therefore, the privileged frames where Newton’s equations are valid (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Newtonian</em> frames) are completely determined by the matter distribution of the universe (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Machianization</em>). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first class constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once the absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical mechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances between particles. It is also Machian, since the rotation of the rest of the universe produces centrifugal effects. It then provides a new perspective to consider the foundational ideas of general relativity, like Mach’s principle and the weak equivalence principle. With regard to the concept of time, the absence of an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absolute time</em> is known to be a characteristic of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">parametrized</em> systems. Furthermore, the scale invariance of those parametrized systems whose potentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances can be also gauged by introducing another compensating term associated with the intrinsic virial <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">shape-dynamics</em>).
We present the ultrarelativistic boost of the general global monopole solution which is parametrized by mass and deficit solid angle. The problem is addressed from two different perspectives. In the first one the primary object for performing the boost is the metric tensor while in the second one the energy momentum tensor is used. Since the solution is sourced by a triplet of scalar fields that effectively vanish in the boosting limit we investigate the behavior of a scalar field in a simpler setup. Namely, we perform the boosting study of the spherically symmetric solution with a free scalar field given by Janis, Newman and Winicour. The scalar field is again vanishing in the limit pointing to a broader pattern of scalar field behaviour during an ultrarelativistic boost in highly symmetric situations.
We investigate the qualitative evolution of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((D+1)\)</span>-dimensional cosmological models in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\textit{f(R)}\)</span> gravity for the general case of the function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\textit{f(R)}\)</span>. The analysis is specified for various examples, including the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\((D+1)\)</span>-dimensional generalization of the Starobinsky model, models with polynomial and exponential functions. The cosmological dynamics are compared in the Einstein and Jordan representations of the corresponding scalar-tensor theory. The features of the cosmological evolution are discussed for Einstein frame potentials taking negative values in certain regions of the field space.
In this paper, we have studied non stationary dust spherically symmetric spacetime, in general covariant theory [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>(1) extension] of the Hořava–Lifshitz gravity with the minimally coupling and non-minimum coupling with matter, in the post-newtonian approximation in the infrared limit. The Newtonian prepotential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varphi \)</span> was assumed null. The aim of this work is to know if we can have the same spacetime, as we know in the General Relativity Theory (GRT), in Hořava–Lifshitz Theory (HLT) in this limit. We have shown that there is not an analogy of the dust solution in HLT with the minimally coupling, as in GRT. Using non-minimum coupling with matter, we have shown that the solution admits a process of gravitational collapse, leaving a singularity at the end. This solution has, qualitatively, the same temporal behaviour as the dust collapse in GRT. However, we have also found a second possible solution, representing a bounce behavior that is not found in GRT.
We compute the area (or entropy) product formula for a regular black hole derived by Ayón-Beato and García (Phys Rev Lett 80:5056, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8">1998</a></span>). By explicit and exact calculation, it is shown that the entropy product formula of two physical horizons strictly <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">depends</em> upon the ADM mass parameter that means it is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> an universal (mass-independent) quantity. But a slightly more complicated function of event horizon area and Cauchy horizon area is indeed a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mass-independent</em> quantity. We also compute other thermodynamic properties of the said black hole. We further study the stability of such black hole by computing the specific heat for both the horizons. It has been observed that under certain condition the black hole possesses second order phase transition. The pictorial diagram of the phase transition is given.
Considering the quantum gravity effect, we investigate the quantum tunneling from a high dimensional Kerr-Gödel black hole using a generalized Dirac equation. As a result, revised tunneling probability is obtained, and the corrected Hawking temperature is also presented.
In the usual 5-dimensional Randall–Sundrum scenario with warped geometry of the extra compact dimension, the Goldberger–Wise mechanism for stabilisation of the radius of compactification can lead to a scalar field called the radion. The radion can have implications in TeV-scale physics, which can be especially noticeable if its vacuum expectation value (vev) is not far above a TeV. However a large mass of the first graviton excitation, which seems to be suggested by recent search limit, tends to make the radion vev, far too large in the minimal model. We show that this is not the case if a Gauss–Bonnet term, containing higher powers of the curvature, is present in the 5-dimensional action. As a result, a radion with vev in the range 1.7–4.0 TeV can be consistent with the first graviton excitation mass well above the bound set by LHC experiments.
We examine in a semiclassical framework the deflection function of strong gravitational lensing, for static and spherically symmetric black holes, endowed with a photon sphere. From a first-order WKB analysis near the maximum of the Regge-Wheeler potential, we extract the real phase shifts from the S-matrix elements and then we derive the associated semiclassical deflection function, characterized by a logarithmic divergent behavior. More precisely, using the complex angular momentum techniques, we show that the Regge poles and the associated greybody factor residues, for a massless scalar field theory, from which one can recover the black hole quasinormal complex frequencies as well as the fluctuations of the high energy absorption cross section, play naturally the role of critical parameters in the divergent behavior of the semiclassical deflection function. For very high frequencies, we finally recover the logarithmic part of the classical strong deflection limit, which clarifies analytically the fundamental link between quasinormal modes and strong gravitational lensing, suggested in recent works.
Using the Newman and Penrose spin coefficient (NP) formalism, we provide a derivation of the Dyer–Roeder equation for the angular diameter distance in cosmological space-times. We show that the geodesic deviation equation written in NP formalism is precisely the Dyer–Roeder equation for a general Friedman–Robertson–Walker (FRW) space-time, and then we examine the angular diameter distance to redshift relation in the case that a flat FRW metric is perturbed by a gravitational potential. We examine the perturbation in the case that the gravitational potential exhibits the properties of a thin gravitational lens, demonstrating how the weak lensing shear and convergence act as source terms for the perturbed Dyer–Roeder equation.
ABG black holes are charged regular black holes based on Einstein gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics, proposed by Ayón-Beato and García. In 2005, they generalized the ABG black holes to a new class of regular black holes which have four characteristic parameters: the mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, the electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> and the rest two parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\alpha \)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\beta \)</span> related with the dipole and quadrupole moment of the nonlinear electromagnetic field, respectively. In this paper, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of these generalized ABG black holes for scalar and gravitational perturbations by the sixth-order WKB method. The numerical results show the generalized ABG black holes are stable and the relations between QNMs and the parameter of the perturbation fields and the parameters of the black holes are discussed. The real part and the imaginary part of the generalized ABG black holes increase as the charge increasing. Furthermore, the dependence of the QNMs on the other parameters is also illustrated and the analytical expression of the quasinormal frequency for the large multipole index is obtained.
The Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) theory is realized by adding the CS deformation term, the higher derivative deformation term, and an extra term to pure Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. In the present paper we obtain exact solutions to the GMMG field equations in the non-linear regime of the model. GMMG model about <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(AdS_3\)</span> space is conjectured to be dual to a 2-dimensional CFT. We study the theory in critical points corresponding to the central charges <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(c_-=0\)</span> or <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(c_+=0\)</span>, in the non-linear regime. We show that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(AdS_3\)</span> wave solutions are present, and have logarithmic form in critical points. Then we study the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(AdS_3\)</span> non-linear deformation solution. Furthermore we obtain logarithmic deformation of extremal BTZ black hole. After that using Abbott–Deser–Tekin method we calculate the energy and angular momentum of these types of black hole solutions.
The entanglement entropy of a free quantum field in a coherent state is independent of its stress energy content. We use this result to highlight the fact that while the Einstein equations for first order variations about a locally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields seem to follow from Jacobson’s principle of maximal vacuum entanglement entropy, their possible derivation from this principle for the physically relevant case of finite but small variations remains an open issue. We also apply this result to the context of Bianchi’s identification, independent of unknown Planck scale physics, of the first order variation of Bekenstein–Hawking area with that of vacuum entanglement entropy. We argue that under certain technical assumptions this identification seems not to be extendible to the context of finite but small variations to coherent states. Our particular method of estimation of entanglement entropy variation reveals the existence of certain contributions over and above those of References Jacobson (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04753"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1505.04753</span></a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2015</a></span>), Bianchi (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0522"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1211.0522</span></a></span> [gr-qc], <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2012</a></span>). We discuss the sense in which these contributions may be subleading to those in References Jacobson (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04753"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1505.04753</span></a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2015</a></span>), Bianchi (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0522"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1211.0522</span></a></span> [gr-qc], <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2012</a></span>).
In this work we explore the viability of nonminimally coupled matter-curvature gravity theories, namely the conditions required for the absence of tachyon instabilities and ghost degrees of freedom. We contrast our finds with recent claims of a pathological behaviour of this class of models, which resorted to, in our view, an incorrect analogy with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>-essence.
We find a new class of charged rotating dilaton black string solutions in the presence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics. The dilaton potential is chosen in the form of the Liouville-type. We also present the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of dilaton potential. We find the conserved and thermodynamic quantities and check that the first law of thermodynamics holds on the black string horizon. We also address some theoretical implications of the nonlinear black hole/string solutions.
It is shown that the Unruh effect, i.e. the increase in temperature indicated by a uniformly accelerated thermometer in an inertial vacuum state of a quantum field, cannot be interpreted as the result of an exchange of heat with a surrounding gas. Since the vacuum is spatially homogeneous in the accelerated system its temperature must be zero everywhere as a consequence of Tolman’s law. In fact, the increase of temperature of accelerated thermometers is due to systematic quantum effects induced by the local coupling between the thermometer and the vacuum. This coupling inevitably creates excitations of the vacuum which transfer energy to the thermometer, gained by the acceleration, and thereby affect its readings. The temperature of the vacuum, however, remains to be zero for arbitrary accelerations.
As proposed by Bambi and Modesto, rotating non-singular black holes can be constructed via the Newman–Janis algorithm. Here we show that if one starts with a modified Hayward black hole with a time delay in the centre, the algorithm succeeds in producing a rotating metric, but curvature divergences reappear. To preserve finiteness, the time delay must be introduced directly at the level of the non-singular rotating metric. This is possible thanks to the deformation of the inner stationarity limit surface caused by the regularisation, and in more than one way. We outline three different possibilities, distinguished by the angular velocity of the event horizon. Along the way, we provide additional results on the Bambi–Modesto rotating Hayward metric, such as the structure of the regularisation occurring at the centre, the behaviour of the quantum gravity scale alike an electric charge in decreasing the angular momentum of the extremal black hole configuration, or details on the deformation of the ergosphere.
We analyse the evolution of scalar field dark energy in the spherical halos of dark matter at the late stages of formation of gravitationally bound systems in the expanding Universe. The dynamics of quintessential dark energy at the center of dark matter halo strongly depends on the value of effective sound speed <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(c_s\)</span> (in units of speed of light). If <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(c_s\sim 1\)</span> (classical scalar field) then the dark energy in the gravitationally bound systems is only slightly perturbed and its density is practically the same as in cosmological background. The dark energy with small value of sound speed (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(c_s&lt;0.1\)</span>), on the contrary, is important dynamical component of halo at all stages of their evolution: linear, non-linear, turnaround, collapse, virialization and later up to current epoch. These properties of dark energy can be used for constraining the value of effective sound speed <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(c_s\)</span> by comparison the theoretical predictions with observational data related to the large scale gravitationally bound systems.
The causal dynamical triangulations approach aims to construct a quantum theory of gravity as the continuum limit of a lattice-regularized model of dynamical geometry. A renormalization group scheme—in concert with finite size scaling analysis—is essential to this aim. Formulating and implementing such a scheme in the present context raises novel and notable conceptual and technical problems. I explored these problems, and, building on standard techniques, suggested potential solutions in a previous paper (Cooperman, <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/1410.0026"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:gr-qc/1410.0026</span></a></span>). As an application of these solutions, I now propose a renormalization group scheme for causal dynamical triangulations. This scheme differs significantly from that studied recently by Ambjørn, Görlich, Jurkiewicz, Kreienbuehl, and Loll.
Maxwell’s equations cannot describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a uniformly distributed net charge, because the electromagnetic field tensor in such a universe must be vanishing everywhere. For a closed universe with a nonzero net charge, Maxwell’s equations always fail regardless of the spacetime symmetry and the charge distribution. The two paradoxes indicate that Maxwell’s equations need be modified to be applicable to the universe as a whole. We consider two types of modified Maxwell equations, both can address the paradoxes. One is the Proca-type equation which contains a photon mass term. This type of electromagnetic field equations can naturally arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in quantum field theory, where photons acquire a mass by eating massless Goldstone bosons. However, photons loose their mass again when the symmetry is restored, and the paradoxes reappear. The other type of modified Maxwell equations, which are more attractive in our opinions, contain a term with the electromagnetic field potential vector coupled to the spacetime curvature tensor. This type of electromagnetic field equations do not introduce a new dimensional parameter and return to Maxwell’s equations in a flat or Ricci-flat spacetime. We show that the curvature-coupled term can naturally arise from the ambiguity in extending Maxwell’s equations from a flat spacetime to a curved spacetime through the “minimal substitution rule”. Some consequences of the modified Maxwell equations are investigated. The results show that for reasonable parameters the modification does not affect existing experiments and observations. However, we argue that, the field equations with a curvature-coupled term can be testable in astrophysical environments where the mass density is high or the gravity of electromagnetic radiations plays a dominant role in dynamics, e.g., the interior of neutron stars and the early universe.
We wish to construct a minimal set of algebraically independent scalar curvature invariants formed by the contraction of the Riemann (Ricci) tensor and its covariant derivatives up to some order of differentiation in three dimensional (3D) Lorentzian spacetimes. In order to do this we utilize the Cartan–Karlhede equivalence algorithm since, in general, all Cartan invariants are related to scalar polynomial curvature invariants. As an example we apply the algorithm to the class of 3D Szekeres cosmological spacetimes with comoving dust and cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>. In this case, we find that there are at most twelve algebraically independent Cartan invariants, including <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>. We present these Cartan invariants, and we relate them to twelve independent scalar polynomial curvature invariants (two, four and six, respectively, zeroth, first, and second order scalar polynomial curvature invariants).
We investigate cosmological evolution in the scalar–tensor theory with the field derivative coupling to the double-dual of the Riemann tensor (the cubic-type theory). The theory can be seen as the straightforward extension of the scalar–tensor with the quadratic order field derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor (the quadratic-type theory). Both the field derivative couplings to the Einstein tensor and the double-dual of the Riemann tensor have been argued in terms of the successful realization of the self-tuning of the cosmological constant within the Horndeski theory. Assuming the constant potential given by the sum of the cosmological constant and the quantum vacuum energy, the shift symmetry for the scalar field and no matter fields, in the spatially-flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker spacetime, we can reduce the set of the field equations to the first-order ordinary nonlinear differential equation for the Hubble parameter, showing the existence of the self-tuned and runaway de Sitter solutions, in addition to the standard de Sitter solutions in general relativity and the finite Hubble singularities which can be reached within the finite time. We then argue the possible cosmological evolution in terms of the values of the effective cosmological constant, the kinetic coupling constants and the initial Hubble parameter. Although the behavior of the universe around each of the de Sitter solutions as well as the finite time singularities is very similar in both theories, we find that the crucial difference appears in terms of no bounce or turnaround behavior across the vanishing Hubble parameter as well as no limitation for the range of the Hubble parameter in the cubic-type theory.
Instead of the scalar “dilaton” field that is usually adopted to construct conformally invariant Lagrangians for gravitation, we here propose a hybrid construction, involving both a complex dilaton scalar and a Weyl gauge-vector, in accord with Weyl’s original concept of a non-Riemannian conformal geometry with a transport law for length and time intervals, for which this gauge vector is required. Such a hybrid construction permits us to avoid the wrong sign of the dilaton kinetic term (the ghost problem) that afflicts the usual construction. The introduction of a Weyl gauge-vector and its interaction with the dilaton also has the collateral benefit of providing an explicit mechanism for spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry, whereby the dilaton and the Weyl gauge-vector acquire masses somewhat smaller than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\textit{m}_\textit{P}\)</span> by the Coleman–Weinberg mechanism. Conformal symmetry breaking is assumed to precede inflation, which occurs later by a separate GUT or electroweak symmetry breaking, as in inflationary models based on the Higgs boson.
Dilaton black hole solutions in low energy string theory (well known as GMGHS black holes) have analogue black holes with a cosmological constant derived by Gao and Zhang. Here, we study quasi normal modes of this dilaton-de Sitter black hole under neutral scalar field perturbations. We have employed the sixth order WKB analysis to compute the quasi normal mode frequencies. A detailed study is done for the quasi normal mode frequencies by varying the parameters in the theory such as the mass, cosmological constant, dilaton charge and the spherical harmonic index. For the massive scalar field we observed that the usual quasi resonance modes that exists for asymptotically flat black holes do not exist for this particular black hole. We have approximated the scalar field potential of the near-extreme dilaton de Sitter black hole with the Pöschl-Teller potential and have presented exact quasi normal frequencies.
Scalar field dark energy cosmology has been investigated in the present paper in the frame work of Einstein gravity. In the context of Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker space time minimally coupled scalar field with self interacting potential and non-interacting perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state (dark matter) is chosen as the matter context. By imposing Noether symmetry on the Lagrangian of the system the symmetry vector is obtained and the self interacting potential for the scalar field is determined. Then we choose a point transformation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((a, \phi )\rightarrow (u, v)\)</span> such that one of the transformation variable (say <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">u</em>) is cyclic for the Lagrangian. Subsequently, using conserved charge (corresponding to the cyclic co-ordinate) and the constant of motion, solutions are obtained. Finally, the cosmological implication of the solutions in the perspective of recent observation has been examined.
Recently, the cosmological deceleration-acceleration transition redshift in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity has been considered in order to address consistently the problem of cosmic evolution. It is possible to show that the deceleration parameter changes sign at a given redshift according to observational data. Furthermore, a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane system starting from the very early universe and accounting for the cosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late time acceleration. Here we propose a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) model where transition redshifts correspond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration transitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was born, due to the transition of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em> black fundamental strings to the BIon configuration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with reducing temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((z\sim T^{2})\)</span>. The BIon is a configuration in flat space of a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole. This wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our universe, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(z\sim T^{4+1/7}\)</span>. Dynamics consists with the fact that the wormhole misses its energy and vanishes as soon as inflation ends and deceleration begins. Approaching two universe branes together, a tachyon is originated, it grows up and causes the formation of a wormhole. We show that, in the framework of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, the cosmological redshift depends on the tachyonic potential and has a significant decrease at deceleration-late time acceleration transition point <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\((z\sim T^{2/3})\)</span>. As soon as today acceleration approaches, the redshift tends to zero and the cosmological model reduces to the standard <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM cosmology.
Thus far, there does not appear to be an agreed (or adequate) definition of homogeneous dark energy (DE). This paper seeks to define a valid, adequate homogeneity condition for DE. Firstly, it is shown that as long as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(w_x \ne -1\)</span>, DE must have perturbations. It is then argued, independent of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(w_x\)</span>, that a correct definition of homogeneous DE is one whose density perturbation vanishes in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">comoving</em> gauge: and hence, in the DE rest frame. Using phenomenological DE, the consequence of this approach is then investigated in the observed galaxy power spectrum—with the power spectrum being normalized on small scales, at the present epoch <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(z=0\)</span>. It is found that for high magnification bias, relativistic corrections in the galaxy power spectrum are able to distinguish the concordance model from both a homogeneous DE and a clustering DE—on super-horizon scales.
We consider an effective viscous pressure as the result of a backreaction of inhomogeneities within Buchert’s formalism. The use of an effective metric with a time-dependent curvature radius allows us to calculate the luminosity distance of the backreaction model. This quantity is different from its counterpart for a “conventional” spatially flat bulk viscous fluid universe. Both expressions are tested against the SNIa data of the Union2.1 sample with only marginally different results for the distance-redshift relation and in accordance with the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varLambda \)</span>CDM model. Future observations are expected to be able to discriminate among these models on the basis of indirect measurements of the curvature evolution.
Motivated by the wide applications of BTZ black holes and interesting results of gravity’s rainbow, we consider three dimensional rainbow solutions and investigate their thermodynamic properties. In addition to investigate black holes thermodynamics related to AdS/CFT correspondence, one may regard gravity’s rainbow to encode quantum gravity effects into the black hole solutions. We take into account the various models of linear and nonlinear electrodynamics and study their effects on the gravity’s rainbow spacetime. We also examine thermal stability and find that obtained three dimensional rainbow black holes are thermally stable.
We study a class of shear-free, homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models with imperfect matter sources in the context of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. We show that the anisotropic stresses are related to the electric part of the Weyl tensor in such a way that they balance each other. We also show that within the class of orthogonal <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models, small perturbations of shear are damped, and that the electric part of the Weyl tensor and the anisotropic stress tensor decay with the expansion as well as the heat flux of the curvature fluid. Specializing in locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes in orthonormal frames, we examine the late-time behaviour of the de Sitter universe in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. For the Starobinsky model of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>), we study the evolutionary behavior of the Universe by numerically integrating the Friedmann equation, where the initial conditions for the expansion, acceleration and jerk parameters are taken from observational data.
We try to solve the dark matter problem in the fit between theory and the Hubble diagram of supernovae by allowing for torsion via Einstein–Cartan’s gravity and for anisotropy via the axial Bianchi I metric. Otherwise we are conservative and admit only the cosmological constant and dust. The failure of our model is quantified by the relative amount of dust in our best fit: <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Omega _{m0}= 27 \pm \ 5 \,\%\)</span> at 1<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\sigma \)</span> level.
In this paper, we analyze the clustering of galaxies using a modified Newtonian potential. This modification of the Newtonian potential occurs due to the existence of extra dimensions in brane world models. We will analyze a system of galaxies interacting with each other through this modified Newtonian potential. The partition function for this system of galaxies will be calculated, and this partition function will be used to calculate the free energy of this system of galaxies. The entropy and the chemical potential for this system will also be calculated. We will derive explicit expression for the clustering parameter for this system. This parameter will determine the behavior of this system, and we will be able to express various thermodynamic quantities using this clustering parameter. Thus, we will be able to explicitly analyze the effect that modifying the Newtonian potential can have on the clustering of galaxies. We also analyse the effect of extra dimensions on the two-point functions between galaxies.
We study the null geodesics of a four-dimensional magnetic charged black hole spacetime arising in string theory. The behaviour of effective potential in view of the different values of black hole parameters are analysed in the equatorial plane. The possible orbits for null geodesics are also discussed in view of the different values of the impact parameter. We have also calculated the frequency shift of photons in this spacetime. The results are compared to those obtained for the electrically charged stringy black hole spacetime and the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime in general relativity.
We study a binary system composed of point particles of unequal masses in eccentric orbits in the linear regime of the characteristic formulation of general relativity, generalising a previous study found in the literature in which a system of equal masses in circular orbits is considered. We also show that the boundary conditions on the time-like world tubes generated by the orbits of the particles can be extended beyond circular orbits. Concerning the power lost by the emission of gravitational waves, it is directly obtained from the Bondi’s News function. It is worth stressing that our results are completely consistent, because we obtain the same result for the power derived by Peters and Mathews, in a different approach, in their seminal paper of 1963. In addition, the present study constitutes a powerful tool to construct extraction schemes in the characteristic formalism to obtain the gravitational radiation produced by binary systems during the inspiralling phase.
This is an English translation of a paper by Wolfgang Kundt and Manfred Trümper, first published in 1962 in the proceedings of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz (Germany). The original paper was the last of a five-part series of articles containing the first summary of knowledge about exact solutions of Einstein’s equations found until then. (All the other parts of the series have already been re-published as Golden Oldies.) This fifth contribution summarizes key points of the earlier papers and applies them, in particular results from papers II and IV in the series, in the context of the propagation of gravitational radiation when matter is present. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by Malcolm A.H. MacCallum and by a brief autobiography of Manfred Trümper.

It has been suggested that the York parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> (effectively the scalar extrinsic curvature of a spatial hypersurface) may play the role of a fundamental time parameter. In a flat, forever expanding cosmology the York parameter remains always negative, taking values <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(T=-\infty \)</span> at the big bang and approaching some finite non-positive value as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(t\rightarrow \infty \)</span>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> being the usual cosmological time coordinate. Based on previous results concerning a simple, spatially flat cosmological model with a scalar field, we provide a temporal extension of this model to include ‘times’ <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(T&gt;0\)</span>, an epoch not covered by the cosmological time coordinate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>, and discuss the dynamics of this ‘other side’ and its significance. We argue that the extension is necessary if a consistent quantisation scheme is to exist. Furthermore, we investigate which types of potentials lead to smooth transitions, paying particular attention to currently favoured inflaton potentials.
The minimal requirement for cosmography—a non-dynamical description of the universe—is a prescription for calculating null geodesics, and time-like geodesics as a function of their proper time. In this paper, we consider the most general linear connection compatible with homogeneity and isotropy, but not necessarily with a metric. A light-cone structure is assigned by choosing a set of geodesics representing light rays. This defines a “scale factor” and a local notion of distance, as that travelled by light in a given proper time interval. We find that the velocities and relativistic energies of free-falling bodies decrease in time as a consequence of cosmic expansion, but at a rate that can be different than that dictated by the usual metric framework. By extrapolating this behavior to photons’ redshift, we find that the latter is in principle independent of the “scale factor”. Interestingly, redshift–distance relations and other standard geometric observables are modified in this extended framework, in a way that could be experimentally tested. An extremely tight constraint on the model, however, is represented by the blackbody-ness of the cosmic microwave background. Finally, as a check, we also consider the effects of a non-metric connection in a different set-up, namely, that of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime.
We study the space-times admitting a null conformal Killing-Yano tensor whose divergence defines a Killing vector. We analyze the similarities and differences with the recently studied non null case (Ferrando and Sáez in Gen Relativ Gravit 47:1911, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2015</a></span>). The results by Barnes concerning the Birkhoff theorem for the case of null orbits are analyzed and generalized.
We apply the interacting parametrized post-Friedmann (IPPF) method to coupled dark energy models where the interaction is proportional to dark matter density at background level. In the first case, the dark components are treated as fluids and the growth of dark matter perturbations only feel the interaction via the modification of background quantities provided dark matter follows geodesic. We also perform a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo analysis which combines several cosmological probes including the cosmic microwave background (WMAP9<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span>Planck) data, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, JLA sample of supernovae, Hubble constant (HST), and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements through the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathrm{f}\sigma _{8}\mathrm{(z)}\)</span> data points. The joint observational analysis of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathrm{Planck}+\mathrm{WP}+\mathrm{JLA}+\mathrm{BAO}+\mathrm{HST}+ \mathrm{RSD}\)</span> data leads to a coupling parameter, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\xi _{c}=0.00140_{-0.00080}^{+0.00079}\)</span> at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(1\sigma \)</span> level for vanishing momentum transfer potential. On the other hand, we deal with a coupled quintessence model which exhibits a violation of the equivalence principle coming form a coupling term in the modified Euler equation; as a result of that the local Hubble expansion rate and the effective gravitational coupling are both enhanced. Provided that the interaction is parallel to scalar field velocity the momentum transfer potential is switched on, leading to a lower interaction coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\xi _{c}=0.00136_{-0.00073}^{+0.00080}\)</span> at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(1\sigma \)</span> level when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\mathrm{Planck}+\mathrm{WP}+\mathrm{JLA}+\mathrm{BAO}+\mathrm{HST}+\mathrm{RSD}\)</span> data are combined. Besides, the CMB power spectrum shows up a correlation between the coupling parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\xi _{c}\)</span> and the position of acoustic peaks or their amplitudes. The first peak’s height increases when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\xi _{c}\)</span> takes larger values and its position is shifted. We also obtain the matter power spectrum may be affected by the strength of interaction coupling over scales bigger than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(10^{-2} \mathrm{h}~ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\)</span>, reducing its amplitude in relation to the vanilla model.
The quasinormal modes for scalar and spinor fields in the background spacetime corresponding to a black hole with a global monopole in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity are calculated using the WKB approximation. In the obtained results we emphasize the role played by the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\psi _{0}\)</span>, associated with the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. We discuss the appropriate limit <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\psi _{0} \rightarrow 0\)</span>, in which case the results concerning to the Schwarzschild black hole are obtained, as it should be expected.
Introducing the well known Papapetrou field as the gravitoelectromagnetic field tensor, we express the Maxwell-type part of the 3-dimensional quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations in terms of differential forms, analogous to their electromagnetic counterparts in curved spacetimes. Using the same formalism we introduce the junction conditions on non-null hypersurfaces in terms of the introduced gravitoelectromagnetic 4-vector fields and apply them to the case of the Van Stockum interior and exterior solutions.
We point out that in unimodular gravity Newton’s constant is an essential coupling, i.e. it is independent of field redefinitions. We illustrate the consequences of this fact by a calculation in a standard simple approximation, showing that in this case the renormalization group flow of Newton’s constant is gauge and parametrization independent.
We consider generic axially symmetric rotating spacetimes and examine particle collisions in the ergoregion. The results are generic and agree with those obtained in the particular case of the rotating Teo wormhole in Tsukamoto and Bambi, Phys Rev D 91:104040, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23">2015</a></span>. It is shown that for sufficiently rapid rotation, the energy of a particle escaping to infinity can become arbitrary large (so-called super-Penrose process). Moreover, this energy is typically much larger than the center-of mass energy of colliding particles. In this sense the situation differs radically from that for collisions near black holes.
We present here the general expressions for the acceleration of massive test particles along the symmetry axis of the Kerr metric, and then study the main properties of this acceleration in different regions of the spacetime. In particular, we show that there exists a region near the black hole in which the gravitational field is repulsive. We provide possible physical interpretations about the role of this effect in terms of the different conserved parameters. The studies of these geodesics are important not only to understand better the structure of the Kerr spacetime but also to its use as a possible mechanism for the production of extragalactic jets. Our results are obtained with the help of expressing the geodesics of the Kerr spacetime in terms of the Weyl coordinates.
We explore two methods for obtaining solutions for uniformly accelerated motion in general curved spacetime. We provide an example in Schwarzschild spacetime.
Inspired from the idea of minimally coupling of a real scalar field to geometry, we investigate the classical and quantum models of a flat energy-dependent FRW cosmology coupled to a perfect fluid in the framework of the scalar-rainbow metric gravity. We use the standard Schutz’ representation for the perfect fluid and show that under a particular energy-dependent gauge fixing, it may lead to the identification of a time parameter for the corresponding dynamical system. It is shown that, under some circumstances on the minisuperspace prob energy, the classical evolution of the of the universe represents a late time expansion coming from a bounce instead of the big-bang singularity. Then we go forward by showing that this formalism gives rise to a Schrödinger–Wheeler–DeWitt equation for the quantum-mechanical description of the model under consideration, the eigenfunctions of which can be used to construct the wave function of the universe. We use the resulting wave function in order to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects by means of the many-worlds and Bohmian interpretation of quantum cosmology.
It was previously proved that the Gödel-type metrics with flat three-dimensional background metric solve exactly the field equations of the Einstein-Aether theory in four dimensions. We generalize this result by showing that the stationary Gödel-type metrics with nonflat background in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> dimensions solve exactly the field equations of the Einstein-Aether theory. The reduced field equations are the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((D-1)\)</span>-dimensional Euclidean Ricci-flat and the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((D-1)\)</span>-dimensional source-free Maxwell equations, and the parameters of the theory are left free except <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(c_{1}-c_{3}=1\)</span>. We give a method to produce exact solutions of the Einstein-Aether theory from the Gödel-type metrics in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> dimensions. By using this method, we present explicit exact solutions to the theory by considering the particular cases: (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(D-1\)</span>)-dimensional Euclidean flat, conformally flat, and Tangherlini backgrounds.
A gravitational gauge theory with a spin–affine connection (Lorentz connection) as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rotational</em> gauge potential (fundamental dynamical variable) is suggested for reformulating the theory of Stephenson–Kilmister–Yang gravity, in which the Einstein field equation of gravity is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">first-integral solution</em> of a spin-connection gravitational gauge field equation. A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">heavy intermediate field</em> <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\phi \)</span> that accompanies a matter field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varphi \)</span> is introduced in order to remove the conventional dimensionful gravitational coupling. Such a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varphi \)</span>–<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\phi \)</span> coupling can lead to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dimensionless gravitational coupling</em> (i.e., the gravitational constant is dimensionless) in the present gravitational gauge field theory. A low-energy effective Lagrangian density for the matter field can be obtained by integrating out the accompanying heavy field in generating functional of path integral formalism, and therefore, a dimensionful gravitational coupling coefficient (Einstein gravitational constant) emerges. Such a dimensionless coupling of gravity, where the dimensionful coupling is emergent at low energies, is considered for scalar and spinor fields, which serve as gravitating matter fields (gravitational source). Though there are higher derivatives (e.g., third- and fourth-order partial derivatives) of the scalar and spinor fields in the low-energy effective Lagrangian densities, the ordinary equations of motion of the scalar and spinor fields can also be emergent from the present gravitational gauge theory. Therefore, the Einstein gravity can be recovered from the present gravitational gauge theory. In addition to the gravitational Lagrangian of the spacetime-rotational gauge potential (i.e., spin–affine connection), the Lagrangian of a spacetime-translational gauge potential (i.e., vierbein) is also constructed. Thus, the present <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dimensionless gravitational gauge coupling</em> preserves local rotational and translational gauge symmetries. Since the spin-connection gravitational gauge field equation is a third-order differential equation of metric (the Einstein field equation of gravity is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">first-integral solution</em>), it could provide a new route to the vacuum energy cosmological constant problem.
We analyze the properties of a Kerr-like wormhole supported by phantom matter, which is an exact solution of the Einstein-phantom field equations. It is shown that the solution has a naked ring singularity which is unreachable to null geodesics falling freely from the outside. Similarly to Roger Penrose’s cosmic censorship, that states that all naked singularities in the Universe must be protected by event horizons, here we conjecture from our results that a naked singularity can also be fully protected by the intrinsic properties of a wormhole’s throat.
We study the effect of higher-derivative terms on holographic Schwinger effect by introducing the Gauss–Bonnet term in the gravity sector. Anti-de Sitter soliton background is considered which is dual to confining phase of the boundary field theory. By calculating the potential between the produced pair, we find that larger Gauss–Bonnet factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\lambda \)</span> makes the pair lighter. We apply numerical method to calculate the production rate for various cases. The results show that the Gauss–Bonnet term enhances the production rate. The critical behaviors near the two critical values of the electric field are also investigated, and it is found that the two critical indexes are not affected by the Gauss–Bonnet term and thus suggests a possible universality.
In this paper, we study a big bounce universe typified by a non-singular big bounce, as opposed to a singular big bang. This cosmological model can describe radiation dominated early universe and matter dominated late universe in FRW model. The connections between thermodynamics and gravity are observed here. In the early stage of both cold and hot universes, we find there is only one geometry containing a 4D de Sitter universe with a general state parameter. We also find the form of the apparent horizon in the early universe strongly depends on the extra dimension, which suggests that the influence of the extra dimension could in principle be found in the early universe. Moreover, we show that in the late stages of both cold and hot universes, the moment when the apparent horizon begins to bounce keeps essentially in step with the behavior of the cosmological scalar factor.
We investigate the effects of a modified dispersion relation proposed by Majhi and Vagenas on the Reissner–Nordström black hole thermodynamics in a universe with large extra dimensions. It is shown that entropy, temperature and heat capacity receive new corrections and charged black holes in this framework have less degrees of freedom and decay faster compared to black holes in the Hawking picture. We also study the emission rate of black hole and compare our results with other quantum gravity approaches. In this regard, the existence of the logarithmic prefactor and the relation between dimensions and charge are discussed. This procedure is not only valid for a single horizon spacetime but it is also valid for the spacetimes with inner and outer horizons.
The present work investigates the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity models. For a general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory, it is shown analytically that a collapse is quite possible. The singularity formed as a result of the collapse is found to be a curvature singularity of shell focusing type. The possibility of the formation of an apparent horizon hiding the central singularity depends on the initial conditions.
In the case of vanishing cosmological constant, Demiański has shown that the Janis–Newman algorithm can be generalized in order to include a NUT charge and another parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em>, in addition to the angular momentum. Moreover it was proved that only a NUT charge can be added for non-vanishing cosmological constant. However despite the fact that the form of the coordinate transformations was obtained, it was not explained how to perform the complexification on the metric function, and the procedure does not follow directly from the usual Janis–Newman rules. The goal of our paper is threefold: explain the hidden assumptions of Demiański’s analysis, generalize the computations to topological horizons (spherical and hyperbolic) and to charged solutions, and explain how to perform the complexification of the function. In particular we present a new solution which is an extension of the Demiański metric to hyperbolic horizons. These different results open the door to applications on (gauged) supergravity since they allow for a systematic application of the Demiański–Janis–Newman algorithm.
It is generally believed that any quantum theory of gravity should have a generic feature—a quantum of length. We provide a physical ansatz to obtain an effective <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-local</em> metric tensor starting from the standard metric tensor such that the spacetime acquires a zero-point-length <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\ell _0\)</span> of the order of the Planck length <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(L_{P}\)</span>. This prescription leads to several remarkable consequences. In particular, the Euclidean volume <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(V_D(\ell ,\ell _0)\)</span> in a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional spacetime of a region of size <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\ell \)</span> scales as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(V_D(\ell , \ell _0) \propto \ell _0^{D-2} \ell ^2\)</span> when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\ell \sim \ell _0\)</span>, while it reduces to the standard result <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(V_D(\ell ,\ell _0) \propto \ell ^D\)</span> at large scales (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\ell \gg \ell _0\)</span>). The appropriately defined effective dimension, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(D_\mathrm{eff} \)</span>, decreases continuously from <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(D_\mathrm{eff}=D\)</span> (at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\ell \gg \ell _0\)</span>) to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(D_\mathrm{eff}=2\)</span> (at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(\ell \sim \ell _0\)</span>). This suggests that the physical spacetime becomes essentially 2-dimensional near Planck scale.
The phase shift induced by a uniform rotation in a Michelson interferometer is re-derived in the geometrical framework of the coordinate-free formalism of general relativity from the co-rotating point of view. The effect is second order in the ratio of the interferometer’s speed to the speed of light and further suppressed by the ratio of the length of the interferometer’s arms to the radius of rotation. The relation of the effect to gravitational time dilation is discussed.

Scalar–tensor (ST) gravity is considered in the case where the scalar is an external field. We show that general relativity (GR) and usual ST gravity are particular cases of the external scalar–tensor (EST) gravity. It is shown with a particular cosmological example that it is possible to join a part of a GR solution to a part of a ST one such that the complete solution neither belongs to GR nor to ST, but fully satisfies the EST field equations. We argue that external fields may effectively work as a type of screening mechanism for ST theories.
The spectroscopy of a weakly isolated horizon has been investigated. We obtain an equally spaced entropy spectrum with its quantum equal to the one given by Bekenstein (Phys Rev D 7:2333, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">1973</a></span>). We demonstrate that the quantization of entropy and area is a generic property of horizons which exists in a wide class of spacetimes admitting weakly isolated horizons. Our method based on the tunneling method also indicates that the entropy quantum of black hole horizons is closely related to Hawking temperature.
Differential operators for raising and lowering angular momentum for spherical harmonics are used widely in many branches of physics. Less well known are raising and lowering operators for both spin and the azimuthal component of angular momentum (Goldberg et al. in J Math Phys 8:2155, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1967</a></span>). In this paper we generalize the spin-raising and lowering operators of spin-weighted spherical harmonics to operators linear-in-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\gamma \)</span> for spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\gamma \)</span> is an additional parameter present in the second order ordinary differential equation governing these harmonics. Constructing these operators has required using all the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\ell \)</span>-, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em>- and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>-raising and lowering operators (and various combinations of them) for spin-weighted spherical harmonics, which have been calculated and shown explicitly in this paper. Following a well-defined procedure, the operators given could be generalized to higher powers in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\gamma \)</span>.
A model of a universe without big bang singularity is presented, which displays an early inflationary period ending just before a phase transition to a kination epoch. The model produces enough heavy particles so as to reheat the universe at temperatures in the MeV regime. After the reheating, it smoothly matches the standard <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM scenario.
The construction of stationary axisymmetric multiwormhole solutions to gravitating field theories admitting toroidal reductions to three-dimensional gravitating sigma models is reviewed. We show that, as in the multi-black hole case, strut singularities always appear in this construction, except for very special configurations with an odd number of centers. We also review the analytical continuation of the multicenter solution across the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> cuts associated with the wormhole mouths. The resulting Riemann manifold has <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2^n\)</span> sheets interconnected by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(2^{n-1}n\)</span> wormholes. We find that the maximally extended multicenter solution can never be asymptotically locally flat in all the Riemann sheets.
In this paper, we study shearing spherically symmetric homogeneous density fluids in comoving coordinates. It is found that the expansion of the four-velocity of a perfect fluid is homogeneous, whereas its shear is generated by an arbitrary function of time <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>), related to the mass function of the distribution. This function is found to bear a functional relationship with density. The field equations are reduced to two coupled first order ordinary differential equations for the metric coefficients <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(g_{11}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(g_{22}\)</span>. We have explored a class of solutions assuming that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> is a linear function of the density. This class embodies, as a subcase, the complete class of shear-free solutions. We have discussed the off quoted work of Kustaanheimo (Comment Phys Math XIII:12, 1, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24">1947</a></span>) and have noted that it deals with shear-free fluids having anisotropic pressure. It is shown that the anisotropy of the fluid is characterized by an arbitrary function of time. We have discussed some issues of historical priorities and credentials related to shear-free solutions. Recent controversial claims by Mitra (Astrophys Space Sci 333:351, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29">2011</a></span> and Gravit Cosmol 18:17, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR28">2012</a></span>) have also been addressed. We found that the singularity and the shearing motion of the fluid are closely related. Hence, there is a need for fresh look to the solutions obtained earlier in comoving coordinates.
We examine the stability of Einstein–Maxwell perfect fluid configurations with a privileged radial direction by means of a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+1+2\)</span>-tetrad formalism. We use this formalism to cast in a quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic form the equations describing the evolution of the system. This hyperbolic reduction is used to discuss the stability of linear perturbations in some special cases. By restricting the analysis to isotropic fluid configurations, we assume a constant electrical conductivity coefficient for the fluid. As a result of this analysis we provide a complete classification and characterization of various stable and unstable configurations. We find, in particular, that in many cases the stability conditions are strongly determined by the constitutive equations and the electric conductivity. A threshold for the emergence of the instability appears in both contracting and expanding systems.
The Beyond Einstein Advanced Coherent Optical Network (BEACON) mission was designed to achieve an accuracy of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(10^{-9}\)</span> in measuring the Eddington parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\gamma \)</span>, which is perhaps the most fundamental Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameter. However, this ideal accuracy was just estimated as a ratio of the measurement accuracy of the inter-spacecraft distances to the magnitude of the departure from Euclidean geometry. Based on the BEACON concept, we construct a measurement model to estimate the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\gamma \)</span> with the least squares method. Influences of the measurement noise and the out-of-plane error on the estimation accuracy are evaluated based on the white noise model. Though the BEACON mission does not require expensive drag-free systems and avoids physical dynamical models of spacecraft, the relatively low accuracy of initial inter-spacecraft distances poses a great challenge, which reduces the estimation accuracy in about two orders of magnitude. Thus the noise requirements may need to be more stringent in the design in order to achieve the target accuracy, which is demonstrated in the work. Considering that, we have given the limits on the power spectral density of both noise sources for the accuracy of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(10^{-9}\)</span>.
We study an inflationary model with a single complex scalar field in the framework of braneworld Randall–Sundrum model type 2. From the scalar curvature perturbation constrained by the recent observation values, and for specific choice of parameters, we can reduce the values of the coupling constant to take the natural values, and we found that the phase theta <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\theta \)</span> of the inflation field can take the narrow interval. We have also derived all known inflationary parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((n_{s},\)</span> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\frac{dn_{s}}{d\ln (k)})\)</span>, which are widely consistent with the recent Planck data for a suitable choice of brane tension value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\lambda \)</span>.
A self-consistent pre-inflationary extension of the inflationary scenario with the Starobinsky potential, favored by Planck data, is studied using techniques from loop quantum cosmology (LQC). The results are compared with the quadratic potential previously studied. Planck scale completion of the inflationary paradigm and observable signatures of LQC are found to be robust under the change of the inflation potential. The entire evolution, from the quantum bounce all the way to the end of inflation, is compatible with observations. Occurrence of desired slow-roll phase is almost inevitable and natural initial conditions exist for both the background and perturbations for which the resulting power spectrum agrees with recent observations. There exist initial data for which the quantum gravitational corrections to the power spectrum are potentially observable.
In this paper, under natural geometric and physical assumptions we provide new uniqueness and non-existence results for complete maximal hypersurfaces in spatially open Robertson–Walker spacetimes whose fiber is flat. Moreover, our results are applied to relevant spacetimes as the steady state spacetime, Einstein-de Sitter spacetime and radiation models.
Hawking radiation acts as a cosmic censor since it carries away the angular momentum of the black hole, proportionally more than its mass. In this work we first show that an extremal black hole cannot exist since it will be pushed away from extremality by its own Hawking radiation, without being perturbed by any external effect. We evaluate the efficiency of Hawking radiation to prevent overspinning of black holes. We make an order of magnitude estimate to show that evaporation can prevent overspinning of black holes with an upper limit of mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M\lesssim 10^{17}{-}10^{18}\)</span> g, when we take the interaction period to be the age of the universe. Overspinning of black holes of higher masses by test fields remains possible, even if evaporation is taken into account. We also discuss the possibility to attribute a shorter interaction period for the problem which would reduce the effect of evaporation.
We generalize the reflection theorem of the Lorentz–Minkowski plane to that of the Lorentz–Minkowski spaces of higher dimensions. As a result, we show that an isometry of the Lorentz–Minkowski spacetime is a composition of at most 5 reflections.
I analyze the possible relevance of LIGO’s gravitational wave detection to the viability of massive gravity models. In GR, a wave zone, where the linearized approximation holds, is guaranteed to exist and the observed wave’s amplitude profile can be sufficiently related to the emitting strong field interior to verify that, in this case, it was due to an inspiraling black hole merger. After an excursion to massive spin 1’s massless limit, linear massive tensor theory is shown explicitly to propagate only (retarded) maximal, helicity 2, modes to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>) as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(m\rightarrow 0\)</span>; however, we don’t know if the full theory has a similar “wave zone” governed by the linear model. Even if it does, a much more serious obstacle for massive gravity is to construct a time-varying strong field event to compare with the strong field footprint of LIGO’s observed signals.
We find the explicit form of two-point function for the conformal spin-2 energy momentum operators on the near horizon of a near extremal Kerr black hole by variation of a proper boundary action. In this regard, we consider an appropriate boundary action for the gravitational perturbation of the Kerr black hole. We show that the variation of the boundary action with respect to the boundary fields yields the two-point function for the energy momentum tensor of a conformal field theory. We find agreement between the two-point function and the correlators of the dual conformal field theory to the Kerr black hole.
The scattering of massive particles by a Schwarzschild black hole also undergoing a drag force is considered. The latter is modeled as a viscous force acting on the orbital plane, with components proportional to the associated particle 4-velocity components. The energy and angular momentum losses as well as the dependence of the hyperbolic scattering angle on the strength of the drag are investigated in situations where strong field effects cause large deflections.
In this paper we present a statistical description of the cosmological constant in terms of massless bosons (gravitons). To this purpose, we use our recent results implying a non vanishing temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({T_{\Lambda }}\)</span> for the cosmological constant. In particular, we found that a non vanishing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(T_{\Lambda }\)</span> allows us to depict the cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda \)</span> as composed of elementary oscillations of massless bosons of energy <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\hbar \omega \)</span> by means of the Bose–Einstein distribution. In this context, as happens for photons in a medium, the effective phase velocity <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(v_g\)</span> of these massless excitations is not given by the speed of light <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> but it is suppressed by a factor depending on the number of quanta present in the universe at the apparent horizon. We found interesting formulas relating the cosmological constant, the number of quanta <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> and the mean value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\overline{\lambda }\)</span> of the wavelength of the gravitons. In this context, we study the possibility to look to the gravitons system so obtained as being very near to be a Bose–Einstein condensate. Finally, an attempt is done to write down the Friedmann flat equations in terms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\overline{\lambda }\)</span>.
In this work we take a formal approach to the problem of decoupling Proca equations in curved space-times. We use Newman–Penrose two-spinor formalism to represent the Proca vector by one complex and two real scalars. We show that a decoupled second order differential equation for one of the real scalars can be derived if and only if the background space-time admits a covariantly constant null vector. Thus, the background space-time must be a pp-wave vacuum. We evaluate the separability of Proca, Maxwell and Dirac equations on the resulting pp-wave background.
It has been shown by explicit and exact calculation that whenever we have taken the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">effects of stable thermal fluctuations</em>, the entropy product formula should <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not be mass-independent</em> nor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">does it quantized</em>. It has been examined by giving some specific examples for non-rotating and rotating black hole.
Consistency conditions for nonminimally coupled <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories have been derived by requiring the absence of tachyons and instabilities in the scalar fluctuations. This note confirms these results and clarifies a subtlety regarding different definitions of sound speeds.
We construct a new class of rotating dilaton solutions in the presence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics. These solutions represent black branes with flat horizon and contain <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(k=[(n-1)/2]\)</span> rotation parameters in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional spacetime where [<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>] is the integer part of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>. We study the causal structure of the spacetime and calculate thermodynamic and conserved quantities and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics on the black brane horizon, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({ dM}={ TdS}+{{{\sum _{i=1}^{k}}}}\Omega _{i}d{J}_{i}+{ Ud}{Q}\)</span>. Then, we study geometrical approach towards thermodynamics by choosing an appropriate geometrical metric. We show that the singularity of the Ricci scalar coincides exactly with the phase transition points. We observe that our system encounters two types of phase transitions depending on the metric parameters. For the first one the heat capacity is zero and for the second one the heat capacity diverges. In the first kind of phase transition, the brane has a transition from an unstable non-physical to a stable physical state. In the second type of phase transition the brane moves from a stable to an unstable state. Finally, we comment on the dynamical stability of the obtained solutions under perturbations in four dimensions.
The era of gravitational-wave astronomy began on 14 September 2015, when the LIGO Scientific Collaboration detected the merger of two <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\sim }30~M_\odot \)</span> black holes at a distance of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\sim }400\)</span> Mpc. This event has facilitated qualitatively new tests of gravitational theories, and has also produced exciting information about the astrophysical origin of black hole binaries. In this review we discuss the implications of this event for gravitational physics and astrophysics, as well as the expectations for future detections. In brief: (1) because the spins of the black holes could not be measured accurately and because mergers are not well calculated for modified theories of gravity, the current analysis of GW150914 does not place strong constraints on gravity variants that change only the generation of gravitational waves, but (2) it does strongly constrain alterations of the propagation of gravitational waves and alternatives to black holes. Finally, (3) many astrophysical models for the origin of heavy black hole binaries such as the GW150914 system are in play, but a reasonably robust conclusion that was reached even prior to the detection is that the environment of such systems needs to have a relatively low abundance of elements heavier than helium.
Constructing a well-posed variational principle is a non-trivial issue in general relativity. For spacelike and timelike boundaries, one knows that the addition of the Gibbons–Hawking–York (GHY) counter-term will make the variational principle well-defined. This result, however, does not directly generalize to null boundaries on which the 3-metric becomes degenerate. In this work, we address the following question: What is the counter-term that may be added on a null boundary to make the variational principle well-defined? We propose the boundary integral of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2 \sqrt{-g} \left( \Theta +\kappa \right) \)</span> as an appropriate counter-term for a null boundary. We also conduct a preliminary analysis of the variations of the metric on the null boundary and conclude that isolating the degrees of freedom that may be fixed for a well-posed variational principle requires a deeper investigation.
The Buchdahl limit for static spherically symmetric isotropic stars is generalised to the case of five dimensional Gauss–Bonnet gravity. Our result depends on the sign of the Gauss–Bonnet coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\alpha \)</span>. When <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha &gt;0\)</span>, we find, unlike in general relativity, that the bound is dependent on the stellar structure, in particular the central energy density and we find that stable stellar structures can exist arbitrarily close to the black hole horizon. Thus stable stars can exist with extra mass in this theory compared to five dimensional general relativity. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha &lt;0\)</span> it is found that the Buchdahl bound is more restrictive than the general relativistic case.
In this paper, we study the dynamical instability of gaseous sphere under radial oscillations approaching the Reissner–Nordström limit. For this purpose, we derive linearized perturbed equation of motion following the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. We formulate perturbed pressure in terms of adiabatic index by employing the conservation of baryon numbers. A variational principle is established to evaluate characteristic frequencies of oscillations which lead to the criteria for dynamical stability. The dynamical instability of homogeneous sphere as well as relativistic polytropes with different values of charge in Newtonian and post-Newtonian regimes is explored. We also find their radii of instability in terms of the Reissner–Nordstörm radius. We conclude that dynamical instability occurs if the gaseous sphere contracts to the Reissner–Nordstörm radius for different values of charge.
The external matter stress-tensor supporting charged Vaidya solution appears to violate weak energy condition in certain region of the spacetime. Motivated by this, a new interpretation of charged Vaidya solution was proposed by Ori (Class Quant Grav 8:1559, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1991</a></span>) in which the energy condition continues to be satisfied. In this construction, one glues an outgoing Vaidya solution to the original ingoing Vaidya solution provided the surface where the external stress-tensor vanishes is spacelike. We revisit this study and extend it to higher-dimensions, to AdS settings, and to higher-derivative <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories. In asymptotically flat space context, we explore in detail the case when the mass function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>) is proportional to the charge function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em>). When the proportionality constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\nu = q(v)/m(v)\)</span> lies in between zero and one, we show that the surface where the external stress-tensor vanishes is spacelike and lies in between the inner and outer apparent horizons.
The perihelion precession, the deflection of light and the radar echo delay are classical tests of General Relativity here used to probe brane-world topologically charged black holes in a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) bulk. Moreover, such tests are used to constrain the parameter that arises from the Shiromizu–Maeda–Sasaki procedure applied to a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(R) bulk. Observational data constrain the possible values of the tidal charge parameter and the effective cosmological constant in this context. We show that the observational/experimental data for both perihelion precession and radar echo delay make the black hole parameters to be more strict than the ones for the DMPR black hole. Moreover, the deflection of light constrains the tidal charge parameter similarly as the DMPR black holes, due to a peculiarity in the equation of motion.
We investigate black holes in a class of dRGT massive gravity for their quasi normal modes (QNMs) for neutral and charged ones using Improved Asymptotic Iteration Method and their thermodynamic behavior. The QNMs are studied for different values of the massive parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(m_g\)</span> for both neutral and charged dRGT black holes under a massless scalar perturbation. As <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(m_g\)</span> increases, the magnitude of the quasi normal frequencies are found to be increasing. The results are also compared with the Schwarzchild de Sitter case. P-V criticallity of the aforesaid black hoels under massles scalar perturbation in the de Sitter space are also studied in this paper. It is found that the thermodynamic behavior of a neutral black hole shows no physically feasible phase transition while a charged black hole shows a definite phase transition.
We obtain the analytic solutions of the radial part of the massless Klein–Gordon equation in the spacetime of both three dimensional rotating and four dimensional canonical acoustic black holes, which are given in terms of the confluent Heun functions. From these solutions, we obtain the scalar waves near the acoustic horizon. We discuss the analogue Hawking radiation of massless scalar particles and the features of the spectrum associated with the radiation emitted by these acoustic black holes.
We analyze the general model of a radiating star in general relativity. A group analysis of the under determined, nonlinear partial differential equation governing the model’s gravitational potentials is performed. This analysis is an extension of previous group analyses carried out and produces new group invariant solutions. We find that the gravitational potentials depend on exponential functions owing to the choice of the Lie symmetry generator. The fundamental boundary equation to be solved is in general a Riccati equation. Several new exact families of solutions to the boundary condition are generated. Earlier models of Euclidean stars and generalized Euclidean stellar models are regained as special cases. Linear equations of state can be found for shear-free and shearing spacetimes.
The Hamiltonian constraint <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(H_c = N{\mathcal {H}} = 0\)</span>, defines a diffeomorphic structure on spatial manifolds by the lapse function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> in general theory of relativity. However, it is not manifest in Lanczos–Lovelock gravity, since the expression for velocity in terms of the momentum is multivalued. Thus the Hamiltonian is a branch function of momentum. Here we propose an extended theory of Lanczos–Lovelock gravity to construct a unique Hamiltonian in its minisuperspace version, which results in manifest diffeomorphic invariance and canonical quantization.
We assume the spacetime foam picture in which vacuum is filled with virtual wormholes. In the presence of an external field the distribution of wormholes changes. We consider an anisotropic distribution of wormholes and analyze its relation to the speed of light. We show that speed of light acquires an anisotropic character and save the normal dispersion a gas of virtual wormholes may possess also an anomalous dispersion, i.e., when the light velocity exceeds that in the vacuum.
We present <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">area (or entropy) functional relation</em> for multi-horizons five dimensional (5D) Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet–AdS black hole. It has been observed by exact and explicit calculation that some complicated function of two or three horizons area is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mass-independent</em> whereas the entropy product relation is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> mass-independent. We also study the local thermodynamic stability of this black hole. The phase transition occurs at certain condition. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Smarr mass formula</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">first law</em> of thermodynamics have been derived. This <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mass-independent</em> relation suggests they could turn out to be an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">universal</em> quantity and further helps us to understanding the nature of black hole entropy (both interior and exterior) at the microscopic level. In the “Appendix”, we have derived the thermodynamic products for 5D Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet black hole with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">vanishing</em> cosmological constant.
It is shown in this paper that the symplectic form for the system consisting of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional bulk Palatini gravity and SO(1, 1) BF theory on an isolated horizon as a boundary just contains the bulk term. An alternative quantization procedure for the boundary BF theory is presented. The area entropy is determined by the degree of freedom of the bulk spin network states which satisfy a suitable boundary condition. The gauge-fixing condition in the approach and the advantages of the approach are also discussed.
Recently, a general method for calculating conserved charges for (black hole) solutions to generally covariant gravitational theories, in any dimensions and with arbitrary asymptotic behaviors has been introduced. Equipped with this method, which can be dubbed as “solution phase space method,” we calculate mass and angular momentum for the Kerr–dS black holes. Furthermore, for any choice of horizons, associated entropy and the first law of thermodynamics are derived. Interestingly, according to insensitivity of the analysis to the chosen cosmological constant, the analysis unifies the thermodynamics of rotating stationary black holes in 4 (and other) dimensions with either AdS, flat or dS asymptotics. We extend the analysis to include electric charge, i.e. to the Kerr–Newman–dS black holes.
In the context of the coarse-graining of loop quantum gravity, we introduce loopy and tagged spin networks, which generalize the standard spin network states to account explicitly for non-trivial curvature and torsion. Both structures relax the closure constraints imposed at the spin network vertices. While tagged spin networks merely carry an extra spin at every vertex encoding the overall closure defect, loopy spin networks allow for an arbitrary number of loops attached to each vertex. These little loops can be interpreted as local excitations of the quantum gravitational field and we discuss the statistics to endow them with. The resulting Fock space of loopy spin networks realizes new truncation of loop quantum gravity, allowing to formulate its graph-changing dynamics on a fixed background graph plus local degrees of freedom attached to the graph nodes. This provides a framework for re-introducing a non-trivial background quantum geometry around which we would study the effective dynamics of perturbations. We study how to implement the dynamics of topological BF theory in this framework. We realize the projection on flat connections through holonomy constraints and we pay special attention to their often overlooked non-trivial flat solutions defined by higher derivatives of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\delta \)</span>-distribution.
We inquire into the question of whether the quadratic spinor Lagrangian (QSL) formulation can describe the angular momentum for a general-relativistic system. The QSL Hamiltonian has previously been shown to be able to yield an energy–momentum quasilocalization which brings a proof of the positive gravitational energy when the spinor satisfies the conformal Witten equation. After inspection, we find that, under the constraint that the spinor on the asymptotic boundary is a constant, the QSL Hamiltonian is successful in giving an angular momentum quasilocalization. We also make certain the spinor in the Hamiltonian plays the role of a gauge field, a warrant of our permission to impose constraints on the spinor. Then, by some adjustment of the QSL Hamiltonian, we gain a covariant center-of-mass moment quasilocalization only under the condition that the displacement on the asymptotic boundary is a Killing boost vector. We expect the spinor expression will bring a proof of some connection between the gravitational energy and angular momentum.

For a large class of scalar-tensor-like gravity whose action contains nonminimal couplings between a scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\phi (x^\alpha )\)</span> and generic curvature invariants <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\left\{ {\mathcal {R}}\right\} \)</span> beyond the Ricci scalar <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(R=R^\alpha _{\;\;\alpha }\)</span>, we prove the covariant invariance of its field equation and confirm/prove the local energy-momentum conservation. These <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\phi (x^\alpha )-{\mathcal {R}}\)</span> coupling terms break the symmetry of diffeomorphism invariance under an active transformation, which implies that the solutions to the field equation should satisfy the consistency condition <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\mathcal {R}}\equiv 0\)</span> when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\phi (x^\alpha )\)</span> is nondynamical and massless. Following this fact and based on the accelerated expansion of the observable Universe, we propose a primary test to check the viability of the modified gravity to be an effective dark energy, and a simplest example passing the test is the “Weyl/conformal dark energy”.
We consider a massless quantum scalar field on a two-dimensional space–time describing a thin shell of matter collapsing to form a Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole. At early times, before the shell starts to collapse, the quantum field is in the vacuum state, corresponding to the Boulware vacuum on an eternal black hole space–time. The scalar field satisfies reflecting boundary conditions on the anti-de Sitter boundary. Using the Davies–Fulling–Unruh prescription for computing the renormalized expectation value of the stress–energy tensor, we find that at late times the black hole is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at the Hawking temperature, so the quantum field is in a state analogous to the Hartle–Hawking vacuum on an eternal black hole space–time.
We explore ways to obtain <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the very existence</em> of a space–time metric from an action principle that does not refer to it a priori. Although there are reasons to believe that only a non-local theory can viably achieve this goal, we investigate here local theories that start with Schrödinger’s purely affine theory (Schrödinger in Space-time structure. Cambridge UP, Cambridge, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21">1950</a></span>), where he gave reasons to set the metric proportional to the Ricci curvature aposteriori. When we leave the context of unified field theory, and we couple the non-gravitational matter using some weak equivalence principle, we can show that the propagation of shock waves does not define a lightcone when the purely affine theory is local and avoids the explicit use of the Ricci tensor in realizing the weak equivalence principle. When the Ricci tensor is substituted for the metric, the equations seem to have only a very limited set of solutions. This backs the conviction that viable purely affine theories have to be non-local.
In this paper we investigate the influence of a continuous particles creation processes on the linear and nonlinear matter clustering, and its consequences on the weak lensing effect induced by structure formation. We study the line of sight behavior of the contribution to the bispectrum signal at a given angular multipole <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>, showing that the scale where the nonlinear growth overcomes the linear effect depends strongly of particles creation rate.
In this paper the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole, which is presented as a vacuum, homogeneous and anisotropic Kantowski–Sachs minisuperspace cosmological model, is considered. Lagrangian of the model is reduced by a suitable coordinate transformation to Lagrangian of two decoupled oscillators with the same frequencies and with zero energy in total (an oscillator-ghost-oscillator system). The model is presented in a classical, a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">p</em>-adic and a noncommutative case. Then, within the standard quantum approach Wheeler–DeWitt equation and its general solutions, i.e. a wave function of the model is written, and then an adelic wave function is constructed. Finally, thermodynamics of the model is studied by using the Feynman–Hibbs procedure.
We study Hawking radiation of Dirac particles with spin-1 / 2 as a tunneling process from Schwarzschild–de Sitter and Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter black holes in background spacetimes with a spinning cosmic string and a global monopole. Solving Dirac’s equation by employing the Hamilton–Jacobi method and WKB approximation we find the corresponding tunneling probabilities and the Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we show that the Hawking temperature of those black holes remains unchanged in presence of topological defects in both cases.
We study the internal solution, and external vacuum solution for radial cutoff, of “van Stockum dust”, an infinitely long rotating pressureless dust column; its density increases with radius. This interesting but poorly explored spacetime turns out to have a number of exotic properties, especially in the external vacuum region. These solutions have been known for decades, but it seems that they have never been investigated in detail. In this paper we analyze them and describe their peculiar properties. There are three regimes of radial cutoff that are of interest: (1) If the dust column is thick enough that closed timelike loops (CTLs or “time machines”) exist inside the column, then the radius of the entire “universe” is finite, and in fact does not extend much beyond the edge of the matter, even though the metric’s radial parameter is unbounded. This interesting finite proper radius seems to have been missed by earlier investigators. Other exotic properties of the external vacuum in this regime: CTLs exist in cylindrical shells, alternating with shells having no circular CTLs; there are infinitely many such shells, getting closer and closer together as one gets farther from the rotation axis. Also, a separate set of infinitely many cylindrical shells exists, having what might be termed “extreme frame-dragging”, within which motion is possible only in one direction; they alternate with “normal” shells allowing motion in either direction. Gravitational attraction and tides <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">increase</em> with distance from the matter column, and diverge at the “edge of the universe”. In addition, though the radius of the universe is finite, its circumference is infinite; and its boundary is a circle, not a cylinder (the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>-axis has shrunk to nothing at the edge). (2) For smaller radial cutoff, but still large enough to produce CTLs, the radius of the universe is infinite; but there are still infinitely many cylindrical shells of CTLs alternating with non-CTL shells. However, the innermost shell begins substantially <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">outside</em> the dust, making this solution even stranger—you have to back away from the matter to find a CTL! And, regardless of how far away you are, there are still infinitely many CTL shells beyond you, the closest only a finite distance away. (3) For radial cutoff too close to produce CTLs, the external solution is more benign; nearby it perhaps approximates that of a finite rotating rod. But “planes” of constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em> approach each other at large radii, so that any two enclose a shape somewhat like two pie-pans facing each other and glued together at their edges.
In this paper, we prove that there are no multiple black holes in an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional static vacuum space-time having weakly harmonic curvature unless the Ricci curvature is trivial.
In this paper the quantum backreaction of non-minimally coupled massless quintom fields in FLRW universe has been discussed. quintom model contains two massless scalar fields where one of scalar fields has positive kinetic energy and another one has negative kinetic energy term. In this model, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the full energy–momentum tensor in different cosmological eras including inflation, radiation and matter dominated eras on FRLW universe with constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\epsilon \)</span>. This quantity is divergent in different cases. In order to renormalize it, we separate the vacuum expectation values of the full energy–momentum tensor to the UV and IR parts by using <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mu \)</span> cutoff. Then we eliminate the UV divergences by introducing a counterterm action and adding it to the action of the model. Also we calculate the IR part of the energy–momentum tensor during inflation and different transitions. For this purpose, we assume that the transition from one period to the next happens fast. Therefore we use a sudden transition approximation at matching time. In order to study behavior of the backreaction, we obtain the ratio of the dominant contribution of quantum energy density to the corresponding background quantity in different cosmological eras. Moreover, we show that the one-loop fluctuations of quintom model on de Sitter space give a contribution to the cosmological constant. Finally we obtain the effect of the quantum backreaction on the background geometry leading to new scale factor for cosmological eras.
The quasi-Newtonian limit for arbitrary gravitational theories of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) class is considered. It is shown that only a subclass of these theories have such a limit. The approximate field equation and equations of motion are calculated and discussed. Moreover, the general solutions of the approximate field equation is investigated where especially solutions for point particles are focused. We found that the approximate field equation is in general of fourth-order with a source term which depends not only on the mass density but also on its Laplaceian.
In this work we consider gravitational theories in which the effect of coupling characteristic classes, appropriately introduced as operators in the Einstein-Hilbert action, has been taken into account. As it is well known, this approach strays from the framework of general relativity since it results in theories in which torsion can be present. We consider here all the characteristic classes that are consistent with a four-dimensional space-time manifold. Then, we present explicit expressions for the contortion 1-form and torsion 2-form for a broad class of conditions in various cases of interest. Additionally, we use the same framework to study cosmological scenarios that are obtained mainly by selecting the flat FLRW metric and an ideal fluid.
We consider <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f\left( {R,T} \right) \)</span> modified theory of gravity in which, in general, the gravitational Lagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. We indicate that in this type of the theory, the coupling energy–momentum tensor is not conserved. However, we mainly focus on a particular model that matter is minimally coupled to the geometry in the metric formalism and wherein, its coupling energy–momentum tensor is also conserved. We obtain the corresponding Raychaudhuri dynamical equation that presents the evolution of the kinematic quantities. Then for the chosen model, we derive the behavior of the deceleration parameter, and show that the coupling term can lead to an acceleration phase after the matter dominated phase. On the other hand, the curvature of the universe corresponds with the deviation from parallelism in the geodesic motion. Thus, we also scrutinize the motion of the free test particles on their geodesics, and derive the geodesic deviation equation in this modified theory to study the accelerating universe within the spatially flat FLRW background. Actually, this equation gives the relative accelerations of adjacent particles as a measurable physical quantity, and provides an elegant tool to investigate the timelike and the null structures of spacetime geometries. Then, through the null deviation vector, we find the observer area–distance as a function of the redshift for the chosen model, and compare the results with the corresponding results obtained in the literature.
We present an algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), that estimates the mass ratio in a binary black hole collision out of given gravitational wave (GW) strains. In this analysis, the ANN is trained with a sample of GW signals generated with numerical simulations. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated with GWs generated also with simulations for given mass ratios unknown to the ANN. We measure the accuracy of the algorithm in the interpolation and extrapolation regimes. We present the results for noise free signals and signals contaminated with Gaussian noise, in order to foresee the dependence of the method accuracy in terms of the signal to noise ratio.
We consider the fact that noticing on the operational meaning of the physical concepts played an impetus role in the appearance of general relativity (GR). Thus, we have paid more attention to the operational definition of the gravitational coupling constant in this theory as a dimensional constant which is gained through an experiment. However, as all available experiments just provide the value of this constant locally, this coupling constant can operationally be meaningful only in a local area. Regarding this point, to obtain an extension of GR for the large scale, we replace it by a conformal invariant model and then, reduce this model to a theory for the cosmological scale via breaking down the conformal symmetry through singling out a specific conformal frame which is characterized by the large scale characteristics of the universe. Finally, we come to the same field equations that historically were proposed by Einstein for the cosmological scale (GR plus the cosmological constant) as the result of his endeavor for making GR consistent with the Mach principle. However, we declare that the obtained field equations in this alternative approach do not carry the problem of the field equations proposed by Einstein for being consistent with Mach’s principle (i.e., the existence of de Sitter solution), and can also be considered compatible with this principle in the Sciama view.
Spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Shape Dynamics were previously studied assuming standard falloff conditions for the metric and the momenta. These ensure that the spacetime is asymptotically Minkowski, and that the falloff conditions are Poincaré-invariant. These requirements however are not legitimate in Shape Dynamics, which does not make assumptions on the structure or regularity of spacetime. Analyzing the same problem in full generality, I find that the system is underdetermined, as there is one function of time that is not fixed by any condition and appears to have physical relevance. This quantity can be fixed only by studying more realistic models coupled with matter, and it turns out to be related to the dilatational momentum of the matter surrounding the region under study.
We compare observational data of growth rate with the prediction by Galileon theory. For the same value of the energy density parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varOmega _{m,0}\)</span>, the growth rate in Galileon models is enhanced compared with the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varLambda \)</span>CDM case, due to the enhancement of Newton’s constant. The smaller <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varOmega _{m,0}\)</span> is, the more suppressed growth rate is. Hence the best fit value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\varOmega _{m,0}\)</span> in the Galileon model is 0.16 from only the growth rate data, which is considerably smaller than such value obtained from observations of supernovae Ia, the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. We also find the upper limit of the Brans–Dicke parameter to be <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\omega &lt; -\)</span>1000 (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(1\sigma \)</span>), from the growth rate data. In this paper, specific galileon models are considered, not the entire class. More and better growth rate data are required to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity.
The curvaton reheating mechanism in a non-minimal derivative coupling to gravity for any non-oscillating (NO) model is studied. In this framework, we analyze the energy density during the kinetic epoch and we find that this energy has a complicated dependencies of the scale factor. Considering this mechanism, we study the decay of the curvaton in two different scenarios and also we determine the reheating temperatures. As an example the NO model, we consider an exponential potential and we obtain the reheating temperature indirectly from the inflation through of the number of e-folds.
We use the 1<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(+\)</span>1<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(+\)</span>2 covariant approach to clarify a number of aspects of spherically symmetric solutions of non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theories. Particular attention is focused on the extension of Birkhoff’s theorem and the nature of quasi-local horizons in this context.
The structure of an interior dipole magnetic field of neutron stars in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity is considered. For this purpose, the perturbative approaches are used when both the deviations from general relativity and the deformations of spherically symmetric configurations associated with the presence of the magnetic field are assumed to be small. Solutions are constructed which describe relativistic, spherically symmetric configurations consisting of a gravitating magnetized perfect fluid modeled by a realistic equation of state. Comparing configurations from general relativity and modified gravity, we reveal possible differences in the structure of the magnetic field which occur in considering neutron stars in modified gravity.
We examine charged slowly rotating perfect fluids in the presence of a cosmological constant. The asymptotic form of the vacuum solutions to the linearised Einstein–Maxwell field equations is found and the possibility of matching this vacuum to the slow rotating García metric is considered. We show that, contrary to the case of zero cosmological constant, this García metric can be matched to an asymptotically de Sitter vacuum in the slow rotation limit. We conclude the García metric may potentially be suitable for describing a charged isolated rotating body in a cosmological background.
We investigate the existence of black hole and soliton solutions to four dimensional, anti-de Sitter (adS), Einstein–Yang–Mills theories with general semisimple connected and simply connected gauge groups, concentrating on the so-called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">regular</em> case. We here generalise results for the asymptotically flat case, and compare our system with similar results from the well-researched adS <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathfrak {su}}(N)\)</span> system. We find the analysis differs from the asymptotically flat case in some important ways: the biggest difference is that for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span>, solutions are much less constrained as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(r\rightarrow \infty \)</span>, making it possible to prove the existence of global solutions to the field equations in some neighbourhood of existing trivial solutions, and in the limit of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(|\Lambda |\rightarrow \infty \)</span>. In particular, we can identify non-trivial solutions where the gauge field functions have no zeroes, which in the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({\mathfrak {su}}(N)\)</span> case proved important to stability.
We consider equatorial motion of particles in the ergoregion of generic axially symmetric rotating black holes. We introduce the notion of zero energy observers (ZEOs) as counterparts to known zero angular observers (ZAMOs). It is shown that the trajectory of a ZEO has precisely one turning point that lies on the boundary of the ergoregion for photons and inside the ergoregion for massive particles. As a consequence, such trajectories enter the ergosphere from the white hole region under horizon and leave it crossing the horizon again (entering the black hole region). The angular velocity of ZEO does not depend on the angular momentum. For particles with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(E&gt;0\)</span> this velocity is bigger than for a ZEO, for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(E&lt;0\)</span> it is smaller. General limitations on the angular momentum are found depending on whether the trajectory lies entirely inside the ergoregion, bounces back from the boundary or intersects it. These results generalize the recent observations made in A. A. Grib, Yu. V. Pavlov, <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02592"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1601.02592</span></a></span> for the Kerr metric. We also show that collision between a ZEO and a particle with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(E\ne 0\)</span> near a black hole can lead to the unbound energy in the centre of mass thus giving a special version of the Bañados-Silk-West effect.
We find a new method for looking for the static and spherically symmetric solutions in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory of gravity. With this method, a number of new solutions in terms of the analytic functions are obtained. We hope this investigation may be of some help in the searching for some other solutions in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory of gravity.
A new exact vacuum solution in five dimensions, which describes a magnetized cylindrical wormhole in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(3+1\)</span> dimensions is presented. The magnetic field lines are stretched along the wormhole throat and are concentrated near to it. We study the motion of neutral and charged test particles under the influence of the magnetized wormhole. The effective potential for a neutral test particle around and across the magnetized wormhole has a repulsive character. The gravitational lensing for the magnetized wormhole for various lens parameters are calculated and compared. The total magnetic flux on either side of the wormhole is obtained. We present analytic expressions which show regions in which the null energy condition is violated.
We examine the effects of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity on Jeans analysis of collapsing dust clouds. We provide a method for testing modified gravity models by their effects on star formation as the presence of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f(R)</em> gravity is found to modify the limit for collapse. In this analysis we add perturbations to a de Sitter background. As the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is modified, new types of dynamics emerge. Depending on the characteristics of a chosen <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) model, the appearance of new limits is possible. The physicality of these limits is further examined. We find the asymptotic Jeans masses for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories compared to standard Jeans mass. Through this ratio, the effects of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) modified Jeans mass for viable theories are examined in molecular clouds. Bok globules have a mass range comparable to Jeans masses in question and are therefore used for comparing different <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models. Viable theories are found to assist in star formation.
We discuss various properties of rotating Killing horizons in generic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories of gravity in dimension four for spacetimes endowed with two commuting Killing vector fields. Assuming there is no curvature singularity anywhere on or outside the horizon, we construct a suitable <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((3+1)\)</span>-foliation. We show that similar to Einstein’s gravity, we must have <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(T_{ab}k^ak^b=0\)</span> on the Killing horizon, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(k^a\)</span> is a null geodesic tangent to the horizon. For axisymmetric spacetimes, the effective gravitational coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\sim \,F'^{-1}(R)\)</span> should usually depend upon the polar coordinate and hence need not necessarily be a constant on the Killing horizon. We prove that the surface gravity of such a Killing horizon must be a constant, irrespective of whether <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(F'(R)\)</span> is a constant there or not. We next apply these results to investigate some further basic features. In particular, we show that any hairy solution for the real massive vector field in such theories is clearly ruled out, as long as the potential of the scalar field generated in the corresponding Einstein’s frame is a positive definite quantity.
An affine transport equation was used recently to study properties of angular momentum and gravitational-wave memory effects in general relativity. In this paper, we investigate local properties of this transport equation in greater detail. Associated with this transport equation is a map between the tangent spaces at two points on a curve. This map consists of a homogeneous (linear) part given by the parallel transport map along the curve plus an inhomogeneous part, which is related to the development of a curve in a manifold into an affine tangent space. For closed curves, the affine transport equation defines a “generalized holonomy” that takes the form of an affine map on the tangent space. We explore the local properties of this generalized holonomy by using covariant bitensor methods to compute the generalized holonomy around geodesic polygon loops. We focus on triangles and “parallelogramoids” with sides formed from geodesic segments. For small loops, we recover the well-known result for the leading-order linear holonomy (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sim \)</span> Riemann <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\times \)</span> area), and we derive the leading-order inhomogeneous part of the generalized holonomy (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\sim \)</span> Riemann <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\times \)</span> area<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(^{3/2}\)</span>). Our bitensor methods let us naturally compute higher-order corrections to these leading results. These corrections reveal the form of the finite-size effects that enter into the holonomy for larger loops; they could also provide quantitative errors on the leading-order results for finite loops.
A new family of conserved currents for vacuum space-times with a Killing vector is presented. The currents are constructed from the superenergy tensor of the Mars-Simon tensor and using the positivity properties of the former we find that the conserved charges associated to the currents have natural positivity properties in certain cases. Given the role played by the Mars-Simon tensor in local and semi-local characterisations of the Kerr solution, the currents presented in this work are useful to construct non-negative scalar quantities characterising Kerr initial data (known in the literature as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-Kerrness</em>) which in addition are <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">conserved charges</em>.
We consider the thawing model in the framework of coupled quintessence model. The effective potential has <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(Z_2\)</span> symmetry which is broken spontaneously when the dark matter density becomes less than a critical value leading the quintessence equation of state parameter to deviate from <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(-1\)</span>. Conditions required for this procedure are obtained and analytical solution for the equation of state parameter is derived.
Considering the growing interest of the astrophysicist community in the study of dissipative fluids with the aim of getting a more realistic description of the universe, we present in this paper a physical analysis of the energy-momentum tensor of a viscous fluid with heat flux. We introduce the general form of this tensor and, using the approximation of small velocity gradients, we relate the stresses of the fluid with the viscosity coefficients, the shear tensor and the expansion factor. Exploiting these relations, we can write the stresses in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the normal surface to the 4-velocity vector of the fluid, and we can also establish a connection between the perfect fluid and the symmetries of the spacetime. On the other hand, we calculate the energy conditions for a dissipative fluid through contractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the 4-velocity vector of an arbitrary observer. This method is interesting because it allows us to compute the conditions in a reasonably easy way and without considering any approximation or restriction on the energy-momentum tensor.
Unimodular gravity (UG) is a restricted version of general relativity (GR) in which the variation of the metric determinant is set to zero and the field equations are given by the trace-free part of the full Einstein equations. The background equations in UG and GR are identical. It was recently claimed that the first order contribution in the temperature fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in UG is different from GR. In this work, we calculate the first order perturbation equations in UG and show that the Sachs–Wolfe effect in UG, in terms of gauge invariant variables, is identical to GR. We also show that the second order perturbation equation of Mukhanov–Sasaki variable in UG, is identical to GR. The only difference comes from the gauge choices due the constraint on the metric determinant. Hence, UG and GR are identical and indistinguishable in CMB data on large scales.
InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(3+1\)</span> formulations of the Einstein field equations have become an invaluable tool in Numerical relativity, having been used successfully in modeling spacetimes of black hole collisions, stellar collapse and other complex systems. It is plausible that similar considerations could prove fruitful for modified gravity theories. In this article, we pursue from a numerical relativistic viewpoint the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(3+1\)</span> formulation of metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity as it arises from the fourth order equations of motion, without invoking the dynamical equivalence with Brans-Dicke theories. We present the resulting system of evolution and constraint equations for a generic function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>), subject to the usual viability conditions. We confirm that the time propagation of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints take the same Mathematical form as in general relativity, irrespective of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) model. We further recast the 3+1 system in a form akin to the BSSNOK formulation of numerical relativity. Without assuming any specific model, we show that the ADM version of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) is weakly hyperbolic and is plagued by similar zero speed modes as in the general relativity case. On the other hand the BSSNOK version is strongly hyperbolic and hence a promising formulation for numerical simulations in metric <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories.
We consider a scenario in which the global geometry of the universe is driven by non-linear fermions obeying Heisenberg dynamics.
To explain the accelerated expansion of our universe, many dark energy models and modified gravity theories have been proposed so far. It is argued in the literature that they are difficult to be distinguished on the cosmological scales. Therefore, it is well motivated to consider the relevant astrophysical phenomena on (or below) the galactic scales. In this work, we study the stability of self-gravitating differentially rotating galactic disks in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) theory, and obtain the local stability criteria in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) theory, which are valid for all <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) theories satisfying <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(T=0)=0\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f_T (T=0)\not =0\)</span>, if the adiabatic approximation and the weak field limit are considered. The information of the function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) is mainly encoded in the parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \equiv 1/f_T(T=0)\)</span>. We find that the local stability criteria in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) theory are quite different from the ones in Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and other modified gravity theories such as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory. We consider that this might be a possible hint to distinguish <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) theory from general relativity and other modified gravity theories on (or below) the galactic scales.
We construct the solution corresponding to a rotating black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings (Rotating Letelier spacetime) from its nonrotating counterpart (Letelier spacetime) by applying a method of coordinate complexification developed by Newman and Janis.
We discuss non-static conformally symmetric traversable wormholes for spherically symmetric spacetime using the model <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(G)=\alpha G^{n}\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span> is an arbitrary constant. We investigate wormhole solutions by taking two types of shape function and found that physically realistic wormholes exist only for even values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. We also check the validity of flare-out condition, required for wormhole construction, for the shape functions deduced from two types of equation of state. It is found that this condition is satisfied by these functions in all cases except phantom case with non-static conformal symmetry.
A mysterious type of matter is supposed to exist because the observed rotational velocity curves of particles moving around the galactic center and the expected rotational velocity curves do not match. This type of matter is called dark matter. There are also a number of proposals in the modified gravity which are alternatives to the dark matter. In this contrast, in 2008, Christian G. Böhmer, Tiberiu Harko and Francisco S.N. Lobo presented an interesting idea in Böhmer et al. (Astropart Phys 29(6):386–392, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2008</a></span>) where they showed that a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\( f (\mathcal {R})\)</span> gravity model could actually explain dark matter to be a geometric effect only. They solved the gravitational field equations in vacuum using generic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\( f (\mathcal {R})\)</span> gravity model for constant velocity regions (i.e. dark matter regions around the galaxy). They found that the resulting modifications in the Einstein Hilbert Lagrangian is of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\mathcal {R}^{1+m}\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(m=V_{tg}^2/c^2\)</span>; <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(V_{tg}\)</span> being the tangential velocity of the test particle moving around the galaxy in the dark matter regions and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> being the speed of light. From observations it is known that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(m\approx \mathcal {O}(10^{-6})\)</span> (Böhmer et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2008</a></span>; Salucci et al. in Mon Not R Astron Soc 378(1):41–47, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2007</a></span>; Persic et al. in Mon Not R Astron Soc 281:27–47, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">1996</a></span>; Borriello and Salucci in Mon Not R Astron Soc 323(2):285–292, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">2001</a></span>). In this article, we perform two things (1) We show that the form of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\( f (\mathcal {R})\)</span> they claimed is not correct. In doing the calculations, we found that when the radial component of the metric for constant velocity regions is a constant then the exact solutions for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\( f (\mathcal {R})\)</span> obtained is of the form of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(\mathcal {R}^{1-\alpha }\)</span> which corresponds to a negative correction rather than positive claimed by the authors of Böhmer et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2008</a></span>), where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(\alpha \)</span> is the function of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>. (2) We also show that we can not have an analytic solution of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq14">\(f(\mathcal {R})\)</span> for all values of tangential velocity including the observed value of tangential velocity 200–300 km/s (Salucci et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2007</a></span>; Persic et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">1996</a></span>; Borriello and Salucci <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">2001</a></span>) if the radial coefficient of the metric which describes the dark matter regions is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not a constant</em>. Thus, we have to rely on the numerical solutions to get an approximate model for dark matter in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq15">\( f (\mathcal {R})\)</span> gravity.
The Newman–Janis Ansatz was used first to obtain the stationary Kerr metric from the static Schwarzschild metric. Many works have been devoted to investigate the physical significance of this Ansatz, but no definite answer has been given so far. We show that this Ansatz can be applied in general to conformastatic vacuum metrics, and leads to stationary generalizations which, however, do not preserve the conformal symmetry. We investigate also the particular case when the seed solution is given by the Schwarzschild spacetime and show that the resulting rotating configuration does not correspond to a vacuum solution, even in the limiting case of slow rotation. In fact, it describes in general a relativistic fluid with anisotropic pressure and heat flux. This implies that the Newman–Janis Ansatz strongly depends on the choice of representation for the seed solution. We interpret this result as a further indication of its applicability limitations.
Stimulated emission by black holes is discussed in light of the analogue gravity program. We first consider initial quantum states containing a definite number of particles, and then we take into account the case where the initial state is a coherent state. The latter case is particularly significant in the case where Hawking radiation is studied in dielectric black holes, and the emission is stimulated by a laser probe. We are particularly interested in the case of the electromagnetic field, for which examples of stimulated radiation are considered.
In this paper, employing the modified dispersion relation, we have derived the general modified Friedmann equations and the corresponding modified entropy relations for the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) Universe. In this setup, we find that when the big bounce happens, its energy scale and its corresponding modified entropy behavior are sensitive to the value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. In contrast to the previous work with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(k=0\)</span>, our work mainly demonstrates that the bouncing behavior for the closed Universe with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(k=1\)</span> appears at the normal energy limit of the modified dispersion relation introduced, and when bouncing phenomenon is in presence, its modified entropy is just equal to zero. Surprisingly, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(k=-1\)</span>, the bouncing behavior is in absence.
In the context of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(2+1\)</span>-dimensional gravity coupled to a particular nonlinear electrodynamics, we obtain a class of traversable/Morris–Thorne type wormhole solutions. The problem is reduced to a single function dependence in which the shape function acts as generator to the wormholes. The field ansatz is pure magnetic and the nonlinear Lagrangian is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\sqrt{F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu }}\)</span> i.e., the square root of the Maxwell Lagrangian. In <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(2+1\)</span>-dimensions the source-free pure magnetic non-linear Maxwell equation with square-root Lagrangian is trivially satisfied. The exotic energy density is found explicitly and the flare-out conditions are emphasized.
An investigation of the strong gravitational lensing in specific model of modified gravity is presented. It is shown that a slight modification to the general relativistic metric near the neighborhood of complete capture can be obtained. The formulae for the position of the critical curves, relativistic images and their magnification in the new metric are calculated and the differences with general relativity are compared. Furthermore, the radius of stable orbits is derived and the critical impact parameter is calculated. Finally, it is shown that in the strong field limit this solution may give a considerable contribution to gravitational lensing.
Using a one-dimensional minisuperspace model with a dimensionless ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\frac{E}{E_{Pl}}\)</span>, we study the initial singularity problem at the quantum level for the closed rainbow cosmology with a homogeneous, isotropic classical space-time background. We derive the classical Hamiltonian within the framework of Schutz’s formalism for an ideal fluid with a cosmological constant. We characterize the behavior of the system at the early stages of the universe evolution through analyzing the relevant shapes for the potential sector of the classical Hamiltonian for various matter sources, each separately modified by two rainbow functions. We show that for both rainbow universe models presented here, there is the possibility of eliminating the initial singularity by forming a potential barrier and static universe for a non-zero value of the scale factor. We investigate their quantum stability and show that for an energy-dependent space-time geometry with energies comparable with the Planck energy, the non-zero value of the scale factor may be stable. It is shown that under certain constraints the rainbow universe model filled with an exotic matter as a domain wall fluid plus a cosmological constant can result in a non-singular harmonic universe. In addition, we demonstrate that the harmonically oscillating universe with respect to the scale factor is sensitive to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\frac{E}{E_{Pl}}\)</span> and that at high energies it may become stable quantum mechanically. Through a Schrödinger–Wheeler–De Witt equation obtained from the quantization of the classical Hamiltonian, we also extract the wave packet of the universe with a focus on the early stages of the evolution. The resulting wave packet supports the existence of a bouncing non-singular universe within the context of gravity’s rainbow proposal.
We study gravitational stealth configurations emerging on a charged dilatonic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((1+1)\)</span>-D black hole spacetime. We accomplish this by considering the coupling of a non-minimally scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\phi \)</span> and a self-interacting scalar field <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\varPsi \)</span> living in a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\((1+1)\)</span>-D charged black hole background. In addition, the self-interacting potential for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\varPsi \)</span> is obtained which exhibits transitions for some specific values of the non-minimal parameter. Atypically, we found that the solutions for these stealth scalar fields do not have a dependence on the temporal coordinate.

Hawking radiation of charged scalar and Dirac particles from the event horizon of magnetized Kerr–Newman black holes is studied using the Hamilton–Jacobi method and WKB approximation. This is done by calculating tunneling probabilities of these particles from the horizons of magnetized black holes. This method yields the Hawking temperature of magnetized Kerr–Newman black holes as well. It is interesting to note that while the tunneling probabilities depend upon the background magnetic field, the Hawking temperature is not affected by magnetization.
Rastall’s theory belongs to the class of non-conservative theories of gravity. In vacuum, the only non-trivial static, spherically symmetric solution is the Schwarzschild one, except for a very special case. When a canonical scalar field is coupled to the gravity sector in this theory, new exact solutions appear for some values of the Rastall parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. Some of these solutions describe the same space–time geometry as the recently found solutions in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>-essence theory with a power function for the kinetic term of the scalar field. There is a large class of solutions (in particular, those describing wormholes and regular black holes) whose geometry coincides with that of solutions of GR coupled to scalar fields with nontrivial self-interaction potentials; the form of these potentials, however, depends on the Rastall parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>. We also note that all solutions of GR with a zero trace of the energy-momentum tensor, including black-hole and wormhole ones, may be re-interpreted as solutions of Rastall’s theory.
We analyse a relativistic scalar particle with a position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation by showing that relativistic bound states solutions can be achieved. Further, we consider the presence of the Coulomb potential and analyse the relativistic position-dependent mass system subject to the Coulomb potential in the spacetime with a space-like dislocation. We also show that a new set of relativistic bound states solutions can be obtained, where there also exists the influence of torsion of the relativistic energy levels. Finally, we investigate an analogue of the Aharonov–Bohm effect for bound states in this position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation.
Higher-dimensional solutions for Einstein–Maxwell equations that generalize the charged Nariai spacetime are obtained. The solutions presented here are made from the direct product of several 2-spaces of constant curvature. These solutions turn out to have many magnetic charges, contrary to the usual higher-dimensional generalization of the Nariai spacetime, which has no magnetic charge at all. These solutions are then used to generate black hole metrics. Finally, it is analyzed how these generalized Nariai solutions are modified in more general theories of gravity.
In the framework of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, we study a gravity theory where a scalar field beyond its minimal coupling, is also coupled to the vector torsion through a non-minimal derivative coupling. After a suitable choice of auxiliary variables that allows us to perform the phase-space analysis of the model we obtain the critical points and their stability. While there is no scaling attractor in the non-interacting scenario, by considering an interaction between dark energy and dark matter, we find scaling attractors in which the fractional densities of dark energy and matter are non-vanishing constants over there. The universe can evolve to these scaling attractors regardless of initial conditions and the cosmological coincidence problem could be alleviated without fine-tunings.
This paper investigates stability of Bardeen thin-shell wormholes constructed by cut and paste technique. We use Israel formalism to evaluate surface energy density as well as pressure and check the behavior of energy conditions. The linearized stability of the respective thin-shell wormholes is investigated by using three choices of variable equation of state; two of them provide stability regions at equilibrium radius. We conclude that stable Bardeen wormhole solutions exist for particular values of equilibrium radius as well as equation of state parameter.
Unlike the one-loop QG divergences in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(D=4\)</span>, which can all be transformed away, those in arbitrary higher (even) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> cannot.
We formulate and prove a toy version of the Penrose inequality. The formulation mimics the original Penrose inequality in which the scenario is the following: a shell of null dust collapses in Minkowski space and a marginally trapped surface forms on it. Through a series of arguments relying on established assumptions, an inequality relating the area of this surface to the total energy of the shell is formulated. Then a further reformulation turns the inequality into a statement relating the area and the outer null expansion of a class of surfaces in Minkowski space itself. The inequality has been proven to hold true in many special cases, but there is no proof in general. In the toy version here presented, an analogous inequality in (2 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span> 1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space turns out to hold true.
The dynamics of a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((3 + 1)\)</span> dimensional homogeneous anisotropic universe is modified by loop quantum cosmology and, consequently, it has generically a big bounce in the past instead of a big-bang singularity. This modified dynamics can be well described by effective equations of motion. We generalise these effective equations of motion empirically to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((d + 1)\)</span> dimensions. The generalised equations involve two functions and may be considered as a class of LQC-inspired models for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\((d + 1)\)</span> dimensional early universe cosmology. As a special case, one can now obtain a universe which has neither a big bang singularity nor a big bounce but approaches asymptotically a ‘Hagedorn like’ phase in the past where its density and volume remain constant. In a few special cases, we also obtain explicit solutions.
We initiated the program to look for new and simple forms for the five-dimensional rotating squashed black holes by solving directly the equation of motion. In a recent paper, the metric ansatz of dimensional reduction along the fifth spatial dimension was used to obtain a new but rather simple form for the five-dimensional rotating uncharged black hole solution with squashed horizons via solving the vacuum Einstein field equations. In this work, we continue to seek for another new but relatively simple form for the neutral rotating squashed black hole solution by using a different metric ansatz of time-like dimensional reduction. We then find its relation to our previous solution and investigate its thermodynamics by means of the counterterm method. Compared with the previous results given by the other author, both of our new metric forms and their associated thermodynamic expressions are very concise and elegant. Both of two new forms for the neutral rotating squashed black hole solution presented in this paper can be used as the seed to generate its charged generalization in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D=5\)</span> minimal supergravity.
The paper focuses on finding out several physical quantities to exert an influence on the spatial parameters of complex-octonion curved space, including the metric coefficient, connection coefficient, and curvature tensor. In the flat space described with the complex octonions, the radius vector is combined with the integrating function of field potential to become a composite radius vector. And the latter can be considered as the radius vector in a flat composite-space (a function space). Further it is able to deduce some formulae between the physical quantity and spatial parameter, in the complex-octonion curved composite-space. Under the condition of weak field approximation, these formulae infer a few results accordant with the general theory of relativity. The study reveals that it is capable of ascertaining which physical quantities are able to result in the warping of space, in terms of the curved composite-space described with the complex octonions. Moreover, the method may be expanded into some curved function spaces, seeking out more possible physical quantities to impact the bending degree of curved spaces.
Regarding the wide applications of dilaton gravity in the presence of electrodynamics, we introduce a suitable Lagrangian for the coupling of dilaton with gauge field. There are various Lagrangians which show the coupling between scalar fields and electrodynamics with correct special situations. In this paper, taking into account conformal transformation of Brans–Dicke theory with an electrodynamics Lagrangian, we show that how scalar field should couple with electrodynamics in dilaton gravity. In other words, in order to introduce a correct Lagrangian of dilaton gravity, one should check at least two requirements: compatibility with Brans–Dicke theory and appropriate special situations. Finally, we apply the mentioned method to obtain analytical solutions of dilaton-Born–Infeld and Brans–Dicke–Born–Infeld theories with energy dependent spacetime.
Quadratic gravity in two dimensions can be formulated as a background field (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BF</em>) theory plus an interaction term which is polynomial in both, the gauge and background fields. This formulation is similar to the one given by Freidel and Starodubtsev to obtain MacDowell–Mansouri gravity in four dimensions. In this article we use the Dirac’s Hamiltonian formalism to analyze the constraint structure of the two-dimensional Polynomial <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">BF</em> action. After we obtain the constraints of the theory, we proceed with the Batalin–Fradkin–Vilkovisky procedure to obtain the transition amplitude. We also compare our results with the ones obtained from generalized dilaton gravity.
In 2007 Rindler and Ishak showed that, contrary to previous claims, the value of the cosmological constant does have an effect on light deflection by a gravitating object in an expanding universe. In their work they considered a Schwarzschild–de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, which has a constant asymptotic expansion rate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(H_0\)</span>. A model with a time-dependent <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) was studied by Kantowski et al., who consider in their 2010 paper a “Swiss-cheese” model of a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) spacetime with an embedded SdS bubble. In this paper, we generalize the Rindler and Ishak model to time-varying <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) in another way, by considering light bending in a McVittie metric representing a gravitating object in a FLRW cosmological background. We carry out numerical simulations of the propagation of null geodesics in different McVittie spacetimes, in which we keep the values of the distances from the observer to the lensing object and to the source fixed, and vary the form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>).
The Geroch–Held–Penrose formalism is used to re-analyse algebraically special non-null Einstein–Maxwell fields, aligned as well as non-aligned, in the presence of a possible non-vanishing cosmological constant. A new invariant characterization is given of the García–Plebański and Plebański–Hacyan metrics within the family of aligned solutions and of the Griffiths metrics within the family of the non-aligned solutions. As a corollary also the double alignment of the Debever–McLenaghan ‘class <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathscr {D}}\)</span>’ metrics with non-vanishing cosmological constant is shown to be equivalent with the shear-free and geodesic behavior of their Debever–Penrose vectors.
We consider the dynamics of a flat anisotropic Universe filled by a perfect fluid near a cosmological singularity in quadratic gravity. Two possible regimes are described—the Kasner anisotropic solution and an isotropic “vacuum radiation” solution which has three sub cases depending on whether the equation of state parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> is bigger, smaller or equals to 1 / 3. Initial conditions for numerical integrations have been chosen near a General Relativity anisotropic solution with matter (Jacobs solution). We have found that for such initial conditions there is a range of values of the coupling constants so that the resulting cosmological singularity is isotropic.
In our paper we investigate the lower limit of collisional energy of test particles near the Kerr black hole. In particular we examine the minimal Lorentz factor between the freely falling particles and the particles orbiting around a black hole. We consider collisions on the innermost stable circular orbit and examine near-extreme case, where collisions take place near an event horizon. By fine-tuning the particles’ angular momentum, the Lorentz factor of the collision can always be minimized to a value dependent on the black hole’s spin. We identified that this minimal value is always less than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\frac{2\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{3}}\)</span> and more than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\frac{\sqrt{12}-1}{\sqrt{6}}\)</span> (the limits are the values for an extreme Kerr and Schwarzschild, respectively). It implies that this kind of collisions of compact objects are expected to be highly energetic near supermassive black holes. In addition, we show that an interaction between black hole’s and particle’s spins has an influence on minimal Lorentz factor. This contribution is nonnegligible for near-extreme black holes. We also discuss the relation between our results and sci-fi movie <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Interstellar</em>.
Assuming that primordial density fluctuations are nearly Gaussian, from a frequentist viewpoint, the two-dimensional marginalized joint coincidence contour in the plane <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((n_s,r)\)</span> (being <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n_s\)</span> the spectral index and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations), without the presence of running is often used to test the viability of the inflationary models. The models that provide, between 50 and 60 e-folds, a curve in that plane lying outside the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(95.5\%\)</span> C.L are ruled out. I will basically argue that, in quintessential inflation, this low number of e-folds is unjustified, and that models leading to a theoretical value of the running different from zero must be checked with observational data allowing the running. When both prescriptions are taken into account, dealing in the context of quintessential inflation, i.e. when the potential is a combination of an inflationary with a quintessential one that leads to a kination (also called deflation) regime, inflationary models such as the quartic or the Higgs potential are allowed.
We investigate gravitational radiation in dynamical noncommutative spaces. By including corrections to the gravitational potential due to dynamical noncommutativity, we calculate the power in gravitational radiation and use observational data to place an upper bound on the noncommutativity parameter. We also study quantum interference induced by gravitational potential in the usual and dynamical noncommutative spaces, and compare the resulting phase difference in these cases with that in commutative space.
Starting from a Geometrothermodynamics metric for the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states in the mass representation, we use numerical techniques to analyse the thermodynamic geodesics of a supermassive Reissner Nordström black hole in isolation. Appropriate constraints are obtained by taking into account the processes of Hawking radiation and Schwinger pair-production. We model the black hole in line with the work of Hiscock and Weems (Phys Rev D 41:1142–1151, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1990</a></span>). It can be deduced that the relation which the geodesics establish between the entropy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> and electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> of the black hole extremises changes in the black hole’s mass. Indeed, the expression for the entropy of an extremal black hole is an exact solution to the geodesic equation. We also find that in certain cases, the geodesics describe the evolution brought about by the constant emission of Hawking radiation and charged-particle pairs.
The paper deals with the problem of describing fundamental particles. The Einstein–Rosen approach was revisited to explain the charge–mass ratio quantization. Such a result is obtained once a quantization prescription is applied to the expression of gravitational energy defined in the realm of teleparallel gravity.
Different proposals for regular rotating black hole spacetimes have appeared recently in the literature. However, a rigorous analysis and proof of the regularity of this kind of spacetimes is still lacking. In this note we analyze rotating Kerr-like black hole spacetimes and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the regularity of all their second order scalar invariants polynomial in the Riemann tensor. We also show that the regularity is linked to a violation of the weak energy conditions around the core of the rotating black hole.
In this paper, we study the dynamics of self-gravitating fluid using structure scalars for spherical geometry in the context of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>) cosmology. We construct structure scalars through orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor and deduce a complete set of equations governing the evolution of dissipative anisotropic fluid in terms of these scalars. We explore different causes of density inhomogeneity which turns out to be a necessary condition for viable models. It is explicitly shown that anisotropic inhomogeneous static spherically symmetric solutions can be expressed in terms of these scalar functions.
Gravitational collapse singularities are undesirable, yet inevitable to a large extent in General Relativity. When matter satisfying null energy condition (NEC) collapses to the extent a closed trapped surface is formed, a singularity is inevitable according to Penrose’s singularity theorem. Since positive mass vacuum solutions are generally black holes with trapped surfaces inside the event horizon, matter cannot collapse to an arbitrarily small size without generating a singularity. However, in modified theories of gravity where positive mass vacuum solutions are naked singularities with no trapped surfaces, it is reasonable to expect that matter can collapse to an arbitrarily small size without generating a singularity. Here we examine this possibility in the context of a modified theory of gravity with torsion in an extra dimension. We study singularity-free static shell solutions to evaluate the validity of NEC on the shell. We find that with sufficiently high pressure, matter can be collapsed to arbitrarily small size without violating NEC and without producing a singularity.
Horizons are classical causal structures that arise in systems with sharply defined energy and corresponding gravitational radius. A global gravitational radius operator can be introduced for a static and spherically symmetric quantum mechanical matter state by lifting the classical “Hamiltonian” constraint that relates the gravitational radius to the ADM mass, thus giving rise to a “horizon wave-function”. This minisuperspace-like formalism is shown here to be able to consistently describe also the local gravitational radius related to the Misner–Sharp mass function of the quantum source, provided its energy spectrum is determined by spatially localised modes.
The boundary at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span>, future null infinity, for a standard static, spherically symmetric spactime is examined for possible linear connections. Two independent methods are employed, one for treating <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span> as the future causal boundary, and one for treating it as a conformal boundary (the latter is subsumed in the former, which is of greater generality). Both methods provide the same result: a constellation of various possible connections, depending on an arbitrary choice of a certain function, a sort of gauge freedom in obtaining a natural connection on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span>; choosing that function to be constant (for instance) results in a complete connection. Treating <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span> as part of the future causal boundary, the method is to impute affine connections on null hypersurfaces going out to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span>, in terms of a transverse vector field on each null hypersurface (there is much gauge freedom on choice of the transverse vector fields). Treating <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\mathcal {I}^+\)</span> as part of a conformal boundary, the method is to make a choice of conformal factor that makes the boundary totally geodesic in the enveloping manifold (there is much gauge freedom in choice of that conformal factor). Similar examination is made of other boundaries, such as timelike infinity and timelike and spacelike singularities. These are much simpler, as they admit a unique connection from a similar limiting process (i.e., no gauge freedom); and that connection is complete.
We examine the effect that the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor has on the large-scale expansion of space. This is done within the context of a class of cosmological models that contain regularly arranged discrete masses, rather than a continuous perfect fluid. The natural set of geodesic curves that one should use to consider the cosmological expansion of these models requires the existence of a non-zero magnetic part of the Weyl tensor. We include this object in the evolution equations of these models by performing a Taylor series expansion about a hypersurface where it initially vanishes. At the same cosmological time, measured as a fraction of the age of the universe, we find that the influence of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases as the number of masses in the universe is increased. We also find that the influence of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases with time, relative to the leading-order electric part, so that its contribution to the scale of the universe can reach values of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sim \)</span>1%, before the Taylor series approximation starts to break down.
The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>–<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> criticality and phase transition in the extended phase space of a noncommutative geometry inspired Reissner–Nordström (RN) black hole in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time are studied, where the cosmological constant appears as a dynamical pressure and its conjugate quantity is thermodynamic volume of the black hole. It is found that the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>–<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> criticality and the small black hole/large black hole phase transition appear for the noncommutative RN-AdS black hole. Numerical calculations indicate that the noncommutative parameter affects the phase transition as well as the critical temperature, horizon radius, pressure and ratio. The critical ratio is no longer universal, which is different from the result in the van de Waals liquid–gas system. The nature of phase transition at the critical point is also discussed. Especially, for the noncommutative geometry inspired RN-AdS black hole, a new thermodynamic quantity <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varPsi \)</span> conjugate to the noncommutative parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\theta \)</span> has to be defined further, which is required for consistency of both the first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr relation.
In this paper, we discuss the geodesic motions of test particles in the intermediate vacuum between a monopolar core and an exterior shell of dipoles, quadrupoles and octopoles. The radii of the innermost stable circular orbits at the equatorial plane depend only on the quadrupoles. A given oblate quadrupolar leads to the existence of two innermost stable circular orbits, and their radii are larger than in the Schwarzschild spacetime. However, a given prolate quadrupolar corresponds to only one innermost stable circular orbit, and its radius is smaller than in the Schwarzschild spacetime. As to the general geodesic orbits, one of the recently developed extended phase space fourth order explicit symplectic-like methods is efficiently applicable to them although the Hamiltonian of the relativistic core–shell system is not separable. With the aid of both this fast integrator without secular growth in the energy errors and gauge invariant chaotic indicators, the effect of these shell multipoles on the geodesic dynamics of order and chaos is estimated numerically.
Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), also referred as Modified Gravity (MOG), is an alternative theory of the gravitational interaction. Its weak field approximation has been successfully used to describe Solar System observations, galaxy rotation curves, dynamics of clusters of galaxies, and cosmological data, without the imposition of dark components. The theory was formulated by John Moffat in 2006. In this work, we derive matter-sourced solutions of STVG and construct neutron star models. We aim at exploring STVG predictions about stellar structure in the strong gravity regime. Specifically, we represent spacetime with a static, spherically symmetric manifold, and model the stellar matter content with a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor. We then derive the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation in STVG and integrate it for different equations of state. We find that STVG allows heavier neutron stars than General Relativity (GR). Maximum masses depend on a normalized parameter that quantifies the deviation from GR. The theory exhibits unusual predictions for extreme values of this parameter. We conclude that STVG admits suitable spherically symmetric solutions with matter sources, relevant for stellar structure. Since recent determinations of neutron stars masses violate some GR predictions, STVG appears as a viable candidate for a new gravity theory.
We study the quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbations in the background of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We find that the quasinormal frequencies have no real part so there is no oscillatory behavior in the perturbations, only exponential decay, that is, the system is always overdamped, which guarantees the mode stability of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We determine analytically the quasinormal modes for massless scalar fields for a dynamical exponent <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(z=2\)</span> and hyperscaling violating exponent <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\tilde{\theta }&gt;-2\)</span>. Also, we obtain numerically the quasinormal frequencies for different values of the dynamical exponent and the hyperscaling violating exponent by using the improved asymptotic iteration method.
We analyse configurations of neutron stars in the so-called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>-squared gravity in the Palatini formalism. Using a realistic equation of state we show that the mass–radius configurations are lighter than their counterparts in General Relativity. We also obtain the internal profiles, which run in strong correlation with the derivatives of the equation of state, leading to regions where the mass parameter decreases with the radial coordinate in a counter-intuitive way. In order to analyse such correlation, we introduce a parametrisation of the equation of state given by multiple polytropes, which allows us to explicitly control its derivatives. We show that, even in a limiting case where hard phase transitions in matter are allowed, the internal profile of the mass parameter still presents strange features and the calculated <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathrm{mass}-\mathrm{radius}\)</span> configurations also yield neutron stars lighter than those obtained in General Relativity.
An analogue of the Oppenheimer–Synder collapsing model is treated analytically, where the matter source is a scalar field with an exponential potential. An exact solution is derived followed by matching to a suitable exterior geometry, and an analysis of the visibility of the singularity. In some situations, the collapse indeed leads to a finite time curvature singularity, which is always hidden from the exterior by an apparent horizon.
In this paper we consider codimension two marginally trapped submanifolds in the family of general Robertson–Walker spacetimes. In particular, we derive some rigidity results for this type of submanifolds which guarantee that, under appropriate hypothesis, the only ones are those contained in slices. We also derive some interesting non-existence results for weakly trapped submanifolds. In particular, we give applications to some cases of physical relevance such as the Einstein-de Sitter spacetime and certain open regions of de Sitter spacetime, including the so called steady state spacetime. Our results will be an application of the (finite) maximum principle for closed manifolds and, more generally, of the weak maximum principle for stochastically complete manifolds.
Solutions to Einstein’s equations in the form of a Robinson–Trautman metric are presented. In particular, we derive a pure radiation solution which is non-stationary and involves a mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>, The resulting spacetime is of Petrov Type II A special selection of parametric values throws up the feature of the particle ‘rocket’, a Type D metric. A suitable transformation of the complex coordinates allows the metrics to be expressed in real form. A modification, by setting <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> to zero, of the Type II metric thereby converting it to Type III, is then shown to admit a null Einstein–Maxwell electromagnetic field.
Considering an inhomogeneous brane embedded in a five dimensional constant curvature bulk, we find the non-static and spherically symmetric exact solutions of the Einstein equations on the brane. With different choices of the parameters, one interesting case/solution is studied. We show that an inhomogeneous brane model can explain the accelerated expansion of the universe at large distance scales and also the galaxy rotation curves of spiral galaxies without assuming the existence of dark matter or new modified theories at the galactic scales.
In this work, the dynamic of isolated systems in general relativity is described when gravitational radiation and electromagnetic fields are present. In this construction, the asymptotic fields received at null infinity together with the regularized null cone cuts equation, and the center of mass of an asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell spacetime are used. A set of equations are derived in the low speed regime, linking their time evolution to the emitted gravitational radiation and to the Maxwell fields received at infinity. These equations should be useful when describing the dynamic of compact sources, such as the final moments of binary coalescence and the evolution of the final black hole. Additionally, we compare our equations with those coming from a similar approach given by Newman, finding some differences in the motion of the center of mass and spin of the gravitational system.
One of the main interest in quantum cosmology is to determine boundary conditions for the wave function of the universe which can predict observational data of our universe. For this purpose, we solve the Wheeler–DeWitt equation for a closed universe with a scalar field numerically and evaluate probabilities for boundary conditions of the wave function of the universe. To impose boundary conditions of the wave function, we use exact solutions of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation with a constant scalar field potential. These exact solutions include wave functions with well known boundary condition proposals, the no-boundary proposal and the tunneling proposal. We specify the exact solutions by introducing two real parameters to discriminate boundary conditions, and obtain the probability for these parameters under the requirement of sufficient e-foldings of the inflation. The probability distribution of boundary conditions prefers the tunneling boundary condition to the no-boundary boundary condition. Furthermore, for large values of a model parameter related to the inflaton mass and the cosmological constant, the probability of boundary conditions selects an unique boundary condition different from the tunneling type.
This is the republished English edition of a paper by E. Lifshitz, first published in 1946, in which the author investigates the gravitational stability of the non–stationary isotropic models of the universe. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by George F. R. Ellis, and by a brief biography of Evgenii Mikhailovich Lifshitz, written by Andrzej Krasiński.

A characterization of the foliation by spacelike slices of an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((n+1)\)</span>-dimensional spatially closed Generalized Robertson–Walker spacetime is given by means of studying a natural mean curvature type equation on spacelike graphs. Under some natural assumptions, of physical or geometric nature, all the entire solutions of such an equation are obtained. In particular, the case of entire spacelike graphs in de Sitter spacetime is faced and completely solved by means of a new application of a known integral formula.
The Unruh vacuum not admitting any outgoing flux at the horizon implies that the origin of the outgoing Hawking radiation is the atmosphere of a near-horizon quantum region without resort to the firewall; however, the existence of the firewall of superplanckian excitations at the horizon can be supported by the infinite Tolman temperature at the horizon. In an exactly soluble model, we explicitly show that the firewall necessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum so that the Tolman temperature in the Unruh vacuum is divergent in essence due to the infinitely blueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon rather than the outgoing flux. We also show that the outgoing Hawking radiation in the Unruh vacuum indeed originates from the atmosphere, not just at the horizon, which is of no relevance to the infinite blueshift. Consequently, the firewall from the infinite Tolman temperature and the Hawking radiation from the atmosphere turn out to be compatible, once we waive the claim that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh vacuum originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the horizon.
In this paper we study the quantum cosmology of homogeneous and isotropic cosmology, via the Weyl–Wigner–Groenewold–Moyal formalism of phase space quantization, with perfect fluid as a matter source. The corresponding quantum cosmology is described by the Moyal–Wheeler-DeWitt equation which has exact solutions in Moyal phase space, resulting in Wigner quasiprobability distribution functions peaking around the classical paths for large values of scale factor. We show that the Wigner functions of these models are peaked around the non-singular universes with quantum modified density parameter of radiation.
We discuss motions of extended bodies in Kerr spacetime by using Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations. We firstly solve the conditions for circular orbits, and calculate the orbital frequency shift due to the mass quadrupoles. The results show that we need not consider the spin-induced quadrupoles in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals for space-based gravitational wave detectors. We quantitatively investigate the temporal variation of rotational velocity of the extended body due to the coupling of quadrupole and background gravitational field. For generic orbits, we numerically integrate the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations for evolving the motion of an extended body orbiting a Kerr black hole. By comparing with the monopole–dipole approximation, we reveal the influences of quadrupole moments of extended bodies on the orbital motion and chaotic dynamics of extreme-mass-ratio systems. We do not find any chaotic orbits for the extended bodies with physical spins and spin-induced quadrupoles. Possible implications for gravitational wave detection and pulsar timing observation are outlined.
The paper deals with a detailed study of the stability criteria for general static cylindrical thin-shell wormhole.The stability analysis is done under perturbations preserving the symmetry for two definitions of the throat of the wormhole separately. Finally, the stability conditions are discussed both geometrically and physically.
In this article we study self-gravitating static solutions of the Einstein-Scalar Field system in arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the existence of geodesically complete solutions depending on the form of the scalar field potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V(\phi )\)</span>, and provide full global geometric estimates when the solutions exist. The most complete results are obtained for the physically important Klein–Gordon field and are summarised as follows. When <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(V(\phi )=m^{2}|\phi |^{2}\)</span>, it is proved that geodesically complete solutions have Ricci-flat spatial metric, have constant lapse and are vacuum, (that is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\phi \)</span> is constant and equal to zero if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(m\ne 0\)</span>). In particular, when the spatial dimension is three, the only such solutions are either Minkowski or a quotient thereof (no nontrivial solutions exist). When <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(V(\phi )=m^{2}|\phi |^{2}+2\Lambda \)</span>, that is, when a vacuum energy or a cosmological constant is included, it is proved that no geodesically complete solution exists when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span>, whereas when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span> it is proved that no non-vacuum geodesically complete solution exists unless <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(m^{2}&lt;-2\Lambda /(n-1)\)</span>, (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> is the spatial dimension) and the spatial manifold is non-compact. The proofs are based on novel techniques in comparison geometry <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">á la Bakry-Émery</em> that have their own interest.
In this work, an exact regular black hole solution in General Relativity is presented. The source is a nonlinear electromagnetic field with the algebraic structure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\( T^{0}_{0}=T^{1}_{1} \)</span> for the energy–momentum tensor, partially satisfying the weak energy condition but not the strong energy condition. In the weak field limit, the EM field behaves like the Maxwell field. The solution corresponds to a charged black hole with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(q\le 0.77\)</span> <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\hbox {m}\)</span>. The metric, the curvature invariants, and the electric field are regular everywhere. The BH is stable against small perturbations of spacetime and using the Weinhold metric, geometrothermodynamical stability has been investigated. Finally we investigate the idea that the observable universe lives inside a regular black hole. We argue that this picture might provide a viable description of universe.
In this work, we focus on the theory of gravito-electromagnetism (GEM)—the theory that describes the dynamics of the gravitational field in terms of quantities met in electromagnetism—and we propose two novel forms of metric perturbations. The first one is a generalisation of the traditional GEM ansatz, and succeeds in reproducing the whole set of Maxwell’s equations even for a dynamical vector potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathbf {A}\)</span>. The second form, the so-called alternative ansatz, goes beyond that leading to an expression for the Lorentz force that matches the one of electromagnetism and is free of additional terms even for a dynamical scalar potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varPhi \)</span>. In the context of the linearised theory, we then search for scalar invariant quantities in analogy to electromagnetism. We define three novel, 3rd-rank gravitational tensors, and demonstrate that the last two can be employed to construct scalar quantities that succeed in giving results very similar to those found in electromagnetism. Finally, the gauge invariance of the linearised gravitational theory is studied, and shown to lead to the gauge invariance of the GEM fields <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathbf {E}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathbf {B}\)</span> for a general configuration of the arbitrary vector involved in the coordinate transformations.
In the framework of a model based on the gravitational field of the Kerr black hole, we turn to investigate the kinematic behavior of extragalactic jets. We analytically calculate the observable velocities and accelerations along any geodesic. Then, by numerical calculations, we apply our results to a geodesic, typical of the M87 jet, and probe our results by confrontation to recent observations. A transition from non-relativistic to ultrarelativistic speeds at subparsec scale is highlighted. This transition comes sooner and more abruptly than in models based on magnetic paradigm, which indicates that we need a weaker magnetic field to explain observed synchrotron radiation. We attribute the ejection phenomenon to the repulsive effect of the gravitomagnetic Kerr field.
This article deals with the concepts “renaissance” and “low water mark between 1925 and 1955” of general relativity suggested in the literature. By empirical data, it is shown that no such period did exist. Research on general relativity continued continuously since the 1920s interrupted only by the second world war. On a broad scale, research on general relativity started only after 1945.
It is shown that continuous causal isomorphisms on two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime can be characterized by the invariance of wave equations.

The separability of the massive Dirac equation in the non-extreme Kerr geometry in horizon-penetrating advanced Eddington–Finkelstein-type coordinates is shown. To this end, Kerr geometry is described by a Carter tetrad and the Dirac spinors and matrices are given in a chiral Newman–Penrose dyad representation. Applying Chandrasekhar’s mode ansatz, the Dirac equation is separated into systems of radial and angular ordinary differential equations. Asymptotic radial solutions at infinity, the event horizon, and the Cauchy horizon are explicitly derived. Their decay is analyzed by means of error estimates. Moreover, the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the angular system are discussed. Finally, as an application, the scattering of Dirac waves by the gravitational field of a Kerr black hole is studied. This work provides the basis for a Hamiltonian formulation of the massive Dirac equation in Kerr geometry in horizon-penetrating coordinates and for the construction of a functional analytic integral representation of the Dirac propagator.
Witten’s proof for the positivity of the ADM mass gives a definition of energy in terms of three-surface spinors. In this paper, we give a generalisation for the remaining six Poincaré charges at spacelike infinity, which are the angular momentum and centre of mass. The construction improves on certain three-surface spinor equations introduced by Shaw. We solve these equations asymptotically obtaining the ten Poincaré charges as integrals over the Nester–Witten two-form. We point out that the defining differential equations can be extended to three-surfaces of arbitrary signature and we study them on the entire boundary of a compact four-dimensional region of spacetime. The resulting quasi-local expressions for energy and angular momentum are integrals over a two-dimensional cross-section of the boundary. For any two consecutive such cross-sections, conservation laws are derived that determine the influx (outflow) of matter and gravitational radiation.
We model the dynamics of a spherically symmetric radiating dynamical star with three spacetime regions. The local internal atmosphere is a two-component system consisting of standard pressure-free, null radiation and an additional string fluid with energy density and nonzero pressure obeying all physically realistic energy conditions. The middle region is purely radiative which matches to a third region which is the Schwarzschild exterior. A large family of solutions to the field equations are presented for various realistic equations of state. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain solutions via a direct integration of the second order equations resulting from the assumption of an equation of state. A comparison of our solutions with earlier well known results is undertaken and we show that all these solutions, including those of Husain, are contained in our family. We then generalise our class of solutions to higher dimensions. Finally we consider the effects of diffusive transport and transparently derive the specific equations of state for which this diffusive behaviour is possible.
The GRG journal’s Golden Oldies series has republished more than 80 important old papers in general relativity and gravitation. This announcement updates and replaces the one made in Gen. Relativ.

The viability of the variable generalised Chaplygin gas (VGCG) model is analysed from the standpoint of its thermodynamical stability criteria with the help of an equation of state, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(P = - \frac{B}{\rho ^{\alpha } }\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(B = B_{0}V^{-\frac{n}{3}}\)</span>. Here <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(B_{0}\)</span> is assumed to be a positive universal constant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> is a constant parameter and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> is the volume of the cosmic fluid. We get the interesting result that if the well-known stability conditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> are constrained to be negative definite to make <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\( \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right) _{S} &lt;0\)</span> &amp; <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\( \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right) _{T} &lt;0\)</span> throughout the evolution. Moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(c_{V}\)</span> as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured in this case. For the particular case <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(n = 0\)</span> the effective equation of state reduces to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model in the late stage of the universe while for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(n &lt;0\)</span> it mimics a phantom-like cosmology which is in broad agreement with the present SNe Ia constraints like VGCG model. The thermal equation of state is discussed and the EoS parameter is found to be an explicit function of temperature only. Further for large volume the thermal equation of state parameter is identical with the caloric equation of state parameter when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\( T \rightarrow 0\)</span>. It may also be mentioned that like Santos et al. our model does not admit of any critical points. We also observe that although the earlier model of Lu explains many of the current observational findings of different probes it fails to explain the crucial tests of thermodynamical stability.
By starting with a seed Newtonian potential–density pair we construct relativistic thick spherical shell models for a Majumdar–Papapetrou type conformastatic spacetime. As a simple example, we considerer a family of Plummer–Hernquist type relativistic spherical shells. As a second application, these structures are then used to model a system composite by a dust disk and a halo of matter. We study the equatorial circular motion of test particles around such configurations. Also the stability of the orbits is analyzed for radial perturbation using an extension of the Rayleigh criterion. The models considered satisfying all the energy conditions.
Following the approach of Adamo–Newman–Kozameh (ANK) we derive the equations of motion for the center of mass and intrinsic angular moment for isolated sources of gravitational waves in axially symmetric spacetimes. The original ANK formulation is generalized so that the angular momentum coincides with the Komar integral for a rotational Killing symmetry. This is done using the Winicour–Tamburino Linkages which yields the mass dipole-angular momentum tensor for the isolated sources. The ANK formalism then provides a complex worldline in a fiducial flat space to define the notions of center of mass and spin. The equations of motion are derived and then used to analyse a very simple astrophysical process where only quadrupole and octupole contributions are included. The results are then compared with those coming from the post newtonian approximation.
The curvature tensor and its derivatives up to any order can be covariantly characterized by a minimal set of spinor quantities. On the other hand it might be useful, particularly in cosmology, to describe the geometry of a spacetime in a (1+3) formalism, based on an invariantly defined fluid velocity. In this work, we consider an imperfect fluid possessing both isotropic and anisotropic pressure. For these fluids, we determine the (1+3) matter terms of the curvature as well as the parts of the first order covariant derivative of the curvature (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\nabla R\)</span>) determined pointwise by the matter via the Bianchi identities. Explicit relations between the set of such terms obtained from the (1+3) and spinor decomposition of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\nabla R\)</span> are given. We show that in both sets there are 36 independent terms.
The implications from the existence of a proper Homothetic Vector Field on the dynamics of vacuum anisotropic models in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravitational theory are studied. The fact that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">every</em> Spatially Homogeneous vacuum model is equivalent, formally, with a “flux”-free anisotropic fluid model in standard gravity and the induced power-law form of the functional <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) due to self-similarity enable us to close the system of equations. We found some new exact anisotropic solutions that arise as fixed points in the associated dynamical system. The non-existence of Kasner-like (Bianchi type I) solutions in proper <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>)-gravity (i.e. <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R\ne 0\)</span>) strengthens the belief that curvature corrections will prevent the shear influence into the past thus permitting an isotropic singularity. We also discuss certain issues regarding the lack of vacuum models of type III, IV, VII<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(_{h}\)</span> in comparison with the corresponding results in standard gravity.
We discuss the energy density, temperature and entropy of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) as functions of the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> in an expanding universe. In a model of non-interacting dark components we repeat a derivation from thermodynamics of the well-known relations between the energy density, entropy and temperature. In particular, the entropy is constant as a consequence of the energy conservation. We consider a model of a DM/DE interaction where the DM energy density increase is proportional to the particle density. In such a model the dependence of the energy density and the temperature on the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em> is substantially modified. We discuss (as a realization of the model) DM which consists of relativistic particles diffusing in an environment of DE. The energy gained by the dark matter comes from a cosmological fluid with a negative pressure. We define the entropy and free energy of such a non-equilibrium system. We show that during the universe evolution the entropy of DM is increasing whereas the entropy of DE is decreasing. The total entropy can increase (in spite of the energy conservation) as the DM and DE temperatures are different. We discuss non-equilibrium thermodynamics on the basis of the notion of the relative entropy.
We extend the Parikh–Wilczek method from Einstein gravity spacetime to Gauss–Bonnet modified gravity and study the tunneling radiation of particles across the event horizon of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet Anti de-Sitter black hole. The emission rate of a particle is calculated. It is shown that the emission rate of massive particles takes the same functional form as that of massless particles although that their motion equations tunneling across the horizon are different. It is also shown that the emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum but is consistent with an underlying unitary theory. In addition, significant but interesting phenomenon is demonstrated when Gauss–Bonnet term is present. The expression of the emission rate for a black hole in Gauss–Bonnet gravity differs from that for a black hole in Einstein gravity. After adopting the conventional tunneling rate, we obtain the expression of the entropy of the Gauss–Bonnet black hole, which is in accordance with the early results but does not obey the area law. So the research of tunneling radiation in this paper may serve as a new perspective of understanding the thermodynamics of black holes in Gauss–Bonnet gravity.
We extend significantly previous works on the Hilbert space representations of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in 3 + 1 dimensions of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\([X_i,P_j] = i F_{ij}\)</span> where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(F_{ij} = f({\mathbf {P}}^2) \delta _{ij} + g({\mathbf {P}}^2) P_i P_j\)</span> for any functions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>. However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>’s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal length that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level, there exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum algebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of operators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the symmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a completely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with momentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space representations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional analysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a minimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of translations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship is preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal length is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding Aquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of this model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of translations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends on the precise shape of the function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em> defined previously. This result provides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum gravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.
In the present work we revisit a model consisting of a scalar field with a quartic self-interaction potential non-minimally (conformally) coupled to gravity (Novello in Phys Lett 90A:347 <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1980</a></span>). When the scalar field vacuum is in a broken symmetry state, an effective gravitational constant emerges which, in certain regimes, can lead to gravitational repulsive effects when only ordinary radiation is coupled to gravity. In this case, a bouncing universe is shown to be the only cosmological solution admissible by the field equations when the scalar field is in such broken symmetry state.
The interaction between gravitons and fermions is investigated in the teleparallel gravity. The scattering of fermions and gravitons in the weak field approximation is analyzed. The transition amplitudes of M<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varnothing \)</span>ller, Compton and new gravitational scattering are calculated.
In this paper, by proposing a generalized <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">specific</em> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">volume</em>, we restudy the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>–<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">V</em> criticality of charged AdS black holes in the extended phase space. The results show that most of the previous conclusions can be generalized without change, but the ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\tilde{\rho }}_c\)</span> should be <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(3 {\tilde{\alpha }}/16\)</span> in general case. Further research on the thermodynamical phase transition of black hole leads us to a natural interpretation of our assumption, and more black hole properties can be generalized. Finally, we study the number density for charged AdS black hole in higher dimensions, the results show the necessity of our assumption.
We consider the scale-invariant inflationary model studied in Rinaldi and Vanzo (Phys Rev D 94: 024009, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2016</a></span>). The Lagrangian includes all the scale-invariant operators that can be built with combinations of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(R, R^{2}\)</span> and one scalar field. The equations of motion show that the symmetry is spontaneously broken after an arbitrarily long inflationary period and a fundamental mass scale is generated. Upon symmetry breaking, and in the Jordan frame, both Hubble function and the scalar field undergo damped oscillations that can eventually amplify Standard Model fields and reheat the Universe. In the present work, we study in detail inflation and the reheating mechanism of this model in the Einstein frame and we compare some of the results with the latest observational data.
Robertson–Walker and generalized Robertson–Walker spacetimes may be characterized by the existence of a time-like unit torse-forming vector field, with other constrains. We show that Twisted manifolds may still be characterized by the existence of such (unique) vector field, with no other constrain. Twisted manifolds generalize RW and GRW spacetimes by admitting a scale function that depends both on time and space. We obtain the Ricci tensor, corresponding to the stress–energy tensor of an imperfect fluid.
The Raychaudhuri equation enables to examine the whole spacetime structure without specific solutions of Einstein’s equations, playing a central role for the understanding of the gravitational interaction in cosmology. In General Relativity, without considering a cosmological constant, a non-positive contribution in the Raychaudhuri equation is usually interpreted as the manifestation of the attractive character of gravity. In this case, particular energy conditions—indeed the strong energy condition—must be assumed in order to guarantee the attractive character. In the context of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, however, even assuming the standard energy conditions one may have a positive contribution to the Raychaudhuri equation. Besides providing a simple way to explain the observed cosmic acceleration, this fact opens the possibility of a repulsive character of this kind of gravity. In order to discuss physical bounds on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models, we address the attractive/non-attractive character of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity considering the Raychaudhuri equation and assuming the strong energy condition along with recent estimates of the cosmographic parameters.
Using scalar–vector–tensor Brans Dicke (VBD) gravity (Ghaffarnejad in Gen Relativ Gravit 40:2229, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20">2008</a></span>; Gen Relativ Gravit 41:2941, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21">2009</a></span>) in presence of self interaction BD potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V(\phi )\)</span> and perfect fluid matter field action we solve corresponding field equations via dynamical system approach for flat Friedmann Robertson Walker metric (FRW). We obtained three type critical points for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda CDM\)</span> vacuum de Sitter era where stability of our solutions are depended to choose particular values of BD parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\omega \)</span>. One of these fixed points is supported by a constant potential which is stable for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\omega &lt;0\)</span> and behaves as saddle (quasi stable) for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\omega \ge 0\)</span>. Two other ones are supported by a linear potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(V(\phi )\sim \phi \)</span> which one of them is stable for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\omega =0.27647\)</span>. For a fixed value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\omega \)</span> there is at least 2 out of 3 critical points reaching to a unique critical point. Namely for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\omega =-0.16856(-0.56038)\)</span> the second (third) critical point become unique with the first critical point. In dust and radiation eras we obtained one critical point which never become unique fixed point. In the latter case coordinates of fixed points are also depended to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\omega \)</span>. To determine stability of our solutions we calculate eigenvalues of Jacobi matrix of 4D phase space dynamical field equations for de Sitter, dust and radiation eras. We should point also potentials which support dust and radiation eras must be similar to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(V(\phi )\sim \phi ^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(V(\phi )\sim \phi ^{-1}\)</span> respectively. In short our study predicts that radiation and dust eras of our VBD–FRW cosmology transmit to stable de Sitter state via non-constant potential (effective variable cosmological parameter) by choosing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(\omega =0.27647\)</span>.
We consider <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional solutions to the electrovacuum Einstein–Maxwell equations with the Weyl tensor of type N and a null Maxwell <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((p+1)\)</span>-form field. We prove that such spacetimes are necessarily aligned, i.e. the Weyl tensor of the corresponding spacetime and the electromagnetic field share the same <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">aligned null direction</em> (AND). Moreover, this AND is geodetic, shear-free, non-expanding and non-twisting and hence Einstein–Maxwell equations imply that Weyl type N spacetimes with a null Maxwell <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((p+1)\)</span>-form field belong to the Kundt class. Moreover, these Kundt spacetimes are necessarily <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({ CSI}\)</span> and the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((p+1)\)</span>-form is <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\({ VSI}\)</span>. Finally, a general coordinate form of solutions and a reduction of the field equations are discussed.
In this work, we consider a generalization of quantum electrodynamics including Lorentz violation and torsional-gravity, in the context of general spinor fields as classified in the Lounesto scheme. Singular spinor fields will be shown to be less sensitive to the Lorentz violation, as far as couplings between the spinor bilinear covariants and torsion are regarded. In addition, we prove that flagpole spinor fields do not admit minimal coupling to the torsion. In general, mass dimension four couplings are deeply affected when singular—flagpoles—spinors are considered, instead of the usual Dirac spinors. We also construct a mapping between spinors in the covariant framework and spinors in Lorentz symmetry breaking scenarios, showing how one may transliterate spinors of different classes between the two cases. Specific examples concerning the mapping of Dirac spinor fields in Lorentz violating scenarios into flagpole and flag-dipole spinors with full Lorentz invariance (including the cases of Weyl and Majorana spinors) are worked out.
In the present work we study strange stars in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories of gravity in the Palatini formalism. We consider two concrete well-known cases, namely the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R+R^2/(6 M^2)\)</span> model as well as the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(R-\mu ^4/R\)</span> model for two different values of the mass parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> or <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mu \)</span>. We integrate the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations numerically, and we show the mass-radius diagram for each model separately. The standard case corresponding to the General Relativity is also shown in the same figure for comparison. Our numerical results show that the interior solution can be vastly different depending on the model and/or the value of the parameter of each model. In addition, our findings imply that (i) for the cosmologically interesting values of the mass scales <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(M,\mu \)</span> the effect of modified gravity on strange stars is negligible, while (ii) for the values predicting an observable effect, the modified gravity models discussed here would be ruled out by their cosmological effects.
We study the stability of three analytical solutions of the Einstein’s field equations for spheres of fluid. These solutions are suitable to describe compact objects including white dwarfs, neutron stars and supermassive stars and they have been extensively employed in the literature. We re-examine the range of stability of the Tolman VII solution, we focus on the stability of the Buchdahl solution which is under contradiction in the literature and we examine the stability of the Nariai IV solution. We found that all the mentioned solutions are stable in an extensive range of the compactness parameter. We also concentrate on the effect of the adiabatic index on the instability condition. We found that the critical adiabatic index, depends linearly on the ratio of central pressure over central energy density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(P_c/{\mathcal{E}}_c\)</span>, up to high values of the compactness. Finally, we examine the possibility to impose constraints, via the adiabatic index, on realistic equations of state in order to ensure stable configurations of compact objects.
A class of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em>-dimensional black holes space-time with the perturbed geometric function and dilaton field is considered to study meson spectroscopy. Holographic description of the black holes are used to investigate the meson spectra and the effective potential of mesons which described by a massless scalar field in the d-dimensional black holes with a dilaton background. The effects of perturbations and extra dimensions on the meson spectra and effective potential are investigated by using some experimental data and simulation of spectra ratios.
Every evolution of a fluid is uniquely described by an energy tensor. But the converse is not true: an energy tensor may describe the evolution of different fluids. The problem of determining them is called here the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">inverse problem</em>. This problem may admit unphysical or non-deterministic solutions. This paper is devoted to solve the inverse problem for perfect energy tensors in the class of perfect fluids evolving in local thermal equilibrium (l.t.e.). The starting point is a previous result (Coll and Ferrando in J Math Phys 30:2918–2922, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">1989</a></span>) showing that thermodynamic fluids evolving in l.t.e. admit a purely hydrodynamic characterization. This characterization allows solving this inverse problem in a very compact form. The paradigmatic case of perfect energy tensors representing the evolution of ideal gases is studied in detail and some applications and examples are outlined.
This paper is devoted to investigate Noether symmetries of Bianchi type II spacetimes. We use the reduced involutive form of the determining equations to classify their possible algebras. We show that Noether symmetries contain both Killing vectors and homothetic motions.
For charged black holes in Hořava–Lifshitz gravity, a second order phase transition takes place in extended phase space where the cosmological constant is taken as thermodynamic pressure. We relate the second order nature of phase transition to the fact that the phase transition occurs at a sharp temperature and not over a temperature interval. Once we know the continuity of the first derivatives of the Gibbs free energy, we show that all the Ehrenfest equations are readily satisfied. We study the effect of the perturbation of the cosmological constant as well as the perturbation of the electric charge on thermodynamic stability of Hořava–Lifshitz black hole. We also use thermodynamic geometry to study phase transition in extended phase space. We investigate the behavior of scalar curvature of Weinhold, Ruppeiner, and Quevedo metric in extended phase space of charged Hořava–Lifshitz black holes. It is checked if these curvatures could reproduce the result of specific heat for the phase transition.
If one assumes a particular form of non-minimal coupling, called the conformal coupling, of a perfect fluid with gravity in the fluid–gravity Lagrangian then one gets modified Einstein field equation. In the modified Einstein equation the effect of the non-minimal coupling does not vanish if one works with spacetimes for which the Ricci scalar vanishes. In the present work we use the Schwarzschild metric in the modified Einstein equation, in the presence of non-minimal coupling with a fluid, and find out the energy–density and pressure of the fluid. In the present case the perfect fluid is part of the solution of the modified Einstein equation. We also solve the modified Einstein equation, using the flat spacetime metric and show that in the presence of non-minimal coupling one can accommodate a perfect fluid of uniform energy–density and pressure in the flat spacetime. In both the cases the fluid pressure turns out to be negative. Except these non-trivial solutions it must be noted that the vacuum solutions also remain as trivial valid solutions of the modified Einstein equation in the presence of non-minimal coupling.
An isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model with a source of dark energy is studied. That source is simulated with a viscous relativistic fluid with minimal causal correction. In this model the restrictions on the parameters coming from the following conditions are analized: (a) energy density without singularities along time, (b) scale factor increasing with time, (c) universe accelerated at present time, (d) state equation for dark energy with “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em>” bounded and close to −1. It is found that those conditions are satisfied for the following two cases. (i) When the transport coefficient (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\tau _{\Pi }\)</span>), associated to the causal correction, is negative, with the additional restriction <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\zeta \left| \tau _{\Pi }\right| &gt;2/3\)</span>, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\zeta \)</span> is the relativistic bulk viscosity coefficient. The state equation is in the “phantom” energy sector. (ii) For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\tau _{\Pi }\)</span> positive, in the “k-essence” sector. It is performed an exact calculation for the case where the equation of state is constant, finding that option (ii) is favored in relation to (i), because in (ii) the entropy is always increasing, while this does no happen in (i).
It is well known that in general theories of gravity with the diffeomorphism symmetry, the black hole entropy is a Noether charge. But what will happen if the symmetry is explicitly broken? By investigating the covariant first law of black hole mechanics with background fields, we show that the would-be Noether charge still can be identified as the black hole entropy, provided that it is a local quantity on the horizon. Moreover, motivated by the proposal that the cosmological constant behaves as a thermodynamic variable, we allow the non-dynamical background fields to be varied. To illustrate this general formalism, we study a generic static black brane in the massive gravity. Using the first law and the scaling argument, we obtain two Smarr formulas. We show that both of them can be retrieved without relying on the first law, hence providing a self-consistent check of the theory.
The scattering of spinning test particles by a Schwarzschild black hole is studied. The motion is described according to the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon model for extended bodies in a given gravitational background field. The equatorial plane is taken as the orbital plane, the spin vector being orthogonal to it with constant magnitude. The equations of motion are solved analytically in closed form to first-order in spin and the solution is used to compute corrections to the standard geodesic scattering angle as well as capture cross section by the black hole.
We present the derivation and the solutions to the coupled electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations with sources in a charged black hole background. We work in the so called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ghost gauge</em> and consider as source of the perturbations the infall of radial currents. In this way, we study a system in which it is provoked a response involving both, gravitational and electromagnetic waves, which allows us to analyze the dependence between them. We solve numerically the wave equations that describe both signals, characterize the waveforms and study the relation between the input parameters of the infalling matter with those of the gravitational and electromagnetic responses.
This work relates to the famous experiments, performed in 1975 and 1979 by Werner et al., measuring neutron interference and neutron Sagnac effects in the earth’s gravitational field. Employing the method of Stodolsky in its weak field approximation, explicit expressions are derived for the two phase shifts, which turn out to be in agreement with the experiments and with the previously obtained expressions derived from semi-classical arguments: these expressions are simply modified by relativistic correction factors.
We present a time-dependent solution of the Maxwell equations in the Einstein universe, whose electric and magnetic fields, as seen by the stationary observers, are aligned with the Clifford parallels of the 3-sphere <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(S^3\)</span>. The conformal equivalence between Minkowski’s spacetime and (a region of) the Einstein cylinder is then exploited in order to obtain a knotted, finite energy, radiating solution of the Maxwell equations in flat spacetime. We also discuss similar electromagnetic fields in expanding closed Friedmann models, and compute the matter content of such configurations.
The model is constructed to describe the Schwarzschild-like black hole enclosed in the dust cosmological background. It is an exact solution of Einstein equations for spherically symmetric dust distribution, and is a special case of Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi solutions. The motion of the test particle in the model is investigated in comoving coordinate frame. Observable velocity of the particle is found from geodesic equations. It is shown that chosen reference system does not allow to solve the problem of ’all or nothing’ behavior.
We study the thermodynamic stabilities of uncharged and charged black holes surrounded by quintessence (BHQ) by means of effective thermodynamic quantities. When the state parameter of quintessence <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\omega _q\)</span> is appropriately chosen, the structures of BHQ are something like that of black holes in de Sitter space. Constructing the effective first law of thermodynamics in two different ways, we can derive the effective thermodynamic quantities of BHQ. Especially, these effective thermodynamic quantities also satisfy Smarr-like formulae. It is found that the uncharged BHQ is always thermodynamically unstable due to negative heat capacity, while for the charged BHQ there are phase transitions of the second order. We also show that there are several differences on the thermodynamic properties and critical behaviors of BHQ between the two ways we employed.
Properties of particles in Kerr metric are compared with properties of particles in rotating coordinates in Minkowski space-time. It is shown that particles with negative and zero energies existing in the ergosphere of the rotating black hole also exist in the region out of the static limit in rotating coordinates in Minkowski space-time. Some similarities like the Penrose process and differences in both cases are analyzed.
A solution of Einstein’s vacuum field equations that describes a boosted Kerr black hole relative to an asymptotic Lorentz frame at future null infinity is derived. The solution has three parameters (mass, rotation and boost) and corresponds to the most general configuration that an astrophysical black hole must have; it reduces to the Kerr solution when the boost parameter is zero. In this solution the ergosphere is north-south asymmetric, with dominant lobes in the direction opposite to the boost. However the event horizon, the Cauchy horizon and the ring singularity—which are the core of the black hole structure—do not alter, being independent of the boost parameter. Possible consequences for astrophysical processes connected with Penrose processes in the asymmetric ergosphere are discussed.
This paper explores Noether and Noether gauge symmetries of anisotropic universe model in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) gravity. We consider two particular models of this gravity and evaluate their symmetry generators as well as associated conserved quantities. We also find exact solution by using cyclic variable and investigate its behavior via cosmological parameters. The behavior of cosmological parameters turns out to be consistent with recent observations which indicates accelerated expansion of the universe. Next we study Noether gauge symmetry and corresponding conserved quantities for both isotropic and anisotropic universe models. We conclude that symmetry generators and the associated conserved quantities appear in all cases.
An attempt is made in order to clarify the so called regular black holes issue. It is revisited that if one works within general relativity minimally coupled with non linear source, mainly of electromagnetic origin, and within a static spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric, there is still room for singular contribution to the black hole solution. A reconstruction method is proposed and several examples are discussed, including new ones. A possible way to obtain a non singular black hole is introduced, and in this case, several known examples are re-discussed, and new ones are provided.
We add a prescription to the Newman–Janis algorithm in order to use it as a means of finding new <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">extended</em> rotating black hole spacetimes from static spherically symmetric ones. Then, we apply the procedure to a quantum improved black hole spacetime coming from Quantum Einstein Gravity in order to get the maximally extended spacetime corresponding to a non-singular rotating black hole. We rigourously check for the existence of scalar curvature singularities in the quantum improved rotating spacetime and we show that it is devoid of them. We also analyze the horizons and causal structure of the rotating black hole and provide Penrose diagrams for the maximally extended spacetime.
In <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((2+1)\)</span>-dimensional AdS spacetime, we obtain new exact black hole solutions, including two different models (power parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(k=1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(k\ne 1\)</span>), in the Einstein–Power–Maxwell (EPM) theory with nonminimally coupled scalar field. For the charged hairy black hole with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(k\ne 1\)</span>, we find that the solution contains a curvature singularity at the origin and is nonconformally flat. The horizon structures are identified, which indicates the physically acceptable lower bound of mass in according to the existence of black hole solutions. Later, the null geodesic equations for photon around this charged hairy black hole are also discussed in detail.
Relativistic formulation of Helmholtz’s vorticity transport equation is presented on the basis of Maxwell-like version of Euler’s equation of motion. Entangled characteristics associated with vorticity flux conservation in a vortex tube and in a stream tube are displayed on basis of Greenberg’s theory of spacelike congruence of vortex lines and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(1+1+(2)\)</span> decomposition of the gradient of fluid’s 4-velocity. Vorticity flux surfaces are surfaces of revolution about the rotation axis and are rotating with fluid’s angular velocity due to gravitational isorotation in a stationary axisymmetric perfect fluid configuration. Fluid’s angular velocity, angular momentum per baryon, injection energy, and invariant rotational potential are constant on such vorticity flux surfaces. Gravitation causes distortion of coaxial cylindrical vorticity flux surfaces in the limit of post-Newtonian approximation. The rotation of the fluid with angular velocity relative to vorticity flux surfaces generates swirl which causes the stretching of material vortex lines being wrapped on vorticity flux surfaces. Fluid helicity which is conserved in the fluid’s rest frame does not remain conserved in a locally nonrotating frame because of the existence of swirl. Vortex lines are twist free in the absence of meridional circulations, but the twisting of spacetime due to dragging effect leads to the increase in vorticity flux in a vortex tube.
We consider the problem of constructing cosmological solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations that contain multiple charged black holes. By considering the field equations as a set of constraint and evolution equations, we construct exact initial data for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> charged black holes on a hypersphere. This corresponds to the maximum of expansion of a cosmological solution, and provides sufficient information for a unique evolution. We then consider the specific example of a universe that contains eight charged black holes, and show that the existence of non-zero electric charge reduces the scale of the cosmological region of the space. These solutions generalize the Majumdar–Papapetrou solutions away from the extremal limit of charged black holes, and provide what we believe to be some of the first relativistic calculations of the effects of electric charge on cosmological backreaction.
The paper aims to apply the complex octonion to explore the influence of the energy gradient on the Eötvös experiment, impacting the gravitational mass in the ultra-strong magnetic fields. Until now the Eötvös experiment has never been validated under the ultra-strong magnetic field. It is aggravating the existing serious qualms about the Eötvös experiment. According to the electromagnetic and gravitational theory described with the complex octonions, the ultra-strong magnetic field must result in a tiny variation of the gravitational mass. The magnetic field with the gradient distribution will generate the energy gradient. These influencing factors will exert an influence on the state of equilibrium in the Eötvös experiment. That is, the gravitational mass will depart from the inertial mass to a certain extent, in the ultra-strong magnetic fields. Only under exceptional circumstances, especially in the case of the weak field strength, the gravitational mass may be equal to the inertial mass approximately. The paper appeals intensely to validate the Eötvös experiment in the ultra-strong electromagnetic strengths. It is predicted that the physical property of gravitational mass will be distinct from that of inertial mass.
In the paper (Khugaev et al. in Phys Rev D94:064065. <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07118"><span class="RefSource">arXiv: 1603.07118</span></a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2016</a></span>), we have shown that for perfect fluid spheres the pressure isotropy equation for Buchdahl–Vaidya–Tikekar metric ansatz continues to have the same Gauss form in higher dimensions, and hence higher dimensional solutions could be obtained by redefining the space geometry characterizing Vaidya–Tikekar parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>. In this paper we extend this analysis to pure Lovelock gravity; i.e. a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\((2N+2)\)</span>-dimensional solution with a given <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(K_{2N+2}\)</span> can be taken over to higher <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional pure Lovelock solution with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(K_n=(K_{2N+2}-n+2N+2)/(n-2N-1)\)</span> where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> is degree of Lovelock action. This ansatz includes the uniform density Schwarzshild and the Finch–Skea models, and it is interesting that the two define the two ends of compactness, the former being the densest and while the latter rarest. All other models with this ansatz lie in between these two limiting distributions.
We model a radiating star undergoing dissipative gravitational collapse in the form of radial heat flux. The exterior of the collapsing star is described by the generalised Vaidya solution representing a mixture of null radiation and strings. Our model generalises previously known results of constant string density atmosphere to include inhomogeneities in the exterior spacetime. By utilising a causal heat transport equation of the Maxwell–Cattaneo form we show that relaxational effects are enhanced in the presence of inhomogeneities due to the string density.
In geometric inequalities ADM mass plays more fundamental role than the concept of quasi-local mass. This paper is to demonstrate that using the quasi-local mass some new insights can be acquired. In spherically symmetric spacetimes the Misner–Sharp mass and the concept of the Kodama vector field provides an ideal setting to the investigations of geometric inequalities. We applying the proposed new techniques to investigate the spacetimes containing black hole or cosmological horizons but we shall also apply them in context of normal bodies. Most of the previous investigations applied only the quasi-local charges and the area. Our main point is to include the quasi-local mass in the corresponding geometrical inequalities. This way we recover some known relations but new inequalities are also derived.
We provide an alternative interpretation of the quantum cosmic phantom models, in which the current acceleration of the universe is due to the existence of an entropy of entanglement. Subsequently, we study their stability as well as the emergence of gravitational waves.
The closure constraint is a central piece of the mathematics of loop quantum gravity. It encodes the gauge invariance of the spin network states of quantum geometry and provides them with a geometrical interpretation: each decorated vertex of a spin network is dual to a quantized polyhedron in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\mathbb R}^{3}\)</span>. For instance, a 4-valent vertex is interpreted as a tetrahedron determined by the four normal vectors of its faces. We develop a framework where the closure constraint is re-interpreted as a Bianchi identity, with the normals defined as holonomies around the polyhedron faces of a connection (constructed from the spinning geometry interpretation of twisted geometries). This allows us to define closure constraints for hyperbolic tetrahedra (living in the 3-hyperboloid of unit future-oriented spacelike vectors in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\({\mathbb R}^{3,1}\)</span>) in terms of normals living all in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathrm {SU}(2)\)</span> or in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathrm {SB}(2,{\mathbb C})\)</span>. The latter fits perfectly with the classical phase space developed for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>-deformed loop quantum gravity supposed to account for a non-vanishing cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span>. This allows the interpretation of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>-deformed twisted geometries as actual discrete hyperbolic triangulations for 4d quantum gravity.
In this work, we attempt to investigate the effect of minimal length on the thermodynamic properties of a polarized ideal gas. The modified electric field in three spatial dimensions based on the Kempf algebra is obtained. The modifications of the thermodynamic parameters of the polarized ideal gas such as the mean energy and entropy are found. Also, we obtain the polarization and dielectric constant in the presence of a minimal length. By considering the values of experimental characteristics, the upper bound on the deformation parameter is estimated.
In this paper, we investigate a class of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory of gravity for warm inflation. We present some models where the early-time acceleration is realized in the weak and in the strong dissipation regime. Cosmological perturbations are analyzed.
A correction to the Jeans stability criterion due to dissipation is established for the case of dilute high temperature gases. This effect is only relevant in the relativistic scenario and includes additional terms due to a density gradient driven heat flux, a non-vanishing bulk viscosity and the space-time dependent gravitational potential first order fluctuations. The result is obtained by thoroughly analyzing the exponentially growing modes present in the dynamics of density fluctuations in the linearized relativistic Navier–Stokes regime. The corrections to the corresponding Jeans mass and wavenumber are explicitly obtained and are compared to the non-relativistic and non-dissipative values using the transport coefficients obtained in the BGK approximation.
The aim of this paper is to utilize some geometric properties of the de Sitter kinematical group to specify the nature of the potential function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V\left( x^i\right) \)</span> intrinsic to the Klein–Gordon equation. For this purpose, in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>-dimensional space, the existence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\((n-1)-\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(n-\)</span> dimensional subalgebras are necessary to establish the functional forms of the potential function and study its invariant solutions. We demonstrate the use of other group features to construct other potentials of interest. The results are schematicaly displayed in tables.
We study the dynamics of the vacuum Bianchi IX model with timelike singularity and compare it with the dynamics of the Bianchi IX model with cosmological singularity. We show that differences in the signs of some terms in the set of equations specifying the dynamics of both spacetimes lead to significant differences in their properties.
We investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the generalized Proca theory which corresponds to the generalization of the shift-symmetric scalar–tensor Horndeski theory to the vector–tensor theory. Any solution obtained in this paper possesses a constant spacetime norm of the vector field, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(X:=-\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu \nu }A_\mu A_\nu =X_0=\mathrm{constant}\)</span>. The solutions in the theory with generalized quartic coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(G_4(X)\)</span> generalize the stealth Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild- (anti-) de Sitter solutions obtained in the theory with the nonminimal coupling to the Einstein tensor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(G^{\mu \nu } A_\mu A_\nu \)</span>. While in the vector–tensor theory with the coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(G^{\mu \nu }A_\mu A_\nu \)</span> the electric charge does not explicitly affect the spacetime geometry, in more general cases with nonzero <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(G_{4XX}(X_0)\ne 0\)</span> this property does not hold in general. The solutions in the theory with generalized cubic coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(G_3(X)\)</span> are given by the Schwarzschild- (anti-) de Sitter spacetime, where the dependence on <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(G_3(X)\)</span> does not appear in the metric function.
The bouncing evolution of an universe in Loop Quantum Cosmology can be described very well by a set of effective equations, involving a function sin <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>. Recently, we have generalised these effective equations to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((d + 1)\)</span> dimensions and to any function <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>). Depending on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>) in these models inspired by Loop Quantum Cosmology, a variety of cosmological evolutions are possible, singular as well as non singular. In this paper, we study them in detail. Among other things, we find that the scale factor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(a(t) \propto t^{ \frac{2 q}{(2 q - 1) (1 + w) d}}\)</span> for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(x) = x^q\)</span>, and find explicit Kasner-type solutions if <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(w = 2 q - 1 \)</span> also. A result which we find particularly fascinating is that, for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\)</span>, the evolution is non singular and the scale factor <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) grows exponentially at a rate set, not by a constant density, but by a quantum parameter related to the area quantum.
In this paper, we have considered flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric in the framework of perfect fluid models and modified <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>) gravity (where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> is the Gauss Bonnet invariant). Particularly, we have considered particular realistic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em>) configurations that could be used to cure finite-time future singularities arising in the late-time cosmic accelerating epochs. We have then developed the viability bounds of these models induced by weak and null energy conditions, by using the recent estimated numerical figures of the deceleration, Hubble, snap and jerk parameters.
In this paper, we consider the phase transition of black hole in power Maxwell invariant by means of Maxwell’s equal area law. First, we review and study the analogy of nonlinear charged black hole solutions with the Van der Waals gas–liquid system in the extended phase space, and obtain isothermal <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">v</em> diagram. Then, using the Maxwell’s equal area law we study the phase transition of AdS black hole with different temperatures. Finally, we extend the method to the black hole in the canonical (grand canonical) ensemble in which charge (potential) is fixed at infinity. Interestingly, we find the phase transition occurs in the both ensembles. We also study the effect of the parameters of the black hole on the two-phase coexistence. The results show that the black hole may go through a small-large phase transition similar to those of usual non-gravity thermodynamic systems.
We study the Dirac equation in a spacetime that represents the nonlinear superposition of the Schwarzschild solution to an external, stationary electromagnetic field. The set of equations representing the uncharged Dirac particle in the Newman–Penrose formalism is decoupled into a radial and an angular parts. We obtain exact analytical solutions of the angular equations. We manage to obtain the radial wave equations with effective potentials. Finally, we study the potentials by plotting them as a function of radial distance and examine the effect of the twisting parameter and the frequencies on the potentials.
We revisit the tunneling picture for the Hawking effect in light of the charged Nariai manifold, because this general relativistic solution, which displays two horizons, provides the bonus to allow the knowledge of exact solutions of the field equations. We first perform a revisitation of the tunneling ansatz in the framework of particle creation in external fields <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">à la</em> Nikishov, which corroborates the interpretation of the semiclassical emission rate <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\varGamma }_{emission}\)</span> as the conditional probability rate for the creation of a couple of particles from the vacuum. Then, particle creation associated with the Hawking effect on the Nariai manifold is calculated in two ways. On the one hand, we apply the Hamilton–Jacobi formalism for tunneling, in the case of a charged scalar field on the given background. On the other hand, the knowledge of the exact solutions for the Klein–Gordon equations on Nariai manifold, and their analytic properties on the extended manifold, allow us a direct computation of the flux of particles leaving the horizon, and, as a consequence, we obtain a further corroboration of the semiclassical tunneling picture from the side of S-matrix formalism.
The group of rigid motions is considered to guide the search for a natural system of space-time coordinates in General Relativity. This search leads us to a natural extension of the space-times that support Painlevé–Gullstrand synchronization. As an interesting example, here we describe a system of rigid coordinates for the cross mode of gravitational linear plane waves.
We implement a spatially fixed mesh refinement under spherical symmetry for the characteristic formulation of General Relativity. The Courant–Friedrich–Levy condition lets us deploy an adaptive resolution in (retarded-like) time, even for the nonlinear regime. As test cases, we replicate the main features of the gravitational critical behavior and the spacetime structure at null infinity using the Bondi mass and the News function. Additionally, we obtain the global energy conservation for an extreme situation, i.e. in the threshold of the black hole formation. In principle, the calibrated code can be used in conjunction with an ADM 3+1 code to confirm the critical behavior recently reported in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime. For the scenarios studied, the fixed mesh refinement offers improved runtime and results comparable to code without mesh refinement.
A nonrelativistic particle released from rest at the edge of a ball of uniform charge density or mass density oscillates with simple harmonic motion. We consider the relativistic generalizations of these situations where the particle can attain speeds arbitrarily close to the speed of light; generalizing the electrostatic and gravitational cases requires special and general relativity, respectively. We find exact closed-form relations between the position, proper time, and coordinate time in both cases, and find that they are no longer harmonic, with oscillation periods that depend on the amplitude. In the highly relativistic limit of both cases, the particle spends almost all of its proper time near the turning points, but almost all of the coordinate time moving through the bulk of the ball. Buchdahl’s theorem imposes nontrivial constraints on the general-relativistic case, as a ball of given density can only attain a finite maximum radius before collapsing into a black hole. This article is intended to be pedagogical, and should be accessible to those who have taken an undergraduate course in general relativity.
We analyze numerically the behaviour of the solutions corresponding to an Abelian cosmic string taking into account an extension of the Starobinsky model, where the action of general relativity is replaced by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(R) = R - 2\Lambda + \eta R^2 + \rho R^m\)</span>, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(m &gt; 2\)</span>. As an interesting result, we find that the angular deficit which characterizes the cosmic string decreases as the parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\eta \)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\rho \)</span> increase. We also find that the cosmic horizon due to the presence of a cosmological constant is affected in such a way that it can grows or shrinks, depending on the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field and on the value of the cosmological constant.
We investigate noninertial effects on the scattering problem of a nonrelativistic particle in the cosmic string spacetime. By considering the nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation we are able to show, in the regime of small rotational frequencies, that the phase shift has two contribution: one related to the noninertial reference frame, and the other, due to the cosmic string conical topology. We also show that both the incident wave and the scattering amplitude are altered as a consequence of the noninertial reference frame and depend on the rotational frequency.
In the present paper we investigate tachyonic chameleon scalar field and present the phase space analysis for four different combinations of the tachyonic potential <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(V(\phi )\)</span> and the coupling function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(\phi )\)</span> of the chameleon field with matter. We find some stable solution in which accelerated expansion of the universe is satisfied. In one case where both <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(f(\phi )\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(V(\phi )\)</span> are exponential a scaling attractor was found that can give rise to the late-time acceleration of the universe and alleviate the coincidence problem.
We point out (and then apply to a general situation) an unusual relationship among a variety of null geodesic congruences; (a) the generators of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ordinary light-cones and</em> (b) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">certain (related) shear-free but twisting congruences in Minkowski space–time as well as</em> (c) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">asymptotically shear-free</em> null geodesic congruences that exist in the neighborhood of Penrose’s <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(I^{ +}\)</span> in Einstein or Einstein–Maxwell asymptotically flat-space–times. We refer to these geodesic congruences respectively as: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Lignt-Cones (LCs), as “Almost-Complex”-Light-Cones</em> (ACLCs), [though they are real they resemble complex light-cones in complex Minkowski space] and finally to a family of congruences in asymptotically flat-spaces as ‘<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Almost Light-Cones</em>’ (ALC). The two essential points of resemblance among the three families are: (1) they are all either shear-free or asymptotically shear-free and (2) in each family the individual members of the family can be labeled by the points in a real or complex four-dimensional manifold. As an example, the Minkowski space LCs are labeled by the (real) coordinate value of their apex. In the case of (ACLCs) (complex coordinate values), the congruences will have non-vanishing twist whose magnitude is determined by the imaginary part of the complex coordinate values. In studies of gravitational radiation, Bondi-type of null surfaces and their associated Bondi coordinates have been almost exclusively used for calculations. It turns out that some surprising relations arise if, instead of the Bondi coordinates, one uses ALCs and their associated coordinate systems in the analysis of the Einstein–Maxwell equations in the neighborhood of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(I^{+}\)</span>. More explicitly and surprisingly, the asymptotic Bianchi Identities (arising directly from the Einstein equations), expressed in the coordinates of the ALCs, turn directly into many of the standard definitions and equations and relations of classical mechanics coupled with Maxwell’s equations. These results extend and generalize the beautiful results of Bondi and Sachs with their expressions for, and loss of, mass and linear momentum.
We establish the result that the standard Boulware–Deser spacetime can radiate. This allows us to model the dynamics of a spherically symmetric radiating dynamical star in five-dimensional Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity with three spacetime regions. The local internal region is a two-component system consisting of standard pressure-free, null radiation and an additional string fluid with energy density and nonzero pressure obeying all physically realistic energy conditions. The middle region is purely radiative which matches to a third region which is the vacuum Boulware–Deser exterior. Our approach allows for all three spacetime regions to be modeled by the same class of metric functions. A large family of solutions to the field equations are presented for various realistic equations of state. A comparison of our solutions with earlier well known results is undertaken and we show that Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet analogues of these solutions, including those of Husain, are contained in our family. We also generalise our results to higher dimensions.
We show that in Oeckl’s boundary formalism the boundary vectors that do not have a tensor form represent, in a precise sense, statistical states. Therefore the formalism incorporates quantum statistical mechanics naturally. We formulate general-covariant quantum statistical mechanics in this language. We illustrate the formalism by showing how it accounts for the Unruh effect. We observe that the distinction between pure and mixed states weakens in the general covariant context, suggesting that local gravitational processes are naturally statistical without a sharp quantal versus probabilistic distinction.
The recent LIGO observation sparked interest in the field of gravitational wave signals. Besides the gravitational wave observation the LIGO collaboration used the inspiraling black hole pair to constrain the graviton mass. Unlike general relativity, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories have a characteristic non-zero mass graviton. We apply this constraint on the graviton mass to viable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) models in order to find the effects on model parameters. We find it possible to constrain the parameter space with these gravity wave based observations. We consider the popular Hu–Sawicki model as a case study and find an appropriate parameter bracket. The result generalizes to other <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theories and can be used to constrain the parameter space.
We use the notion of intrinsic flat distance to address the almost rigidity of the positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. In particular, we prove that a sequence of spherically symmetric asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds satisfying the conditions of the positive mass theorem converges to hyperbolic space in the intrinsic flat sense, if the limit of the mass along the sequence is zero.
In this article, we present a bouncing cosmology inspired by a family of regular black holes. This scale-dependent cosmology deviates from the cosmological principle by means of a scale factor which depends on the time and the radial coordinate as well. The model is isotropic but not perfectly homogeneous. That is, this cosmology describes a universe almost homogeneous only for large scales, such as our observable universe.
We use a direct numerical integration of the Vlasov equation in spherical symmetry with a background gravitational potential to determine the evolution of a collection of particles in different models of a galactic halo in order to test its stability against perturbations. Such collection is assumed to represent a dark matter inhomogeneity which is represented by a distribution function defined in phase-space. Non-trivial stationary states are obtained and determined by the virialization of the system. We describe some features of these stationary states by means of the properties of the final distribution function and final density profile. We compare our results using the different halo models and find that the NFW halo model is the most stable of them, in the sense that an inhomogeneity in this halo model requires a shorter time to virialize.
Somewhat surprisingly, in many of the widely used monographs and review articles the term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Transverse-Traceless modes</em> of linearized gravitational waves is used to denote two entirely different notions. These treatments generally begin with a decomposition of the metric perturbation that is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">local in the momentum space</em> (and hence non-local in physical space), and denote the resulting transverse traceless modes by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(h_{ab}^{\mathrm{TT}}\)</span>. However, while discussing gravitational waves emitted by an isolated system—typically in a later section—the relevant modes are extracted using a ‘projection operator’ that is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">local in physical space</em>. These modes are also called transverse-traceless and again labeled <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(h_{ab}^{\mathrm{TT}}\)</span>, implying that this is just a reformulation of the previous notion. But the two notions are conceptually distinct and the difference persists even in the asymptotic region. We show that this confusion arises already in Maxwell theory that is often discussed as a prelude to the gravitational case. Finally, we discuss why the distinction has nonetheless remained largely unnoticed, and also point out that there are some important physical effects where only one of the notions gives the correct answer.
We present a novel derivation of the boundary term for the action in Lanczos–Lovelock gravity, starting from the boundary contribution in the variation of the Lanczos–Lovelock action. The derivation presented here is straightforward, i.e., one starts from the Lanczos–Lovelock action principle and the action <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">itself</em> dictates the boundary structure and hence the boundary term one needs to add to the action to make it well-posed. It also gives the full structure of the contribution at the boundary of the complete action, enabling us to read off the degrees of freedom to be fixed at the boundary, their corresponding conjugate momenta and the total derivative contribution on the boundary. We also provide a separate derivation of the Gauss–Bonnet case.
In this letter, cosmology of a simple NMDC gravity with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\xi R \phi _{,\mu }\phi ^{,\mu }\)</span> term and a free kinetic term is considered in flat geometry and in presence of dust matter. A logarithm field transformation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\phi ' = \mu \ln \phi \)</span> is proposed phenomenologically. Assuming slow-roll approximation, equation of motion, scalar field solution and potential are derived as function of kinematic variables. The field solution and potential are found straightforwardly for power-law, de-Sitter and super-acceleration expansions. Slow-roll parameters and slow-roll condition are found to depend on more than one variable. At large field the re-scaling effect can enhance the acceleration. For slow-rolling field, the negative coupling <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\xi \)</span> could enhance the effect of acceleration.
We consider collision of two massive particles in the equatorial plane of an axially symmetric stationary spacetime that produces two massless particles afterwards. It is implied that the horizon is absent but there is a naked singularity or another potential barrier that makes possible the head-on collision. The relationship between the energy in the center of mass frame <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span> and the Killing energy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> measured at infinity is analyzed. It follows immediately from the Wald inequalities that unbounded <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em> is possible for unbounded <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span> only. This can be realized if the spacetime is close to the threshold of the horizon formation. Different types of spacetimes (black holes, naked singularities, wormholes) correspond to different possible relations between <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(E_{c.m.}\)</span> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">E</em>. We develop a general approach that enables us to describe the collision process in the frames of the stationary observer and zero angular momentum observer. The escape cone and escape fraction are derived. A simple explanation of the existence of the bright spot is given. For the particular case of the Kerr metric, our results agree with the previous ones found in Patil et al. (Phys Rev D 93:104015, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18">2016</a></span>).
The main goal of the present work is to analyze the cosmological scenario of the induced gravity theory developed in previous works. Such a theory consists on a Yang–Mills theory in a four-dimensional Euclidian spacetime with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({ SO}(m,n)\)</span> such that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(m+n=5\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(m\in \{0,1,2\}\)</span> as its gauge group. This theory undergoes a dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via an Inönü–Wigner contraction in its infrared sector. As a consequence, the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({ SO}(m,n)\)</span> algebra is deformed into a Lorentz algebra with the emergency of the local Lorentz symmetries and the gauge fields being identified with a vierbein and a spin connection. As a result, gravity is described as an effective Einstein–Cartan-like theory with ultraviolet correction terms and a propagating torsion field. We show that the cosmological model associated with this effective theory has three different regimes. In particular, the high curvature regime presents a de Sitter phase which tends towards a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model. We argue that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\({ SO}(m,n)\)</span> induced gravities are promising effective theories to describe the early phase of the universe.
We show that the low frequency absorption cross section of minimally coupled test massless scalar fields by extremal spherically symmetric black holes in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> dimensions is equal to the horizon area, even in the presence of string-theoretical <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha '\)</span> corrections. Classically one has the relation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\sigma = 4 GS\)</span> between that absorption cross section and the black hole entropy. By comparing in each case the values of the horizon area and Wald’s entropy, we discuss the validity of such relation in the presence of higher derivative corrections for extremal black holes in many different contexts: in the presence of electric and magnetic charges; for nonsupersymmetric and supersymmetric black holes; in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(d=4\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(d=5\)</span> dimensions. The examples we consider seem to indicate that this relation is not verified in the presence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\alpha '\)</span> corrections in general, although being valid in some specific cases (electrically charged maximally supersymmetric black holes in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(d=5\)</span>). We argue that the relation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\sigma = 4 GS\)</span> should in general be valid for the absorption cross section of scalar fields which, although being independent from the black hole solution, have their origin from string theory, and therefore are not minimally coupled.
We study gravitational collapse with anisotropic pressures, whose end stage can mimic space–times that are seeded by galactic dark matter. To this end, we identify a class of space–times (with conical defects) that can arise out of such a collapse process, and admit stable circular orbits at all radial distances. These have a naked singularity at the origin. An example of such a space–time is seen to be the Bertrand space–time discovered by Perlick, that admits closed, stable orbits at all radii. Using relativistic two-fluid models, we show that our galactic space–times might indicate exotic matter, i.e one of the component fluids may have negative pressure for a certain asymptotic fall off of the associated mass density, in the Newtonian limit. We complement this analysis by studying some simple examples of Newtonian two-fluid systems, and compare this with the Newtonian limit of the relativistic systems considered.
We construct solutions of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to nonlinear <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\sigma \)</span>-model with cosmological constant. The <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\sigma \)</span>-model can be perceived as exterior configuration of a spontaneously-broken <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(SO(D-1)\)</span> global higher-codimensional “monopole”. Here we allow the kinetic term of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\sigma \)</span>-model to be noncanonical; in particular we specifically study a quadratic-power-law type. This is some possible higher-dimensional generalization of the Bariola–Vilenkin (BV) solutions with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>-global monopole studied recently. The solutions can be perceived as the exterior solution of a black hole swallowing up noncanonical global defects. Even in the absence of comological constant its surrounding spacetime is asymptotically non-flat; it suffers from deficit solid angle. We discuss the corresponding horizons. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda &gt;0\)</span> in 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> there can exist three extremal conditions (the cold, ultracold, and Nariai black holes), while in higher-than-four dimensions the extremal black hole is only Nariai. For <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\Lambda &lt;0\)</span> we only have black hole solutions with one horizon, save for the 4<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> case where there can exist two horizons. We give constraints on the mass and the symmetry-breaking scale for the existence of all the extremal cases. In addition, we also obtain factorized solutions, whose topology is the direct product of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(M_2\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(dS_2\)</span>, or <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(AdS_2\)</span>) with (D-2)-sphere. We study all possible factorized channels.
The Ashtekar and Ashtekar–Barbero connection variable formulations of Kerr isolated horizons are derived. Using a regular Kinnersley tetrad in horizon-penetrating Kruskal–Szekeres-like coordinates, the spin coefficients of Kerr geometry are determined by solving the first Maurer–Cartan equation of structure. Isolated horizon conditions are imposed on the tetrad and the spin coefficients. A transformation into an orthonormal tetrad frame that is fixed in the time gauge is applied and explicit calculations of the spin connection, the Ashtekar and Ashtekar–Barbero connections, and the corresponding curvatures on the horizon 2-spheres are performed. Since the resulting Ashtekar–Barbero curvature does not comply with the simple form of the horizon boundary condition of Schwarzschild isolated horizons, i.e., on the horizon 2-spheres, the Ashtekar–Barbero curvature is not proportional to the Plebanski 2-form, which is required for an SU(2) Chern–Simons treatment of the gauge degrees of freedom in the horizon boundary in the context of loop quantum gravity, a general method to construct a new connection whose curvature satisfies such a relation for Kerr isolated horizons is introduced. For the purpose of illustration, this method is employed in the framework of slowly rotating Kerr isolated horizons.
We obtain an approximate global stationary and axisymmetric solution of Einstein’s equations which can be thought of as a simple star model: a self-gravitating perfect fluid ball with a differential rotation motion pattern. Using the post-Minkowskian formalism (weak-field approximation) and considering rotation as a perturbation (slow-rotation approximation), we find approximate interior and exterior (asymptotically flat) solutions to this problem in harmonic coordinates. Interior and exterior solutions are matched, in the sense described by Lichnerowicz, on the surface of zero pressure, to obtain a global solution. The resulting metric depends on four arbitrary constants: mass density; rotational velocity at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r=0\)</span>; a parameter that accounts for the change in rotational velocity through the star; and the star radius in the non-rotation limit. The mass, angular momentum, quadrupole moment and other constants of the exterior metric are determined in terms of these four parameters.
What have become known as the “Darmois” and “Lichnerowicz” junction conditions are often stated to be equivalent, “essentially” equivalent, in a “sense” equivalent, and so on. One even sees not infrequent reference to the “Darmois–Lichnerowicz” conditions. Whereas the equivalence of these conditions is manifest in Gaussian-normal coordinates, a fact that has been known for close to a century, this equivalence does not extend to a loose definition of “admissible” coordinates (coordinates in which the metric and its first order derivatives are continuous). We show this here by way of a simple, but physically relevant, example. In general, a loose definition of the “Lichnerowicz” conditions gives additional restrictions, some of which simply amount to a convenient choice of gauge, and some of which amount to real physical restrictions, away from strict “admissible” coordinates. The situation was totally confused by a very influential, and now frequently misquoted, paper by Bonnor and Vickers, that erroneously claimed a proof of the equivalence of the “Darmois” and “Lichnerowicz” conditions within this loose definition of “admissible” coordinates. A correct proof, based on a strict definition of “admissible” coordinates, was given years previous by Israel. It is that proof, generally unrecognized, that we must refer to. Attention here is given to a clarification of the subject, and to the history of the subject, which, it turns out, is rather fascinating in itself.
Conjugate points play an important role in the proofs of the singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose. We examine the relation between singularities and conjugate points in FLRW spacetimes with a singularity. In particular we prove a theorem that when a non-comoving, non-spacelike geodesic in a singular FLRW spacetime obeys conditions (<span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Equ39">39</a></span>) and (<span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Equ40">40</a></span>), every point on that geodesic is part of a pair of conjugate points. The proof is based on the Raychaudhuri equation. We find that the theorem is applicable to all non-comoving, non-spacelike geodesics in FLRW spacetimes with non-negative spatial curvature and scale factors that near the singularity have power law behavior or power law behavior times a logarithm. When the spatial curvature is negative, the theorem is applicable to a subset of these spacetimes.
The nonprojectable Hořava theory at the kinetic-conformal point is defined by setting a specific value of the coupling constant of the kinetic term of the Lagrangian. This formulation has two additional second class-constraints that eliminate the extra mode. We show that the space of solutions of this theory in the Hamiltonian formalism is bigger than the space of solutions in the original Lagrangian formalism. In the Hamiltonian formalism there are certain configurations for the Lagrange multipliers that lead to solutions that cannot be found in the original Lagrangian formulation. We show specific examples in vacuum and with a source. The solution with the source has homogeneous and isotropic spatial hypersurfaces. The enhancement of the space of solutions leaves the possibility that new solutions applicable to cosmology, or to other physical systems, can be found in the Hamiltonian formalism.
The dynamical process of magnetic flux variation in a fluid’s stream tube is described by constructing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(1+1+ (2)\)</span> decomposition of the gradient of fluid’s 4-velocity. The necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for a spacelike congruence to be a congruence of rigidly connected spacelike curves. The evolution of magnetic flux in a magnetic tube is explored under the assumptions that magnetic lines are rigidly connected and the chemical potential of the fluid is constant along a magnetic tube. The interplay between magnetic and stream tubes is demonstrated. It is shown that the growth of magnetic energy in a magnetic tube cannot exceed to that of a stream tube. It is found that the proper time variation of twist of magnetic lines is caused by gravitation inside a neutron star if magnetic lines are rigidly connected and charge neutrality condition holds. Helmholtz-like magnetic vorticity flux conservation in a magnetic tube constituted by rigidly connected geodetic magnetic lines is derived under the assumption that the charge neutrality condition holds. It is shown that the winding of frozen-in poloidal magnetic field due to differential rotation requires meridional circulation in an axisymmetric stationary hydromagnetic configuration.
We provide some “half-space theorems” for spacelike complete non-compact hypersurfaces into orthogonally splitted spacetimes. In particular we generalize some recent work of Rubio and Salamanca on maximal spacelike compact hypersurfaces. Beside compactness, we also relax some of their curvature assumptions and even consider the case of nonconstant mean curvature bounded from above. The analytic tools used in various arguments are based on some forms of the weak maximum principle.
We obtain new simple sufficient conditions to ensure the stability and strong stability of maximal hypersurfaces (without boundary) immersed in an arbitrary spacetime. Several applications to maximal hypersurfaces in a spatially open or closed spacetime endowed with an infinitesimal causal symmetry are also given.
In this paper, we use the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and quantum tunneling method to research the formation of the remnant from a Schwarzschild black hole with global monopole. Based on the corrected Hamilton–Jacobi equation, the corrections to the Hawking temperature, heat capacity and entropy are calculated. We not only find the remnant close to Planck scale by employing GUP, but also research the thermodynamic stability of the black hole remnant according to the phase transition and heat capacity.
One of the problems in the catalogue of solutions to the vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations is the dearth of solutions to what is known as the type N twisting metric. Were it to be found in its general form it would then, according to the Peeling theorem of Sachs (Proc R Soc Lond A270:103, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7">1962</a></span>), describe the asymptotic gravitational field of an isolated source. The only known mathematical solution was found by Hauser (Phys Rev Lett 33:1112, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1974</a></span>) and (Phys Rev Lett 33:1525, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">1974</a></span>). In this article the general equations are reduced to one third order complex equation for one complex variable plus one simple condition.
The present work is intended to gain a fruitful insight into the understanding of the formations of magneto-vortex configurations and their role in the physical processes of mutual exchange of energies associated with fluid’s motion and the magnetic fields in an axisymmetric stationary hydromagnetic system subject to strong gravitational field (e.g., neutron star/magnetar). It is found that the vorticity flux vector field associated with vorticity 2-form is a linear combination of fluid’s vorticity vector and of magnetic vorticity vector. The vorticity flux vector obeys Helmholtz’s flux conservation. The energy equation associated with the vorticity flux vector field is deduced. It is shown that the mechanical rotation of vorticity flux surfaces contributes to the formation of vorticity flux vector field. The dynamo action for the generation of toroidal components of vorticity flux vector field is described in the presence of meridional circulations. It is shown that the stretching of twisting magnetic lines due to differential rotation leads to the breakdown of gravitational isorotation in the absence of meridional circulations. An explicit expression consists of rotation of vorticity flux surface, energy and angular momentum per baryon for the fluid-magnetic helicity current vector is obtained. The conservation of fluid-magnetic helicity is demonstrated. It is found that the fluid-magnetic helicity displays the energy spectrum arising due to the interaction between the mechanical rotation of vorticity flux surfaces and the fluid’s motion obeying Euler’s equations. The dissipation of a linear combination of modified fluid helicity and magnetic twist is shown to occur due to coupled effect of frame dragging and meridional circulation. It is found that the growing twist of magnetic lines causes the dissipation of modified fluid helicity in the absence of meridional circulations.
Brans–Dicke gravity admits spherical solutions describing naked singularities rather than black holes. Depending on some parameters entering such a solution, stable circular orbits exist for all radii. One shows that, despite the fact a naked singularity is an infinite redshift location, the far observed orbital motion frequency is unbounded for an adiabatically decreasing radius. We then argue that this feature remains true in a wide set of scalar(s)–tensor theories if gravity. This is a salient difference with general relativity, and the repercussion on the gravitational radiation by EMRI systems is stressed. Since this behaviour survives the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\omega \longrightarrow \infty \)</span> limit, the possibility of such solutions is of utmost interest in the new gravitational wave astronomy context, despite the current constraints on scalar–tensor gravity.
In this work, we examine the effects of the cosmological constant and a scalar field on the angle of deflection of null geodesics in the equatorial plane of the Dilaton-de Sitter space–time. We employ the Rindler–Ishak method to compute the gravitational lensing. We derive new limits on the value of the cosmological constant, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span>, based on the bending of light by systems where the lens is a distant galaxy or a cluster of galaxies. These results are essential and important for studies of cosmology.
We propose a model-independent formalism to numerically solve the modified Friedmann equations in the framework of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) teleparallel cosmology. Our strategy is to expand the Hubble parameter around the redshift <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(z=0\)</span> up to a given order and to adopt cosmographic bounds as initial settings to determine the corresponding <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f(z)\equiv f(T(H(z)))\)</span> function. In this perspective, we distinguish two cases: the first expansion is up to the jerk parameter, the second expansion is up to the snap parameter. We show that inside the observed redshift domain <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(z\le 1\)</span>, only the net strength of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>) is modified passing from jerk to snap, whereas its functional behavior and shape turn out to be identical. As first step, we set the cosmographic parameters by means of the most recent observations. Afterwards, we calibrate our numerical solutions with the concordance <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM model. In both cases, there is a good agreement with the cosmological standard model around <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(z\le 1\)</span>, with severe discrepancies outer of this limit. We demonstrate that the effective dark energy term evolves following the test-function: <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(f(z)={\mathcal {A}}+{\mathcal {B}}{z}^2e^{{\mathcal {C}}{z}}\)</span>. Bounds over the set <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\left\{ {\mathcal {A}}, {\mathcal {B}}, {\mathcal {C}}\right\} \)</span> are also fixed by statistical considerations, comparing discrepancies between <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>) with data. The approach opens the possibility to get a wide class of test-functions able to frame the dynamics of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) without postulating any model <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a priori</em>. We thus re-obtain the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) function through a back-scattering procedure once <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>) is known. We figure out the properties of our <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) function at the level of background cosmology, to check the goodness of our numerical results. Finally, a comparison with previous cosmographic approaches is carried out giving results compatible with theoretical expectations.
Scalar, vector and tensor harmonics on the three-sphere were introduced originally to facilitate the study of various problems in gravitational physics. These harmonics are defined as eigenfunctions of the covariant Laplace operator which satisfy certain divergence and trace identities, and ortho-normality conditions. This paper provides a summary of these properties, along with a new notation that simplifies and clarifies some of the key expressions. Practical methods are described for accurately and efficiently computing these harmonics numerically, and test results are given that illustrate how well the analytical identities are satisfied by the harmonics computed numerically in this way.
The Poincaré invariance of GR is usually interpreted as Lorentz invariance plus diffeomorphism invariance. In this paper, by introducing the local inertial coordinates (LIC), it is shown that a theory with Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance is not necessarily Poincaré invariant. Actually, the energy–momentum conservation is violated there. On the other hand, with the help of the LIC, the Poincaré invariance is reinterpreted as an internal symmetry. In this formalism, the conservation law is derived, which has not been sufficiently explored before.
In nonlinear electrodynamics a photon does not follow null geodesics of background geometry, but moves along null geodesics of a corresponding effective geometry. Therefore, in the strong deflection limit, in order to study the gravitational lensing of the regular electrically charged black holes obtained by coupling general relativity to nonlinear electrodynamics, one should firstly obtain the corresponding effective geometry, which is a necessary and key step. I obtain the deflection angle of the photon in the strong deflection limit, and further calculate the angular position and magnification of relativistic images. It is found that, the electric charge has significant effect on the gravitational lensing of regular black holes. With the increase of the electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>, the angular position of the relativistic images <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\theta _{\infty }\)</span> and the relative magnification <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal {R}_{m}\)</span> as a function of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> decrease, while the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the others <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal {S}\)</span> as a function of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em> increases. I also discuss the measurement of observables for the black hole at the center of our Galaxy in the cases of regular electrically charged black hole effective metrics.
In this work the homogeneous and isotropic Universe of Friedmann–Robertson–Walker is studied in the presence of two fluids: stiff matter and radiation described by the Schutz’s formalism. We obtain to the classic case the behaviour of the scale factor of the universe. For the quantum case the wave packets are constructed and the wave function of the universe is found.
Using a perturbative method, we investigate solutions of the Klein–Gordon equations for a charged massive field in the background of a magnetar, both in the interior solution and outside the star. A special attention is given to cases where the variables can be separated and the wave function is expressed in terms of the Heun’s general or confluent functions. By imposing various conditions on the parameters, one gets the energy quantization law and simple polynomial forms of the Heun’s functions, which can be used in computing first-order transition amplitudes.
Recently Pikovski et al. (Nat Phys 11:668, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2015</a></span>) have proposed in an intriguing universal decoherence mechanism, suggesting that gravitation may play a conceptually important role in the quantum-to-classical transition, albeit vanishingly small in everyday situations. Here we analyze information transfer induced by this mechanism. We show that generically on short time-scales, gravitational decoherence leads to a redundant information encoding, which results in a form of objectivization of the center-of-mass position in the gravitational field. We derive the relevant time-scales of this process, given in terms of energy dispersion and quantum Fisher information. As an example we study thermal coherent states and show certain robustness of the effect with the temperature. Finally, we draw an analogy between our objectivization mechanism and the fundamental problem of point individuation in General Relativity as emphasized by the Einstein’s Hole argument.
Position determination of photon emitters and associated strong field parallax effects are investigated using relativistic optics when the photon orbits are confined to the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We assume the emitter is at a fixed space position and the receiver moves along a circular geodesic orbit. This study requires solving the inverse problem of determining the (spatial) intersection point of two null geodesic initial data problems, serving as a simplified model for applications in relativistic astrometry as well as in radar and satellite communications.
In this paper, we obtain luminosity distances by using ages of 32 old passive galaxies distributed over the redshift interval <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(0.11&lt; z &lt; 1.84\)</span> and test the cosmic conservation of photon number by comparing them with 580 distance moduli of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the so-called Union 2.1 compilation. Our analyses are based on the fact that the method of obtaining ages of galaxies relies on the detailed shape of galaxy spectra but not on galaxy luminosity. Possible departures from cosmic conservation of photon number is parametrized by <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\tau (z) = 2 \upvarepsilon z\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\tau (z) = \upvarepsilon z/(1+z)\)</span> (for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\upvarepsilon =0\)</span> the conservation of photon number is recovered). We find <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\upvarepsilon =0.016^{+0.078}_{-0.075}\)</span> from the first parametrization and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\upvarepsilon =-\,0.18^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\)</span> from the second parametrization, both limits at 95% c.l. In this way, no significant departure from cosmic conservation of photon number is verified. In addition, by considering the total age as inferred from Planck (2015) analysis, we find the incubation time <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(t_{inc}=1.66\pm 0.29\)</span> Gyr and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(t_{inc}=1.23\pm 0.27\)</span> Gyr at 68% c.l. for each parametrization, respectively.
We show that higher curvature order gravities, in particular the propagating quadratic curvature models, cannot be derived by self-coupling from their linear, flat space, forms, except through an unphysical version of linearization; only GR can. Separately, we comment on an early version of the self-coupling bootstrap.
We study the geometrothermodynamics of a special asymptotically AdS black hole, i.e. Van der Waals <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\left( VdW\right) \)</span> black hole, in the extended phase space where the negative cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span> can be regarded as thermodynamic pressure. Analysing some special conditions of this black hole with geometrothermodynamical method, we find a good correlation with ordinary cases according to the state equation.
Recent released Planck data and other astronomical observations show that the universe may be anisotropic on large scales. This hints a cosmological privileged axis in our anisotropic expanding universe. This paper proceeds a modified redshift in anisotropic cosmological model as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\( 1+\tilde{z}(t,\hat{\mathbf{p }})=\frac{a(t_{0)}}{a(t)}(1-A(\hat{\mathbf{n }}.\hat{\mathbf{p }}))\)</span> (where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> is the magnitude of anisotropy, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\hat{\mathbf{n }}\)</span> is the direction of privileged axis, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\hat{\mathbf{p }}\)</span> is the direction of each SNe Ia sample to galactic coordinates) along with anisotropic parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\delta =\frac{A(\hat{\mathbf{n }}.\hat{\mathbf{p }})}{1+A(\hat{\mathbf{n }}.\hat{\mathbf{p }})}\)</span>. The luminosity distance is expanded with model-independent cosmographic parameters as a function of modified redshift <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\tilde{z}\)</span>. As the transformation matrix <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(M(n\times n)\)</span> is obtained to convert the Taylor series coefficients of isotropic luminosity distance to corresponding anisotropic parameters. These results culminate the magnitude of anisotropy about <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\mid A\mid \simeq 10^{-3}\)</span> and the direction of preferred axis as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\((l,b)=\left( 297^{-34}_{+34},3^{-28}_{+28}\right) \)</span>, which are consistent with other studies in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(1-\sigma \)</span> confidence level.
We investigate black holes with toroidal horizons in (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(d+1\)</span>)-dimensional space-time. Using the solution phase space method, we calculated conserved charges for these black holes before exploring some features of this metric including its entropy and thermodynamic quantities. Another aspect of the study involves obtaining a general exact static interior solution for uncharged black holes with toroidal horizons in (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(d+1\)</span>)-dimensional space-time. Finally, an interior solution for charged black holes is obtained.
Recently, the idea that gravity is emergent has attract many people’s attention. The “Emergent Gravity Paradigm” is a program that develop this idea from the thermodynamical point of view. It expresses the Einstein equation in the language of thermodynamics. A key equation in this paradigm is the holographic equipartition which says that, in all static spacetimes, the degrees of freedom on the boundary equal those in the bulk. And the time evolution of spacetime is drove by the departure from the holographic equipartition. In this paper, we get the holographic equipartition and its generalization from the first order formalism, that is, the connection and its conjugate momentum are considered to be the canonical variables. The final results have similar structure as those from the metric formalism. It gives another proof of holographic equipartition.
In this paper, we consider higher order corrections of the entropy, which coming from thermal fluctuations, and find their effect on the thermodynamics of higher dimensional charged black holes. Leading order thermal fluctuation is logarithmic term in the entropy while higher order correction is proportional to the inverse of original entropy. We calculate some thermodynamics quantities and obtain the effect of logarithmic and higher order corrections of entropy on them. Validity of the first law of thermodynamics investigated and Van der Waals equation of state of dual picture studied. We find that five-dimensional black hole behaves as Van der Waals, but higher dimensional case have not such behavior. We find that thermal fluctuations are important in stability of black hole hence affect unstable/stable black hole phase transition.
The Hawking–Penrose singularity theorem states that a singularity forms inside a black hole in general relativity. To remove this singularity one must resort to a more fundamental theory. Using a corrected dynamical equation arising in loop quantum cosmology and braneworld models, we study the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid sphere with a rather general equation of state. In the frame of an observer comoving with this fluid, the sphere pulsates between a maximum and a minimum size, avoiding the singularity. The exterior geometry is also constructed. There are usually an outer and an inner apparent horizon, resembling the Reissner–Nordström situation. For a distant observer the horizon crossing occurs in an infinite time and the pulsations of the black hole quantum “beating heart” are completely unobservable. However, it may be observable if the black hole is not spherical symmetric and radiates gravitational wave due to the quadrupole moment, if any.
We consider a particle falling into a rotating black hole. Such a particle makes an infinite number of revolutions <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> from the viewpoint of a remote observer who uses the Boyer–Lindquist type of coordinates. We examine the behavior of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> when it is measured with respect to a local reference frame that also rotates due to dragging effect of spacetime. The crucial point consists here in the observation that for a nonextremal black hole, the leading contributions to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> from a particle itself and the reference frame have the same form being in fact universal, so that divergences mutually cancel. As a result, the relative number of revolutions turns out to be finite. For the extremal black hole this is not so, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> can be infinite. Different choices of the local reference frame are considered, the results turn out to be the same qualitatively. For illustration, we discuss two explicit examples—rotation in the flat spacetime and in the Kerr metric.
We apply the dynamical systems approach to investigate the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type V models for the Palatini version of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. In particular, we examine the existence of equilibrium points along with their exact solutions and stability properties for two different forms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>). Moreover, the evolution of shear and spatial curvature by performing the phase space analysis are studied and also the phases of evolution from anisotropic universe to the stable de-Sitter flat universe are discussed.
Existing estimates of the gravitational-wave damping timescale of the dominant quadrupole oscillation mode in the case of rapidly rotating stars are based on using a Newtonian estimate for the energy of the mode, in combination with the lowest-order post-Newtonian quadrupole formula for estimating the gravitational-wave luminosity. We investigate a number of other choices for estimating the gravitational-wave damping timescale in the nonrotating limit and construct a highly accurate, empirically corrected formula that has a maximum relative error of only 3% with respect to the perturbative result in full general relativity. The expressions involved are sufficiently general to be extended to the case of rapidly rotating stars. We also present a new higher-order empirical relation for the gravitational-wave damping timescale of quadrupole oscillations that is accurate in the whole range of expected values for the compactness of neutron stars, without the need for involving the moment of inertia.
In Newtonian physics, higher temperature leads to higher thermal pressure, which provides stronger support against the gravitational contraction of stars. However, in the temperature range of tens of MeV involved in the evolution of a proto-neutron star or a higher massive neutron star, the effects of temperature are richer. We showed that, for a high temperature neutron star (HTNS) constructed with a realistic equation of state (EOS), the HTNS may expand or contract during cooling, the central density may increase or decrease, the quasi-normal mode oscillation frequencies may increase or decrease, and in particular, (i) independent of the EOS, for a HTNS of a given mass, there exists a maximum temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(T_{max}\)</span> that it could ever attend at birth (with the value of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(T_{max}\)</span> different for different EOS), and (ii) for the Hempel EOS and the Shen EOS, there is a range of mass that the HTNS may gravitationally collapse after a period of radiative cooling; however, for the Lattimer–Swesty EOS and Banik EOS, no delayed collapse is possible. Our study, which describes the cooling of HTNSs with simple quasi-stationary TOV sequences, provides an understanding of the effects of the thermal energy/pressure at high temperature, and a demonstration that different EOSs can lead to qualitatively different evolution paths.
In a seminal paper, Alcubierre showed that Einstein’s theory of general relativity appears to allow a super-luminal motion. In the present study, we use a recent eternal-warp-drive solution found by Alcubierre to study the effect of Hawking radiation upon an observer located within the warp drive in the framework of the quantum tunneling method. We find the same expression for the Hawking temperatures associated with the tunneling of both massive vector and scalar particles, and show this expression to be proportional to the velocity of the warp drive. On the other hand, since the discovery of gravitational waves, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes have also been extensively studied. With this purpose in mind, we perform a QNM analysis of massive scalar field perturbations in the background of the eternal-Alcubierre-warp-drive spacetime. Our analytical analysis shows that massive scalar perturbations lead to stable QNMs.
We illustrate the proposal, nicknamed LAGRANGE, to use spacecraft, located at the Sun–Earth Lagrange points, as a physical reference frame. Performing time of flight measurements of electromagnetic signals traveling on closed paths between the points, we show that it would be possible: (a) to refine gravitational time delay knowledge due both to the Sun and the Earth; (b) to detect the gravito-magnetic frame dragging of the Sun, so deducing information about the interior of the star; (c) to check the possible existence of a galactic gravitomagnetic field, which would imply a revision of the properties of a dark matter halo; (d) to set up a relativistic positioning and navigation system at the scale of the inner solar system. The paper presents estimated values for the relevant quantities and discusses the feasibility of the project analyzing the behavior of the space devices close to the Lagrange points.
We perform a short comparison between the local and linear constitutive tensor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\chi ^{\lambda \nu \sigma \kappa }\)</span> in four-dimensional electrodynamics, the elasticity tensor <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(c^{ijkl}\)</span> in three-dimensional elasticity theory, and the DeWitt metric <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(G^{abcd}\)</span> in general relativity, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\({a,b,\ldots =1,2,3}\)</span>. We find that the DeWitt metric has only six independent components.
We explore wave fronts of null geodesics in the Gödel metric emitted from point sources both at, and away from, the origin. For constant time wave fronts emitted by sources away from the origin, we find cusp ridges as well as blue sky metamorphoses where spatially disconnected portions of the wave front appear, connect to the main wave front, and then later break free and vanish. These blue sky metamorphoses in the constant time wave fronts highlight the non-causal features of the Gödel metric. We introduce a concept of physical distance along the null geodesics, and show that for wave fronts of constant physical distance, the reorganization of the points making up the wave front leads to the removal of cusp ridges.
An original way of presentation of the Schwarzschild black hole in the form of a point-like mass with making the use of the Dirac <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\delta \)</span>-function, including a description of a continuous collapse to such a point mass, is given. A maximally generalized description restricted by physically reasonable requirements is developed. A so-called field-theoretical formulation of general relativity, being equivalent to the standard geometrical presentation of general relativity, is used. All of the dynamical fields, including the gravitational field, are considered as propagating in a background (curved or flat) spacetime. Namely these properties allow us to present a non-contradictive picture of the point mass description. The results can be useful for studying the structure of the black hole true singularities and could be developed for practical calculations in models with black holes.
In this paper we explore the use of a new algebraic software package in providing independent covariant proof of a conjecture in general relativity. We examine the proof of two sub-cases of the shear-free conjecture <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\displaystyle \sigma =0 {\displaystyle \, =&gt;}\, {\displaystyle \omega }\,{\displaystyle \varTheta } =0\)</span> by Senovilla et al. (Gen. Relativ. Gravit 30:389–411, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">1998</a></span>): case 1: for dust; case 2: for acceleration parallel to vorticity. We use TensorPack, a software package recently released for the Maple environment. In this paper, we briefly summarise the key features of the software and then demonstrate its use by providing and discussing examples of independent proofs of the paper in question. A full set of our completed proofs is available online at <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.bach2roq.com/science/maths/GR/ShearFreeProofs.html"><span class="RefSource">http://www.bach2roq.com/science/maths/GR/ShearFreeProofs.html</span></a></span>. We are in agreeance with the equations provided in the original paper, noting that the proofs often require many steps. Furthermore, in our proofs we provide fully worked algebraic steps in such a way that the proofs can be examined systematically, and avoiding hand calculation. It is hoped that the elucidated proofs may be of use to other researchers in verifying the algebraic consistency of the expressions in the paper in question, as well as related literature. Furthermore we suggest that the appropriate use of algebraic software in covariant formalism could be useful for developing research and teaching in GR theory.
We introduce a framework for studying the effects of self-interaction on the construction of point particle initial data in General Relativity. Within this framework we rigorously prove the vanishing mass result of Arnowitt et al. (Phys Rev Lett 4: 375, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">1960</a></span>) regarding point sources. We identify a geometric structure and a scaling parameter that allow one to determine, by controlling the effects of self-interaction, when one does or does not obtain a non-zero mass.
We construct transformations which take asymptotically AdS hyperbolic initial data into asymptotically flat initial data, and which preserve relevant physical quantities. This is used to derive geometric inequalities in the asymptotically AdS hyperbolic setting from counterparts in the asymptotically flat realm, whenever a geometrically motivated system of elliptic equations admits a solution. The inequalities treated here relate mass, angular momentum, charge, and horizon area. Furthermore, new mass-angular momentum inequalities in this setting are conjectured and discussed.
The quasi-local scalar variables approach is applied to a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi metric containing a mixture of non-relativistic cold dark matter and coupled dark energy with constant equation of state. The quasi-local coupling term considered is proportional to the quasi-local cold dark matter energy density and a quasi-local Hubble factor-like scalar via a coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\alpha \)</span>. The autonomous numerical system obtained from the evolution equations is classified for different choices of the free parameters: the adiabatic constant of the dark energy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">w</em> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\alpha \)</span>. The presence of a past attractor in a non-physical region of the energy densities phase-space of the system makes the coupling term non physical when the energy flows from the matter to the dark energy in order to avoid negative values of the dark energy density in the past. On the other hand, if the energy flux goes from dark energy to dark matter, the past attractor lies in a physical region. The system is also numerically solved for some interesting initial profiles leading to different configurations: an ever expanding mixture, a scenario where the dark energy is completely consumed by the non-relativistic matter by means of the coupling term, a scenario where the dark energy disappears in the inner layers while the outer layers expand as a mixture of both sources, and, finally, a structure formation toy model scenario, where the inner shells containing the mixture collapse while the outer shells expand.
We perform a dynamical system analysis of a cosmological model with linear dependence between the vacuum density and the Hubble parameter, with constant-rate creation of dark matter. We show that the de Sitter spacetime is an asymptotically stable critical point, future limit of any expanding solution. Our analysis also shows that the Minkowski spacetime is an unstable critical point, which eventually collapses to a singularity. In this way, such a prescription for the vacuum decay not only predicts the correct future de Sitter limit, but also forbids the existence of a stable Minkowski universe. We also study the effect of matter creation on the growth of structures and their peculiar velocities, showing that it is inside the current errors of redshift space distortions observations.
The cosmological dynamics of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi type-III space-time is investigated in presence of a perfect fluid within the framework of Hu–Sawicki model. We use the dynamical system approach to perform a detailed analysis of the cosmological behaviour of this model for the model parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n=1, c_1=1\)</span>, determining all the fixed points, their stability and corresponding cosmological evolution. We have found stable fixed points with de Sitter solution along with unstable radiation like fixed points. We have identified a matter like point which act like an unstable spiral and when the initial conditions of a trajectory are very close to this point, it stabilizes at a stable accelerating point. Thus, in this model, the universe can naturally approach to a phase of accelerated expansion following a radiation or a matter dominated phase. It is also found that the isotropisation of this model is affected by the spatial curvature and that all the isotropic fixed points are found to be spatially flat.
In this paper we consider the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the tunneling formalism via Hamilton–Jacobi method to determine the quantum-corrected Hawking temperature and entropy for noncommutative BTZ black hole. In our results we obtain several types of corrections including the expected logarithmic correction to the area entropy associated with the noncommutative BTZ black holes. We also show that the area entropy product of the noncommutative BTZ black holes is dependent on mass and by analyzing the nature of the specific heat capacity we have observed that the noncommutative BTZ black hole is stable at some range of parameters.
Conformal transformation as a mathematical tool has been used in many areas of gravitational physics. In this paper, we consider gravity’s rainbow, in which the metric can be treated as a conformal rescaling of the original metric. By using the conformal transformation technique, we get a specific form of a modified Newton’s constant and cosmological constant in gravity’s rainbow, which implies that the total vacuum energy is dependent on probe energy. Moreover, the result shows that Einstein gravity’s rainbow can be described by energy-dependent <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f(E,\tilde{R})\)</span> gravity. At last, we study the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity, when gravity’s rainbow is considered, which can also be described as energy-dependent <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\tilde{f}(E,\tilde{R})\)</span> gravity.
This article extends bimetric formulations of massive gravity to make the mass of the graviton to depend on its environment. This minimal extension offers a novel way to reconcile massive gravity with local tests of general relativity without invoking the Vainshtein mechanism. On cosmological scales, it is argued that the model is stable and that it circumvents the Higuchi bound, hence relaxing the constraints on the parameter space. Moreover, with this extension the strong coupling scale is also environmentally dependent in such a way that it is kept sufficiently higher than the expansion rate all the way up to the very early universe, while the present graviton mass is low enough to be phenomenologically interesting. In this sense the extended bigravity theory serves as a partial UV completion of the standard bigravity theory. This extension is very generic and robust and a simple specific example is described.
A general method to extract thermodynamic quantities from solutions of the Einstein equation is developed. In 1994, Wald established that the entropy of a black hole could be identified as a Noether charge associated with a Killing vector of a global space-time (pseudo-Riemann) manifold. We reconstruct Wald’s method using geometrical language, e.g., via differential forms defined on the local space-time (Minkowski) manifold. Concurrently, the abstract thermodynamics are also reconstructed using geometrical terminology, which is parallel to general relativity. The correspondence between the thermodynamics and general relativity can be seen clearly by comparing the two expressions. This comparison requires a modification of Wald’s method. The new method is applied to Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr–Newman black holes and de Sitter space. The results are consistent with previous results obtained using various independent methods. This strongly supports the validity of the area theorem for black holes.
In this work, we consider a vacuum solution of Kaluza–Klein theory with cylindrical symmetry. We investigate the physical properties of the solution as viewed in four dimensional spacetime, which turns out to be a stationary, cylindrical wormhole supported by a scalar field and a magnetic field oriented along the wormhole. We then apply a boost to the five dimensional solution along the extra dimension, and perform the Kaluza–Klein reduction. As a result, we show that the new solution is still a wormhole with a radial electric field and a magnetic field stretched along the wormhole throat.
In this paper, we study the perturbation property of a scalar field coupling to Einstein’s tensor in the background of the regular black hole spacetimes. Our calculations show that the the coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\eta \)</span> imprints in the wave equation of a scalar perturbation. We calculated the quasinormal modes of scalar field coupling to Einstein’s tensor in the regular black hole spacetimes by the 3rd order WKB method.
The existence and stability of circular orbits (CO) in static and spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetime are important because of their practical and potential usefulness. In this paper, using the fixed point method, we first prove a necessary and sufficient condition on the metric function for the existence of timelike COs in SSS spacetimes. After analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the metric, we then show that asymptotic flat SSS spacetime that corresponds to a negative Newtonian potential at large <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> will always allow the existence of CO. The stability of the CO in a general SSS spacetime is then studied using the Lyapunov exponent method. Two sufficient conditions on the (in)stability of the COs are obtained. For null geodesics, a sufficient condition on the metric function for the (in)stability of null CO is also obtained. We then illustrate one powerful application of these results by showing that three SSS spacetimes whose metric function is not completely known will allow the existence of timelike and/or null COs. We also used our results to assert the existence and (in)stabilities of a number of known SSS metrics.
The Dirac equation is considered in a spacetime that represents a Schwarzschild metric coupled to a uniform external electromagnetic field. Due to the presence of electromagnetic field from the surroundings, the interaction with the spin-1/2 massive charged particle is considered. The equations of the spin-1/2 massive charged particle are separated into radial and angular equations by adopting the Newman–Penrose formalism. The angular equations obtained are similar to the Schwarzschild geometry. For the radial equations we manage to obtain the one dimensional Schrödinger-type wave equations with effective potentials. Finally, we study the behavior of the potentials by plotting them as a function of radial distance and expose the effect of the external parameter, charge and the frequency of the particle on them.
It is shown that in the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs–Maxwell system with Friedman–Robertson–Walker symmetries the energy density of the Higgs field has stable local minimum only if the mean curvature of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(t=\mathrm{const}\)</span> hypersurfaces is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">less</em> than a finite critical value <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\chi _c\)</span>, while for greater mean curvature the energy density is not bounded from below. Therefore, there are extreme gravitational situations in which <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">even quasi-locally defined instantaneous vacuum states of the Higgs sector cannot exist</em>, and hence <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">one cannot at all define the rest mass of all the classical fields</em>. On hypersurfaces with mean curvature less than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\chi _c\)</span> the energy density has the ‘wine bottle’ (rather than the familiar ‘Mexican hat’) shape, and the gauge field can get rest mass via the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. The spacelike hypersurface with the critical mean curvature represents the moment of ‘genesis’ of rest masses.
We have found two non-trivial massless Dirac and two massive Rarita–Schwinger solutions in plane wave spacetimes. The first order symmetry operator transforming one of the massless Dirac solution to the other is constructed. The only non-vanishing spinor bilinear generated by the standard spinor basis is obtained and algebraic relations between the induced parallel forms are demonstrated. It is also seen that the spin-3/2 norm of the Rarita–Schwinger solutions enforces to the massless sector.
In the paper Commun Anal Geom 16(1):217–229, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">2008</a></span>, a rigidity result was obtained for outermost marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) that do not admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. This allowed one to treat the “borderline case” in the author’s work with R. Schoen concerning the topology of higher dimensional black holes (Commun Math Phys 266(2):571–576, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">2006</a></span>). The proof of this rigidity result involved bending the initial data manifold in the vicinity of the MOTS within the ambient spacetime. In this note we show how to circumvent this step, and thereby obtain a pure initial data version of this rigidity result and its consequence concerning the topology of black holes.
We present general formulas for transverse and transverse-traceless (TT) symmetric tensors in flat spaces. TT tensors in conformally flat spaces can be obtained by means of a conformal transformation.
We study the motion of bound null geodesics with fixed coordinate radius around a five-dimensional rotating black hole. These spherical photon orbits are not confined to a plane, and can exhibit interesting quasiperiodic behaviour. We provide necessary conditions for the existence of these orbits, and explicitly compute the radii of circular orbits in the equatorial and polar planes. Finally, we plot representative examples of some of the types of possible orbits, commenting on their qualitative features.
We present a tetrad-based method for solving the Einstein field equations for spherically-symmetric systems and compare it with the widely-used Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) model. In particular, we focus on the issues of gauge ambiguity and the use of comoving versus ‘physical’ coordinate systems. We also clarify the correspondences between the two approaches, and illustrate their differences by applying them to the classic examples of the Schwarzschild and Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker spacetimes. We demonstrate that the tetrad-based method does not suffer from the gauge freedoms inherent to the LTB model, naturally accommodates non-uniform pressure and has a more transparent physical interpretation. We further apply our tetrad-based method to a generalised form of ‘Swiss cheese’ model, which consists of an interior spherical region surrounded by a spherical shell of vacuum that is embedded in an exterior background universe. In general, we allow the fluid in the interior and exterior regions to support pressure, and do not demand that the interior region be compensated. We pay particular attention to the form of the solution in the intervening vacuum region and illustrate the validity of Birkhoff’s theorem at both the metric and tetrad level. We then reconsider critically the original theoretical arguments underlying the so-called <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R_{\mathrm{h}} = ct\)</span> cosmological model, which has recently received considerable attention. These considerations in turn illustrate the interesting behaviour of a number of ‘horizons’ in general cosmological models.
Heun-type exact solutions emerge for both the radial and the angular equations for the case of a scalar particle coupled to the zero mass limit of both the Kerr and Kerr-(anti)de-Sitter spacetime. Since any type D metric has Heun-type solutions, it is interesting that this property is retained in the zero mass case. This work further refutes the claims that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> going to zero limit of the Kerr metric is both locally and globally the same as the Minkowski metric.
We discuss the issue of setting appropriate initial conditions for inflation. Specifically, we consider natural inflation model and discuss the fine tuning required for setting almost homogeneous initial conditions over a region of order several times the Hubble size which is orders of magnitude larger than any relevant correlation length for field fluctuations. We then propose to use the special propagating front solutions of reaction–diffusion equations for localized field domains of smaller sizes. Due to very small velocities of these propagating fronts we find that the inflaton field in such a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">field domain</em> changes very slowly, contrary to naive expectation of rapid roll down to the true vacuum. Continued expansion leads to the energy density in the Hubble region being dominated by the vacuum energy, thereby beginning the inflationary phase. Our results show that inflation can occur even with a single localized field domain of size smaller than the Hubble size. We discuss possible extensions of our results for different inflationary models, as well as various limitations of our analysis (e.g. neglecting self gravity of the localized field domain).
The Parikh–Kraus–Wilczeck tunneling radiation of black hole involving a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) global monopole is considered based on the generalized uncertainty principle. The influences from global monopole, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity and the corrections to the uncertainty appear in the expression of black hole entropy difference. It is found that the global monopole and the revision of general relativity both hinder the black hole from emitting the photons. The two parts as corrections to the uncertainty make the entropy difference of this kind of black hole larger or smaller respectively.
In this work, we first introduce a nonlinear Schrodinger and a nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations. Then we deform these equations to a the q-nonlinear Schrodinger and q-nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations. This is done using the formalism of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). We also study the deformed nonlinear solutions.
The observation of the inspiral and merger of compact binaries by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration ushered in a new era in the study of strong-field gravity. We review current and future tests of strong gravity and of the Kerr paradigm with gravitational-wave interferometers, both within a theory-agnostic framework (the parametrized post-Einsteinian formalism) and in the context of specific modified theories of gravity (scalar–tensor, Einstein–dilaton–Gauss–Bonnet, dynamical Chern–Simons, Lorentz-violating, and extra dimensional theories). In this contribution we focus on (i) the information carried by the inspiral radiation, and (ii) recent progress in numerical simulations of compact binary mergers in modified gravity.
We construct relativistic models of charged dust thick disks for a particular conformastatic spacetime through a Miyamoto–Nagai transformation used in Newtonian gravity to model disk like galaxies. Two simple families of thick disk models and a family of thick annular disks based on the field of an extreme Reissner–Nordström black hole and a Morgan–Morgan-like metric are considered. The electrogeodesic motion of test particles around the structures are analyzed. Also the stability of the particles against radial perturbation is studied using an extension of the Rayleigh criteria of stability of a fluid in rest in a gravitational field. The models built satisfy all the energy conditions.
Modified gravity theories include <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(f({\mathbf {R}})\)</span>-gravity models that are usually constrained by the cosmological evolutionary scenario. However, it has been recently shown that they can also be constrained by the signatures of accretion disk around constant Ricci curvature Kerr-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(f({\mathbf { R}}_{0})\)</span> stellar sized black holes. Our aim here is to use another experimental fact, viz., the terrestrial Sagnac delay to constrain the parameters of specific <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(f({\mathbf {R }})\)</span>-gravity prescriptions. We shall assume that a Kerr-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(f({\mathbf {R}}_{0})\)</span> solution asymptotically describes Earth’s weak gravity near its surface. In this spacetime, we shall study oppositely directed light beams from source/observer moving on non-geodesic and geodesic circular trajectories and calculate the time gap, when the beams re-unite. We obtain the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exact </em>time gap called Sagnac delay in both cases and expand it to show how the flat space value is corrected by the Ricci curvature, the mass and the spin of the gravitating source. Under the assumption that the magnitude of corrections are of the order of residual uncertainties in the delay measurement, we derive the allowed intervals for Ricci curvature. We conclude that the terrestrial Sagnac delay can be used to constrain the parameters of specific <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(f({\mathbf {R}})\)</span> prescriptions. Despite using the weak field gravity near Earth’s surface, it turns out that the model parameter ranges still remain the same as those obtained from the strong field accretion disk phenomenon.
We compute transition amplitudes between two spin networks with dipole graphs, using the Lorentzian EPRL model with up to two (non-simplicial) vertices. We find power-law decreasing amplitudes in the large spin limit, decreasing faster as the complexity of the foam increases. There are no oscillations nor asymptotic Regge actions at the order considered, nonetheless the amplitudes still induce non-trivial correlations. Spin correlations between the two dipoles appear only when one internal face is present in the foam. We compute them within a mini-superspace description, finding positive correlations, decreasing in value with the Immirzi parameter. The paper also provides an explicit guide to computing Lorentzian amplitudes using the factorisation property of SL(2,C) Clebsch–Gordan coefficients in terms of SU(2) ones. We discuss some of the difficulties of non-simplicial foams, and provide a specific criterion to partially limit the proliferation of diagrams. We systematically compare the results with the simplified EPRLs model, much faster to evaluate, to learn evidence on when it provides reliable approximations of the full amplitudes. Finally, we comment on implications of our results for the physics of non-simplicial spin foams and their resummation.
For ultra compact objects, light rings and fundamental photon orbits (FPOs) play a pivotal role in the theoretical analysis of strong gravitational lensing effects, and of BH shadows in particular. In this short review, specific models are considered to illustrate how FPOs can be useful in order to understand some non-trivial gravitational lensing effects. This paper aims at briefly overviewing the theoretical foundations of these effects, touching also some of the related phenomenology, both in general relativity and alternative theories of gravity, hopefully providing some intuition and new insights for the underlying physics, which might be critical when testing the Kerr black hole hypothesis.
The existence and stability of timelike and null circular orbits (COs) in the equatorial plane of general static and axisymmetric (SAS) spacetime are investigated in this work. Using the fixed point approach, we first obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-existence of timelike COs. It is then proven that there will always exist timelike COs at large <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\rho \)</span> in an asymptotically flat SAS spacetime with a positive ADM mass and moreover, these timelike COs are stable. Some other sufficient conditions on the stability of timelike COs are also solved. We then found the necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of null COs. It is generally shown that the existence of timelike COs in SAS spacetime does not imply the existence of null COs, and vice-versa, regardless whether the spacetime is asymptotically flat or the ADM mass is positive or not. These results are then used to show the existence of timelike COs and their stability in an SAS Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton spacetimes whose metric is not completely known. We also used the theorems to deduce the existence of timelike and null COs in some known SAS spacetimes.
In this paper, we explore propagation of energy flux in the future Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime. We present two results. First, we compute the flux integral of energy using the symplectic current density of the covariant phase space approach on hypersurfaces of constant radial physical distance. Using this computation we show that in the tt-projection, the integrand in the energy flux expression on the cosmological horizon is same as that on the future null infinity. This suggests that propagation of energy flux in de Sitter spacetime is sharp. Second, we relate our energy flux expression in tt-projection to a previously obtained expression using the Isaacson stress-tensor approach.
The null-surface formulation of general relativity (NSF) describes gravity by using families of null surfaces instead of a spacetime metric. Despite the fact that the NSF is (to within a conformal factor) equivalent to general relativity, the equations of the NSF are exceptionally difficult to solve, even in 2+1 dimensions. The present paper gives the first exact <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\((2+1)\)</span>-dimensional solution that depends nontrivially upon all three of the NSF’s intrinsic spacetime variables. The metric derived from this solution is shown to represent a spacetime whose source is a massless scalar field that satisfies the general relativistic wave equation and the Einstein equations with minimal coupling. The spacetime is identified as one of a family of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\((2+1)\)</span>-dimensional general relativistic spacetimes discovered by Cavaglià.
In this work we investigate the structure of white dwarfs using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations and compare our results with those obtained from Newtonian equations of gravitation in order to put in evidence the importance of general relativity (GR) for the structure of such stars. We consider in this work for the matter inside white dwarfs two equations of state, frequently found in the literature, namely, the Chandrasekhar and Salpeter equations of state. We find that using Newtonian equilibrium equations, the radii of massive white dwarfs (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M&gt;1.3M_{\odot }\)</span>) are overestimated in comparison with GR outcomes. For a mass of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(1.415M_{\odot }\)</span> the white dwarf radius predicted by GR is about 33% smaller than the Newtonian one. Hence, in this case, for the surface gravity the difference between the general relativistic and Newtonian outcomes is about 65%. We depict the general relativistic mass–radius diagrams as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(M/M_{\odot }=R/(a+bR+cR^2+dR^3+kR^4)\)</span>, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">c</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">d</em> are parameters obtained from a fitting procedure of the numerical results and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(k=(2.08\times 10^{-6}R_{\odot })^{-1}\)</span>, being <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R_{\odot }\)</span> the radius of the Sun in km. Lastly, we point out that GR plays an important role to determine any physical quantity that depends, simultaneously, on the mass and radius of massive white dwarfs.
We show that it is possible to locate the event horizon of a black hole (in arbitrary dimensions) by the zeros of certain Cartan invariants. This approach accounts for the recent results on the detection of stationary horizons using scalar polynomial curvature invariants, and improves upon them since the proposed method is computationally less expensive. As an application, we produce Cartan invariants that locate the event horizons for various exact four-dimensional and five-dimensional stationary, asymptotically flat (or (anti) de Sitter), black hole solutions and compare the Cartan invariants with the corresponding scalar curvature invariants that detect the event horizon.
In bigravity, when taking into account the potential existence of matter fields minimally coupled to the second gravitation sector, the dynamics of our Universe depends on some matter that cannot be observed in a direct way. In this paper, we assume the existence of a Noether symmetry in bigravity cosmologies in order to constrain the dynamics of that matter. By imposing this assumption we obtain cosmological models with interesting phenomenology. In fact, considering that our universe is filled with standard matter and radiation, we show that the existence of a Noether symmetry implies that either the dynamics of the second sector decouples, being the model equivalent to general relativity (GR), or the cosmological evolution of our universe tends to a de Sitter state with the vacuum energy in it given by the conserved quantity associated with the symmetry. The physical consequences of the genuine bigravity models obtained are briefly discussed. We also point out that the first model, which is equivalent to GR, may be favored due to the potential appearance of instabilities in the second model.
In the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity the concept of gravitational pressure and gravitational energy-momentum arisen in a natural way. In the case of a Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker space FLRW we obtain the total energy contained inside the apparent horizon and the radial pressure over the apparent horizon area. We use these definitions to written a thermodynamics relation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(T_{A}dS_{A} = dE_{A}+P_{A}dV_{A}\)</span> at the apparent horizon, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(E_{A}\)</span> is the total energy inside the apparent horizon, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(V_{A}\)</span> is the areal volume of the apparent horizon, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(P_{A}\)</span> is the radial pressure over the apparent horizon area, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(S_{A}\)</span> is the entropy which can be assumed as one quarter of the apparent horizon area only for a non stationary apparent horizon. We identify <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(T_{A}\)</span> as the temperature at the surface of the apparent horizon. We shown that for all expanding accelerated FLRW model of universe the radial pressure is positive.
In this paper we have investigated the gravitational lensing phenomenon in the strong field regime for a regular, charged, static black holes with non-linear electrodynamics source. We have obtained the angle of deflection and compared it to a Schwarzschild black hole and Reissner Nordström black hole with similar properties. We have also done a graphical study of the relativistic image positions and magnifications. We hope that this method may be useful in the detection of non-luminous bodies like this current black hole.
We study <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) cosmological models inserting a non-vanishing spatial curvature and discuss its consequences on cosmological dynamics. To figure this out, a polynomial <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) model and a double torsion model are considered. We first analyze those models with cosmic data, employing the recent surveys of Union 2.1, baryonic acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background measurements. We then emphasize that the two popular <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) models enable the crossing of the phantom divide line due to dark torsion. Afterwards, we compute numerical bounds up to 3-<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sigma \)</span> confidence level, emphasizing the fact that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Omega _{k0}\)</span> turns out to be non-compatible with zero at least at 1<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\sigma \)</span>. Moreover, we underline that, even increasing the accuracy, one cannot remove the degeneracy between our models and the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM paradigm. So that, we show that our treatments contain the concordance paradigm and we analyze the equation of state behaviors at different redshift domains. We also take into account gamma ray bursts and we describe the evolution of both the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) models with high redshift data. We calibrate the gamma ray burst measurements through small redshift surveys of data and we thus compare the main differences between non-flat and flat <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) cosmology at different redshift ranges. We finally match the corresponding outcomes with small redshift bounds provided by cosmography. To do so, we analyze the deceleration parameters and their variations, proportional to the jerk term. Even though the two models well fit late-time data, we notice that the polynomial <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) approach provides an effective de-Sitter phase, whereas the second <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) framework shows analogous results compared with the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM predictions.
In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics and Hawking radiation of Schwarzschild black hole with quintessence-like matter and deficit solid angle. From the metric of the black hole, we derive the expressions of temperature and specific heat using the laws of black hole thermodynamics. Using the null geodesics method and Parikh–Wilczeck tunneling method, we derive the expressions of Boltzmann factor and the change of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy for the black hole. The behaviors of the temperature, specific heat, Boltzmann factor and the change of Bekenstein entropy versus the deficit solid angle (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\epsilon ^{2}\)</span>) and the density of static spherically symmetric quintessence-like matter (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\rho _{0}\)</span>) were explicitly plotted. The results show that, when the deficit solid angle (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\epsilon ^{2}\)</span>) and the density of static spherically symmetric quintessence-like matter at <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(r=1\)</span> (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\rho _{0}\)</span>) vanish <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\((\rho _{0}=\epsilon =0)\)</span>, these four thermodynamics quantities are reduced to those obtained for the simple case of Schwarzschild black hole. For low entropies, the presence of quintessence-like matter induces a first order phase transition of the black hole and for the higher values of the entropies, we observe the second order phase transition. When increasing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\rho _{0}\)</span>, the transition points are shifted to lower entropies. The same thing is observed when increasing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\epsilon ^{2}\)</span>. In the absence of quintessence-like matter (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\rho _{0}=0\)</span>), these transition phenomena disappear. Moreover the rate of radiation decreases when increasing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\rho _{0}\)</span> or <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\((\epsilon ^2)\)</span>.
This paper presents general relativistic numerical simulations of uniformly rotating polytropes. Equations are developed using MSQI coordinates, but taking a logarithm of the radial coordinate. The result is relatively simple elliptical differential equations. Due to the logarithmic scale, we can resolve solutions with near-singular mass distributions near their center, while the solution domain extends many orders of magnitude larger than the radius of the distribution (to connect with flat space–time). Rotating solutions are found with very high central energy densities for a range of adiabatic exponents. Analytically, assuming the pressure is proportional to the energy density (which is true for polytropes in the limit of large energy density), we determine the small radius behavior of the metric potentials and energy density. This small radius behavior agrees well with the small radius behavior of large central density numerical results, lending confidence to our numerical approach. We compare results with rotating solutions available in the literature, which show good agreement. We study the stability of spherical solutions: instability sets in at the first maximum in mass versus central energy density; this is also consistent with results in the literature, and further lends confidence to the numerical approach.
The boundary of any observer’s spacetime is the boundary that divides what the observer can see from what they cannot see. The boundary of an observer’s spacetime in the presence of a black hole is not the true (future event) horizon of the black hole, but rather the illusory horizon, the dimming, redshifting surface of the star that collapsed to the black hole long ago. The illusory horizon is the source of Hawking radiation seen by observers both outside and inside the true horizon. The perceived acceleration (gravity) on the illusory horizon sets the characteristic frequency scale of Hawking radiation, even if that acceleration varies dynamically, as it must do from the perspective of an infalling observer. The acceleration seen by a non-rotating free-faller both on the illusory horizon below and in the sky above is calculated for a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, as an infaller approaches the singularity, the acceleration becomes isotropic, and diverging as a power law. The isotropic, power-law character of the Hawking radiation, coupled with conservation of energy–momentum, the trace anomaly, and the familiar behavior of Hawking radiation far from the black hole, leads to a complete description of the quantum energy–momentum inside a Schwarzschild black hole. The quantum energy–momentum near the singularity diverges as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r^{-6}\)</span>, and consists of relativistic Hawking radiation and negative energy vacuum in the ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(3 : -\,2\)</span>. The classical back reaction of the quantum energy–momentum on the geometry, calculated using the Einstein equations, serves merely to exacerbate the singularity. All the results are consistent with traditional calculations of the quantum energy–momentum in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions.
The LIGO/Virgo detections of binary black hole mergers marked a watershed moment in astronomy, ushering in the era of precision tests of Kerr dynamics. We review theoretical and experimental challenges that must be overcome to carry out black hole spectroscopy with present and future gravitational wave detectors. Among other topics, we discuss quasinormal mode excitation in binary mergers, astrophysical event rates, tests of black hole dynamics in modified theories of gravity, parameterized “post-Kerr” ringdown tests, exotic compact objects, and proposed data analysis methods to improve spectroscopic tests of Kerr dynamics by stacking multiple events.
In this paper, we re-examine the light deflection in the Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime. First, supposing a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we propose the definition of the total deflection angle <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\alpha \)</span> of the light ray by constructing a quadrilateral <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varSigma ^4\)</span> on the optical reference geometry <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\mathscr {M}}^\mathrm{opt}\)</span> determined by the optical metric <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\bar{g}_{ij}\)</span>. On the basis of the definition of the total deflection angle <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\alpha \)</span> and the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, we derive two formulas to calculate the total deflection angle <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\alpha \)</span>; (1) the angular formula that uses four angles determined on the optical reference geometry <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\({\mathscr {M}}^\mathrm{opt}\)</span> or the curved <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\((r, \phi )\)</span> subspace <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\({\mathscr {M}}^\mathrm{sub}\)</span> being a slice of constant time <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em> and (2) the integral formula on the optical reference geometry <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\({\mathscr {M}}^\mathrm{opt}\)</span> which is the areal integral of the Gaussian curvature <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> in the area of a quadrilateral <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\varSigma ^4\)</span> and the line integral of the geodesic curvature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(\kappa _g\)</span> along the curve <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(C_{\varGamma }\)</span>. As the curve <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq14">\(C_{\varGamma }\)</span>, we introduce the unperturbed reference line that is the null geodesic <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq15">\(\varGamma \)</span> on the background spacetime such as the Minkowski or the de Sitter spacetime, and is obtained by projecting <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq16">\(\varGamma \)</span> vertically onto the curved <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq17">\((r, \phi )\)</span> subspace <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq18">\({\mathscr {M}}^\mathrm{sub}\)</span>. We demonstrate that the two formulas give the same total deflection angle <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq19">\(\alpha \)</span> for the Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime. In particular, in the Schwarzschild case, the result coincides with Epstein–Shapiro’s formula when the source <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">S</em> and the receiver <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> of the light ray are located at infinity. In addition, in the Schwarzschild–de Sitter case, there appear order <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq20">\({\mathscr {O}}(\varLambda m)\)</span> terms in addition to the Schwarzschild-like part, while order <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq21">\({\mathscr {O}}(\varLambda )\)</span> terms disappear.
We investigate the relativistic dynamics of a Dirac field in the Som–Raychaudhuri space-time, which is described by a Gödel-type metric and a stationary cylindrical symmetric solution of Einstein field equations for a charged dust distribution in rigid rotation. In order to analyze the effect of various physical parameters of this space-time, we solve the Dirac equation in the Som–Raychaudhuri space-time and obtain the energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator by using the Nikiforov–Uvarov method. We also examine the behaviour of the Dirac oscillator in the Som–Raychaudhuri space-time, in particular, the effect of its frequency and the vorticity parameter.
Shortly after the discovery of the Kerr metric in 1963, it was realized that a region existed outside of the black hole’s event horizon where no time-like observer could remain stationary. In 1969, Roger Penrose showed that particles within this ergosphere region could possess negative energy, as measured by an observer at infinity. When captured by the horizon, these negative energy particles essentially extract mass and angular momentum from the black hole. While the decay of a single particle within the ergosphere is not a particularly efficient means of energy extraction, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">collision</em> of multiple particles can reach arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy in the limit of extremal black hole spin. The resulting particles can escape with high efficiency, potentially serving as a probe of high-energy particle physics as well as general relativity. In this paper, we briefly review the history of the field and highlight a specific astrophysical application of the collisional Penrose process: the potential to enhance annihilation of dark matter particles in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole.
The origin of magnetic fields in the universe still remains unknown and constitutes one of the most intriguing questions in astronomy and astrophysics. Their significance is enormous since they have a strong influence on many astrophysical phenomena. In regards of this motivation, theoretical models of galactic disks with sources of magnetic field may contribute to understand the physics behind them. Inspired by this, we present a new family of analytical models for thin disks composed by magnetized material. The solutions are axially symmetric, conformastatic and are obtained by solving the Einstein–Maxwell Field Equations for continuum media without the test field approximation, and assuming that the sources are razor-thin disk of magnetically polarized matter. We find analytical expressions for the surface energy density, the pressure, the polarization vector, the electromagnetic fields, the mass and the rotational velocity for circular orbits, for two particular solutions. In each case, the energy–momentum tensor agrees with the energy conditions and also the convergence of the mass for all the solutions is proved. Since the solutions are well-behaved, they may be used to model astrophysical thin disks, and also may contribute as initial data in numerical simulations. In addition, the process to obtain the solutions is described in detail, which may be used as a guide to find solutions with magnetized material in General Relativity.
A new CUDA-C code for tracing orbits around non-charged black holes is presented. This code, named MALBEC, take advantage of the graphic processing units and the CUDA platform for tracking null and timelike test particles in Schwarzschild and Kerr. Also, a new general set of equations that describe the closed circular orbits of any timelike test particle in the equatorial plane is derived. These equations are extremely important in order to compare the analytical behavior of the orbits with the numerical results and verify the correct implementation of the Runge–Kutta algorithm in MALBEC. Finally, other numerical tests are performed, demonstrating that MALBEC is able to reproduce some well-known results in these metrics in a faster and more efficient way than a conventional CPU implementation.
In this paper we investigate the absorption and radiation of nonminimally coupled scalar field from the charged BTZ black hole. We find the analytical expressions for the reflection coefficient, the absorption cross section and the decay rate in strong coupling case. We find that the reflection coefficient is directly governed by Hawking temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(T_{H}\)</span>, scalar wave frequency <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\omega \)</span>, Bekenstein–Hawking entropy <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(S_{BH}\)</span>, angular momentum <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and coupling constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\xi \)</span>.
Recently, a new interesting idea of origin of gravity has been developed by Verlinde. In this scheme of emergent gravity, where horizon entropy, microscopic de Sitter states and relevant contribution to gravity are involved, an entropy displacement resulting from matter behaves as a memory effect and can be exhibited at sub-Hubble scales, namely, the entropy displacement and its “elastic” response would lead to emergent gravity, which gives rise to an extra gravitational force. Then galactic dark matter effects may origin from such extra emergent gravity. We discuss some concepts in Verlinde’s theory of emergent gravity and point out some possible problems or issues, e.g., the gravitational potential caused by Verlinde’s emergent <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">apparent dark matter</em> may no longer be continuous in spatial distribution at ordinary matter boundary (such as a massive sphere surface). In order to avoid the unnatural discontinuity of the extra emergent gravity of Verlinde’s apparent dark matter, we suggest a modified dark-baryonic mass relation (a formula relating Verlinde’s apparent dark matter mass to ordinary baryonic matter mass) within this framework of emergent gravity. The modified mass relation is consistent with Verlinde’s result at relatively small scales (e.g., <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(R&lt;3h_{70}^{-1}\)</span> Mpc). However, it seems that, compared with Verlinde’s relation, at large scales (e.g., gravitating systems with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(R&gt;3h_{70}^{-1}\)</span> Mpc), the modified dark-baryonic mass relation presented here might be in better agreement with the experimental curves of weak lensing analysis in the recent work of Brouwer et al. Galactic rotation curves are compared between Verlinde’s emergent gravity and McGaugh’s recent model of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics established based on recent galaxy observations). It can be found that Verlinde rotational curves deviate far from those of McGaugh MOND model when the MOND effect (or emergent dark matter) dominates. Some applications of the modified dark-baryonic mass relation inspired by Verlinde’s emergent gravity will be addressed for galactic and solar scales. Potential possibilities to test this dark-baryonic mass relation as well as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">apparent dark matter</em> effects, e.g., planetary perihelion precession at Solar System scale, will be considered. This may enable to place some constraints on the magnitudes of the MOND characteristic acceleration at the small solar scale.
We study static non-critical hairy black holes of four dimensional gravitational model with nonminimal derivative coupling and a scalar potential turned on. By taking an ansatz, namely, the first derivative of the scalar field is proportional to square root of a metric function, we reduce the Einstein field equation and the scalar field equation of motions into a single highly nonlinear differential equation. This setup implies that the hair is secondary-like since the scalar charge-like depends on the non-constant mass-like quantity in the asymptotic limit. Then, we show that near boundaries the solution is not the critical point of the scalar potential and the effective geometries become spaces of constant scalar curvature.
We present a computational framework (<span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Rio</span>) in the ADM 3+1 approach for numerical relativity. This work enables us to carry out high resolution calculations for initial data of two arbitrary black holes. We use the transverse conformal treatment, the Bowen–York and the puncture methods. For the numerical solution of the Hamiltonian constraint we use the domain decomposition and the spectral decomposition of Galerkin–Collocation. The nonlinear numerical code solves the set of equations for the spectral modes using the standard Newton–Raphson method, LU decomposition and Gaussian quadratures. We show the convergence of the <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Rio</span> code. This code allows for easy deployment of large calculations. We show how the spin of one of the black holes is manifest in the conformal factor.
Using coupled harmonic oscillators model, we numerical analyze the entanglement entropy of massless scalar field in Gafinkle–Horowitz–Strominger (GHS) dilaton spacetime and Gibbons–Maeda (GM) dilaton spacetime. By numerical fitting, we find that the entanglement entropy of the dilaton black holes receive contribution from dilaton charge and is proportional to the area of the event horizon. It is interesting to note that the results of numerical fitting are coincide with ones obtained by using brick wall method and Euclidean path integral approach.
We investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a Lovelock-AdS black hole. Taking the first order logarithmic correction term in entropy we analyze the thermodynamic potentials like Helmholtz free energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy. We find that all the thermodynamic potentials are decreasing functions of correction coefficient <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span>. We also examined this correction coefficient must be positive by analysing <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(P{-}V\)</span> diagram. Further we study the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(P{-}V\)</span> criticality and stability and find that presence of logarithmic correction in it is necessary to have critical points and stable phases. When <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(P{-}V\)</span> criticality appears, we calculate the critical volume <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(V_c\)</span>, critical pressure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(P_c\)</span> and critical temperature <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(T_c\)</span> using different equations and show that there is no critical point for this black hole without thermal fluctuations. We also study the geometrothermodynamics of this kind of black holes. The Ricci scalar of the Ruppeiner metric is graphically analysed.
In this paper we point out some possible links between different approaches to quantum gravity and theories of the Planck scale physics. In particular, connections between loop quantum gravity, causal dynamical triangulations, Hořava–Lifshitz gravity, asymptotic safety scenario, Quantum Graphity, deformations of relativistic symmetries and nonlinear phase space models are discussed. The main focus is on quantum deformations of the Hypersurface Deformations Algebra and Poincaré algebra, nonlinear structure of phase space, the running dimension of spacetime and nontrivial phase diagram of quantum gravity. We present an attempt to arrange the observed relations in the form of a graph, highlighting different aspects of quantum gravity. The analysis is performed in the spirit of a mind map, which represents the architectural approach to the studied theory, being a natural way to describe the properties of a complex system. We hope that the constructed graphs (maps) will turn out to be helpful in uncovering the global picture of quantum gravity as a particular complex system and serve as a useful guide for the researchers.
The present work deals with the late time evolution of the linear density contrast in the dark energy models reconstructed from the jerk parameter. It is found that the non-interacting models are favoured compared to the models where an interaction is allowed in the dark sector.
We extend the Born–Oppenheimer type of approximation scheme for the Wheeler–DeWitt equation of canonical quantum gravity to arbitrary orders in the inverse Planck mass squared. We discuss in detail the origin of unitarity violation in this scheme and show that unitarity can be restored by an appropriate modification which requires back reaction from matter onto the gravitational sector. In our analysis, we heavily rely on the gauge aspects of the standard Born–Oppenheimer scheme in molecular physics.
We extend the analysis of the Hamiltonian formalism of the d-dimensional tetrad-connection gravity to the fermionic field by fixing the non-dynamic part of the spatial connection to zero (Lagraa et al. in Class Quantum Gravity 34:115010, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2017</a></span>). Although the reduced phase space is equipped with complicated Dirac brackets, the first-class constraints which generate the diffeomorphisms and the Lorentz transformations satisfy a closed algebra with structural constants analogous to that of the pure gravity. We also show the existence of a canonical transformation leading to a new reduced phase space equipped with Dirac brackets having a canonical form leading to the same algebra of the first-class constraints.
The Painlevé–Gullstrand coordinates allow us to explore the interior of the regular Hayward black hole. The behavior of an infalling particle in traversing the Hayward black hole is compared with the one inside the Schwarzschild and Reissner–Nordstrom singular black holes. When approaching the origin the test particle trajectories present differences depending if the center is regular or singular. The velocities of the infalling test particle into the modified Hayward black hole are analyzed as well. As compared with the normal Hayward, in the modified Hayward black hole the particle moves faster and the surface gravity is smaller.
In this paper, we discuss phase space analysis of locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I universe model by taking a noninteracting mixture of dust like and viscous radiation like fluid whose viscous pressure satisfies a nonlinear version of the Israel–Stewart transport equation. An autonomous system of equations is established by defining normalized dimensionless variables. In order to investigate stability of the system, we evaluate corresponding critical points for different values of the parameters. We also compute power-law scale factor whose behavior indicates different phases of the universe model. It is found that our analysis does not provide a complete immune from fine-tuning because the exponentially expanding solution occurs only for a particular range of parameters. We conclude that stable solutions exist in the presence of nonlinear model for bulk viscosity with different choices of the constant parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> for anisotropic universe.
In this paper we consider the three-dimensional Gödel black hole as a background and we study the vector particle tunneling from this background in order to obtain the Hawking temperature. Then, we study the propagation of a massive charged scalar field and we find the quasinormal modes analytically, which turns out be unstable as a consequence of the existence of closed time-like curves. Also, we consider the flux at the horizon and at infinity, and we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the absorption cross section. Mainly, we show that massive charged scalar waves can be superradiantly amplified by the three-dimensional Gödel black hole and that the coefficients have an oscillatory behavior. Moreover, the absorption cross section is null at the high frequency limit and for certain values of the frequency.
Hawking’s area theorem is a fundamental result in black hole theory that is universally associated with the null energy condition. That this condition can be weakened is illustrated by the formulation of a strengthened version of the theorem based on an energy condition that allows for violations of the null energy condition. With the semi-classical context in mind, some brief remarks pertaining to the suitability of the area theorem and its energy condition are made.
We investigate the motion of electrically charged test particles in spacetimes with closed timelike curves, a subset of the black hole or wormhole Reissner–Nordström-NUT spacetimes without periodic identification of time. We show that, while in the wormhole case there are closed worldlines inside a potential well, the wordlines of initially distant charged observers moving under the action of the Lorentz force can never close or self-intersect. This means that for these observers causality is preserved, which is an instance of our weak chronology protection criterion.
We perturb the non-rotating BTZ black hole with a non-minimally coupled massless scalar field, and we compute the quasinormal spectrum exactly. We solve the radial equation in terms of hypergeometric functions, and we obtain an analytical expression for the quasinormal frequencies. In addition, we compare our analytical results with the 6th order semi-analytical WKB method, and we find an excellent agreement. The impact of the nonminimal coupling as well as of the cosmological constant on the quasinormal spectrum is briefly discussed.
The shadow of a black hole is usually calculated, either analytically or numerically, on the assumption that the black hole is eternal, i.e., that it has existed for all time. Here we ask the question of how this shadow comes about in the course of time when a black hole is formed by gravitational collapse. To that end we consider a star that is spherically symmetric, dark and non-transparent and we assume that it begins, at some instant of time, to collapse in free fall like a ball of dust. We analytically calculate the dependence on time of the angular radius of the shadow, first for a static observer who is watching the collapse from a certain distance and then for an observer who is falling towards the centre following the collapsing star.
We compute the predictions for the power spectrum of scalar perturbations from a recent new proposal for the effective Hamiltonian of loop quantum cosmology. The model provides an attractive picture of the early cosmos, in which our classical Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe emerges from a quantum phase where the spacetime curvature remains constant and of Planckian size. We compare the predictions for the cosmic microwave background with previous results obtained within loop quantum cosmology, and discuss the differences and similarities. The analysis provides an example of the way differences between quantization schemes can be translated to physical observables.
We consider an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) action that is non-minimally coupled to a massive scalar field. The model closely resembles scalar–tensor theory and by conformal transformation can be transformed to Einstein frame. To avoid the ambiguity of the frame dependence, we obtain an exact analytical solution in Jordan frame and show that the model leads to a period of accelerated expansion with an exit. Further, we compute the scalar and tensor power spectrum for the model and compare them with observations.
The regular Hayward model describes a non-singular black hole space-time. By analyzing the behaviors of effective potential and solving the equation of orbital motion, we investigate the time-like and null geodesics in the regular Hayward black hole space-time. Through detailed analyses of corresponding effective potentials for massive particles and photons, all possible orbits are numerically simulated. The results show that there may exist four orbital types in the time-like geodesics structure: planetary orbits, circular orbits, escape orbits and absorbing orbits. In addition, when <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\ell \)</span>, a convenient encoding of the central energy density <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(3/8\pi \ell ^{2}\)</span>, is 0.6<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em> is 3.9512<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> as a specific value of angular momentum, escape orbits exist only under <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(b&gt;3.9512M\)</span>. The precession direction is also associated with values of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">b</em>. With <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(b=3.70M\)</span> the bound orbits shift clockwise but counter-clockwise with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(b=5.00M\)</span> in the regular Hayward black hole space-time. We also find that the structure of null geodesics is simpler than that of time-like geodesics. There only exist three kinds of orbits (unstable circle orbits, escape orbits and absorbing orbits).
To seek for a singularity free model universe from a perfect fluid scalar-metric cosmology, we work in the “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Emergent Cosmology</em>” (EC) paradigm which is a non-singular alternative for cosmological inflation. By using two methods including Linear Stability Theory and Effective Potential Formalism, we perform a classical analysis on the possible static solutions (that are called usually as Einstein Static Universes (ESU)in literature) in order to study EC paradigm in a FRW background. Our model contains a kinetic term of the scalar field minimally coupled to the background geometry without a potential term. The matter content of the model consists of a perfect fluid plus a cosmological constant <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Lambda \)</span> as a separate source. In the framework of a local dynamical system analysis, we show that in the absence or presence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>, depending on some adopted values for the free parameters of the underlying cosmological model with flat and non-flat spatial geometries, one gets some static solutions which are viable under classical linear perturbations. By extending our study to a global dynamical system analysis, we show that in the presence of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda \)</span> with non-flat spatial geometries there is a future global de Sitter attractor in this model. Following the second method, we derive a new static solution that represents a stable ESU but this time without dependence on the free parameters of the cosmological model at hand. As a whole, our analysis suggests the possibility of graceful realization of a non-singular EC paradigm (i.e. leaving the initial static phase and entering the inflation period as the universe is evolving) through either preserving or violation of the strong energy condition.
Many theories of quantum gravity live in higher dimensions, and their reduction to four dimensions via mechanisms such as Kaluza–Klein compactification or brane world models have associated problems. We propose a novel mechanism of dimensional reduction via spontaneous symmetry breaking of a higher dimensional local Lorentz group to one in lower dimensions. Working in the gauge theory formulation of gravity, we couple a Higgs field to spin connections, include a potential for the field, and show that for a suitable choice of Higgs vacuum, the local Lorentz symmetry of the action gets spontaneously reduced to one in a lower dimension. Thus effectively the dimension of spacetime gets reduced by one. This provides a viable mechanism for the dimensional reduction, and may have applications in theories of quantum gravity.
The generic null geodesic of the Schwarzschild–Kruskal–Szekeres geometry has a natural complexification, an elliptic curve with a cusp at the singularity. To realize that complexification as a Riemann surface without a cusp, and also to ensure conservation of energy at the singularity, requires a branched cover of the space-time over the singularity, with the geodesic being doubled as well to obtain a genus two hyperelliptic curve with an extra involution. Furthermore, the resulting space-time obtained from this branch cover has a Hamiltonian that is null geodesically complete. The full complex null geodesic can be realized in a natural complexification of the Kruskal–Szekeres metric.
We investigate two physical quantities that might observationally distinguish between Kerr black holes and rotating naked singularities. These are the Lense–Thirring precession frequency as measured by a Copernican observer, and tidal forces. We establish strong enhancement for both these quantities due to a Janis–Newman–Winicour naked singularity background, as compared to the Kerr case. We first show that the precession frequency of a test gyroscope at a given radius can be enhanced by almost an order of magnitude in the background of the naked singularity, as compared to the Kerr black hole. We then show that a critical mass for celestial objects below which these disintegrate due to tidal forces might increase by more than an order of magnitude in the naked singularity background, compared to the black hole. Our results complement the existing ones in the literature regarding differences in observable quantities in such backgrounds, and might be of significance in futuristic experiments.
A white hole (WH) is a time-reversed black hole (BH) solution in general relativity with a spacetime region to which cannot be entered from the outside. Recently they have been proposed as a possible solution to the information loss problem (Haggard et al. in Phys Rev D 92:104020, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR60">2015</a></span>). In particular it has been argued that the quantization of the gravitational field may prevent a BH from collapsing entirely with an exponential decay law associated to the black-hole-to-white-hole (BHWH) tunneling scenario (Barcelo et al. in Class Quantum Gravit 34:105007, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR68">2017</a></span>). During this period of BHWH transition the Hawking radiation should take place. Taking this possibility into account, we utilize the Hamilton–Jacobi and Parkih–Wilczek methods to study the Hawking radiation viewed as a quantum tunneling effect to calculate the tunneling rate of vector particles tunneling inside (outside) the horizon of a WH (BH), respectively. We show that there is a Hawking radiation associated to a WH spacetime equal to the BH Hawking temperature when viewed from the outside region of the WH geometry. In the framework of Parkih–Wilczek method, surprisingly, we show that Hawking temperature is affected by the initial radial distance at which the gravitational collapse starts.
We study the gauge transformation in the context of gravitoelectromagnetism and introduce a new expression for the phase factor. Using these concepts and with the principle of local gauge invariance applied to physical theories, a formal derivation of gravitoelectromagnetism is obtained.
We use a mathematical approach based on the constraints systems in order to reconstruct the equation of state and the inflationary potential for the inflaton field from the observed spectral indices for the density perturbations <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n_{s}\)</span> and the tensor to scalar ratio <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>. From the astronomical data, we can observe that the measured values of these two indices lie on a two-dimensional surface. We express these indices in terms of the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we assume that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(n_{s}-1=h\left( r\right) \)</span>. For the function <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(h\left( r\right) \)</span>, we consider three cases, where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(h\left( r\right) \)</span> is constant, linear and quadratic, respectively. From this, we derive second-order equations whose solutions provide us with the explicit forms for the expansion scale-factor, the scalar-field potential, and the effective equation of state for the scalar field. Finally, we show that for there exist mappings which transform one cosmological solution to another and allow new solutions to be generated from existing ones.
We prove that, in a space-time of dimension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(n&gt;3\)</span> with a velocity field that is shear-free, vorticity-free and acceleration-free, the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero if and only if the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity is zero. This extends a property found in generalised Robertson–Walker spacetimes, where the velocity is also eigenvector of the Ricci tensor. Despite the simplicity of the statement, the proof is involved. As a product of the same calculation, we introduce a curvature tensor with an interesting recurrence property.
We develop the properties of Weyl geometry, beginning with a review of the conformal properties of Riemannian spacetimes. Decomposition of the Riemann curvature into trace and traceless parts allows an easy proof that the Weyl curvature tensor is the conformally invariant part of the Riemann curvature, and shows the explicit change in the Ricci and Schouten tensors required to insure conformal invariance. We include a proof of the well-known condition for the existence of a conformal transformation to a Ricci-flat spacetime. We generalize this to a derivation of the condition for the existence of a conformal transformation to a spacetime satisfying the Einstein equation with matter sources. Then, enlarging the symmetry from Poincaré to Weyl, we develop the Cartan structure equations of Weyl geometry, the form of the curvature tensor and its relationship to the Riemann curvature of the corresponding Riemannian geometry. We present a simple theory of Weyl-covariant gravity based on a curvature-linear action, and show that it is conformally equivalent to general relativity. This theory is invariant under local dilatations, but not the full conformal group.
In a higher-order modified teleparallel theory cosmological we present analytical cosmological solutions. In particular we determine forms of the unknown potential which drives the scalar field such that the field equations form a Liouville integrable system. For the determination of the conservation laws we apply the Cartan symmetries. Furthermore, inspired from our solutions, a toy model is studied and it is shown that it can describe the Supernova data, while at the same time introduces dark matter components in the Hubble function. When the extra matter source is a stiff fluid then we show how analytical solutions for Bianchi I universes can be constructed from our analysis. Finally, we perform a global dynamical analysis of the field equations by using variables different from that of the Hubble-normalization.
The effects of charge on stable structure of spherically symmetric collapsing model comprising anisotropic matter distribution are studied in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) gravity, where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em> correspond to scalar curvature and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We construct the field equations, Maxwell equations and dynamical equations in this scenario. We employ linear perturbation scheme on physical variables, metric functions as well as modified terms to establish the evolution or collapse equation for a consistent functional form of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">T</em>) gravity. We investigate the limit of instability in Newtonian as well as post Newtonian regimes. It is found that charge plays a fundamental role to slow down the collapse and form a more stable system.
We investigate the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation for spin-zero bosons in a (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(3+1\)</span>)-dimensional Som–Raychaudhuri space–time. We establish the covariant Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation in this curved space–time for the so-called oscillator and we include interaction with a scalar potential. We determine eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues for the oscillator with the Cornell potential. We investigate the effect of the space–time’s parameters, oscillator’s frequency and the Cornell potential’s parameters on the wave functions.
We introduce the noncommutative geometry inspired Ayón Beato García black hole metric and study various properties of this metric by which we try to probe the allowed values of the noncommutative parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\vartheta \)</span> under certain conditions. We then construct the shadow (apparent shape) cast by this black hole. We derive the corresponding photon orbits and explore the effects of noncommutative spacetime on them. We then study the effects of noncommutative parameter <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\vartheta \)</span>, smeared mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>), smeared charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em>) on the silhouette of the shadow analytically and present the results graphically. We then discuss the deformation which arises in the shape of the shadow under various conditions. Finally, we introduce a plasma background and observe how the shadow behaves in this scenario.
We show that the conservation laws for the geodesic equation which are associated to affine symmetries can be obtained from symmetries of the Lagrangian for affinely parametrized geodesics according to Noether’s theorem, in contrast to claims found in the literature. In particular, using Aminova’s classification of affine motions of Lorentzian manifolds, we show in detail how affine motions define generalized symmetries of the geodesic Lagrangian. We compute all infinitesimal proper affine symmetries and the corresponding geodesic conservation laws for all homogeneous solutions to the Einstein field equations in four spacetime dimensions with each of the following energy–momentum contents: vacuum, cosmological constant, perfect fluid, pure radiation, and homogeneous electromagnetic fields.
In this work we study a phenomenological non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and dark energy. The scenario studied in this work extends the usual interaction model proportional to the derivative of the dark component density adding to the coupling a non-linear term of the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(Q = \rho '/3(\alpha + \beta \rho _{Dark})\)</span> This dark sector interaction model could be interpreted as a particular case of a running vacuum model of the type <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda (H) = n_0 + n_1 H^2 + n_2 H^4\)</span> in which the vacuum decays into dark matter. For a flat FRW Universe filled with dark energy, dark matter and decoupled baryonic matter and radiation we calculate the energy density evolution equations of the dark sector and solve them. The different sign combinations of the two parameters of the model show clear qualitative different cosmological scenarios, from basic cosmological insights we discard some of them. The linear scalar perturbation equations of the dark matter were calculated. Using the CAMB code we calculate the CMB and matter power spectra for some values of the parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\alpha \)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\beta \)</span> and compare it with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM. The model modify mainly the lower multipoles of the CMB power spectrum remaining almost the same the high ones. The matter power spectrum for low wave numbers is not modified by the interaction but after the maximum it is clearly different. Using observational data from Planck, and various galaxy surveys we obtain the constraints of the parameters, the best fit values obtained are the combinations <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\alpha = (3.7 \pm 7 )\times 10^{-4} \)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(-\,(1.5\times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{eV}^{-1})^{4} \ll \beta &lt; (0.07\,\mathrm{eV}^{-1})^4\)</span>.
X-ray studies of stellar mass black holes in X-ray binaries and mass-accreting supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei have achieved a high degree of maturity and have delivered detailed information about the astrophysical sources and the physics of black hole accretion. In this article, I review recent progress made towards using the X-ray observations for testing the “Kerr hypothesis” that the background spacetimes of all astrophysical quasi-stationary black holes are described by the Kerr metric. Although the observations have indeed revealed clear evidence for relativistic effects in strong-field gravity, quantitative tests of the Kerr hypothesis still struggle with theoretical and practical difficulties. In this article, I describe several recently introduced test metrics and review the status of constraining the background spacetimes of mass accreting stellar mass and supermassive black holes with these test metrics. The main conclusion of the discussion is that astrophysical uncertainties are large compared to the rather small observational differences between the Kerr and non-Kerr metrics precluding quantitative constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric at this point in time. I conclude with discussing future progress enabled by more detailed numerical simulations and by future X-ray spectroscopy, timing, polarimetry, and interferometry missions.
The Weiss variational principle in mechanics and classical field theory is a variational principle which allows displacements of the boundary. We review the Weiss variation in mechanics and classical field theory, and present a novel geometric derivation of the Weiss variation for the gravitational action: the Einstein–Hilbert action plus the Gibbons–Hawking–York boundary term. In particular, we use the first and second variation of area formulas (we present a derivation accessible to physicists in an “Appendix”) to interpret and vary the Gibbons–Hawking–York boundary term. The Weiss variation for the gravitational action is in principle known to the Relativity community, but the variation of area approach formalizes the derivation, and facilitates the discussion of time evolution in General Relativity. A potentially useful feature of the formalism presented in this article is that it avoids an explicit 3 <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(+\)</span> 1 decomposition in the bulk spacetime.
In this paper the dynamic compactification in Lovelock gravity with a cubic term is studied. The ansatz will be of space–time where the three dimensional space and the extra dimensions are constant curvature manifolds with independent scale factors. The numerical analysis shows that there exist a phenomenologically realistic compactification regime where the three dimensional hubble parameter and the extra dimensional scale factor tend to a constant. This result comes as surprise as in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity this regime exists only when the couplings of the theory are such that the theory does not admit a maximally symmetric solution (i.e. “geometric frustration”). In cubic Lovelock gravity however there always exists at least one maximally symmetric solution which makes it fundamentally different from the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet case. Moreover, in opposition to Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet Gravity, it is also found that for some values of the couplings and initial conditions these compactification regimes can coexist with isotropizing solutions.
We propose a Classical Einstein–Langevin equation, for certain applications in Astrophysics and Cosmology. The domain of applications and the formulation are quite different than its semiclassical counterpart, which is an active area of research and inspires one to carry out this new formalism. The field of study can be seen to emerge out of well established ideas and results in Stochastic Processes in Newtonian Physics and the Physics in curved spacetime. This is an effort to combine ideas from the two areas to get meaningful and new physical results in astrophysics and cosmology. A brief calculation, to demonstrate the contribution of stochasticity and induced fluctuations to the spacetime metric, for static spherically symmetric relativistic stars by heuristic solution of the Classical Einstein–Langevin equation is given. The applicability of the proposed formalism can have a wider expanse than is mentioned in this article.
It is well-known that the exact solution of non-linear <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\sigma \)</span> model coupled to gravity can be perceived as an exterior gravitational field of a global monopole. Here we study Einstein’s equations coupled to a non-linear <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\sigma \)</span> model with Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) kinetic term in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> dimensions. The solution describes a metric around a DBI global defects. When the core is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius it can be interpreted as a black hole having DBI scalar hair with deficit conical angle. The solutions exist for all <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>, but they can be expressed as polynomial functions in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> only when <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em> is even. We give conditions for the mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> and the scalar charge <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\eta \)</span> in the extremal case. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes in canonical ensemble. The monopole alter the stability differently in each dimensions. As the charge increases the black hole radiates more, in contrast to its counterpart with ordinary global defects where the Hawking temperature is minimum for critical <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\eta \)</span>. This behavior can also be observed for variation of DBI coupling, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\beta \)</span>. As it gets stronger (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\beta \ll 1\)</span>) the temperature increases. By studying the heat capacity we can infer that there is no phase transition in asymptotically-flat spacetime. The AdS black holes, on the other hand, undergo a first-ordered phase transition in the Hawking–Page type. The increase of the DBI coupling renders the phase transition happen for larger radius.
The present study deals with the spherically symmetric distributions of dust dissipative fluids with a central vacuum cavity, evolving under the condition of vanishing of expansion scalar. The work is based on two aspects—on the one hand the description of model in terms of structures scalars emerging in the orthogonal splitting of Riemann tensor. Secondly, to obtain the solutions of dynamical equations under some special cases and assumption on implicit function of variables. The solutions here discussed, model the evolution of the vacuum cavity of fluid distribution, thereby showing the potential of expansion free motion.
Current observations suggest that our Universe is not incompatible with a small positive spatial curvature that can be associated with rest frames having a “closed” standard topology. We examine a toy model generalisation of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varLambda \)</span>CDM model in the form of ever expanding Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) models with positive spatial curvature. It is well known that such models with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varLambda =0\)</span> exhibit a thin layer distribution at the turning values of the area distance that must be studied through the Israel–Lanczos formalism. We find that this distributional source exhibits an unphysical behaviour for large cosmic times and its presence can be detected observationally. However, these unphysical features can always be avoided by assuming <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\varLambda &gt;0\)</span>. While these LTB models are very simplified, we believe that these results provide a simple argument favouring the assumption of a nonzero positive cosmological constant in cosmological models.
We consider 3 + 1 rotationally symmetric Lorentzian Einstein spacetime manifolds with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varLambda &gt;0\)</span> and reduce the field equations to 2 + 1 Einstein’s equations coupled to ‘shifted’ wave maps. Subsequently, we prove various (explicit) positive mass-energy theorems. No smallness is assumed.
In the present paper, we study Casimir effect for a conformally coupled scalar field propagating on background of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(4+1\)</span>-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space-time. The field is supposed to obey Dirichlet boundary condition on two 4-dimensional curved boundaries. Technically, we accomplish our calculations using an indefinite field quantization scheme, which already has been successfully applied to the dS minimally coupled massless scalar field and the dS linear gravity to obtain a causal and fully covariant quantum field on dS space-time.
As our understanding of the past in a bouncing universe is limited, it becomes difficult to propose a cosmological model which can give some understanding of the causal structure of the bouncing universe. In this article we address the issue related to the particle horizon problem in the bouncing universe models. It is shown that in many models the particle horizon does not exist, and consequently the horizon problem is trivially solved. In some cases a bouncing universe can have a particle horizon and we specify the conditions for its existence. In the absence of a particle horizon the Hubble surface specifies the causal structure of a bouncing universe. We specify the complex relationship between the Hubble surface and the particle horizon when the particle horizon exists. The article also address the issue related to the event horizon in a bouncing universe. A toy example of a bouncing universe is first presented where we specify the conditions which dictate the presence of a particle horizon. Next we specify the causal structures of three widely used bouncing models. The first case is related to quintom matter bounce model, the second one is loop quantum cosmology based bounce model and lastly <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity induced bounce model. We present a brief discussion on the horizon problem in bouncing cosmologies. We point out that the causal structure of the various bounce models fit our general theoretical predictions.
In this work, both extended phase space and holographic equipartition approaches are employed to develop an exact Van der Waals description of non-rotating <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(D=4\)</span> SAdS black holes as an ensemble of spacetime atoms. After a possible microscopical interaction model is introduced, statistical mechanics techniques, with certain heuristic gravitational constraints, are used to derive the equation of state and the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. The procedure is generalized to the charged <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(D=4\)</span> SAdS black hole and to arbitrary <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(D\ge 3\)</span> dimensions for the uncharged cases.
A harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) and a time-dependent (squared) frequency <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\omega ^2(t)\)</span> occurs in the modelling of several physical systems. It is generally believed that systems, with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(m(t)&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\omega ^2(t)&gt;0\)</span> (normal oscillator) are stable while systems with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(m(t)&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\omega ^2(t)&lt;0\)</span> (inverted oscillator) are unstable. We show that it is possible to represent the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">same</em> physical system either as a normal oscillator or as an inverted oscillator by redefinition of dynamical variables. While we expect the physics to be invariant under such redefinitions, it is not obvious how this invariance actually comes about. We study the relation between these two, normal and inverted, representations of an oscillator in detail both in Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures to clarify several conceptual and technical issues. The situation becomes more involved when the oscillator is coupled to another (semi)classical degree of freedom <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) and we want to study the back-reaction of the quantum system <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">q</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>) on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">C</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">t</em>), in the semi-classical approximation. We provide a simple prescription for the back-reaction based on energy conservation and study that the dynamics of the full system in both normal and the inverted oscillator representation. The physics again remains invariant but there are some extra subtleties which we clarify. The implications of these results for quantum field theory in cosmological backgrounds are discussed briefly in an appendix.
In this work we investigate the dynamics of cosmological models with spherical topology containing up to 600 Schwarzschild black holes arranged in an irregular manner. We solve the field equations by tessellating the 3-sphere into eight identical cells, each having a single edge which is shared by all cells. The shared edge is enforced to be locally rotationally symmetric, thereby allowing for solving the dynamics to high accuracy along this edge. Each cell will then carry an identical (up to parity) configuration which can however have an arbitrarily random distribution. The dynamics of such models is compared to that of previous works on regularly distributed black holes as well as with the standard isotropic dust models of the FLRW type. The irregular models are shown to have richer dynamics than that of the regular models. The randomization of the distribution of the black holes is done both without bias and also with a certain clustering bias. The geometry of the initial configuration of our models is shown to be qualitatively different from the regular case in the way it approaches the isotropic model.
In a previous paper it was shown that a minimally coupled scalar field of mass <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(M \sim H_0\)</span> can describe both components of the dark sector in a unified way. In the solution found, the dark energy component decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, with a homogeneous creation of dark matter. In the present note we show that a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Lambda \)</span>CDM dark sector can also be modeled by such a single field. More generally, we show that the system of Klein–Gordon and Einstein equations admits a uniparametric family of solutions that is equivalent to a non-adiabatic (with zero sound speed) generalised Chaplygin gas.
In the zero momentum limit we exactly calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the massive Dirac field propagating in a Lifshitz black brane. Our results are an extension of those for the massive Klein–Gordon field in the zero momentum limit, but in contrast to the boson field for which only the Dirichlet boundary condition was imposed at the asymptotic region, here we impose two different boundary conditions far from the event horizon and compare the values obtained for the quasinormal frequencies. Furthermore, based on our results we determine some relevant limits, study the classical stability of the quasinormal modes of the Dirac field and determine its relaxation times.
In the present work, we attempt to find a new class of solutions for the spherically symmetric perfect fluid sphere by employing the homotopy perturbation method (HPM), a new tool via which the mass polynomial function facilitates to tackle the Einstein field equations. A set of interior solutions found on the basis of the simplest MIT bag model equation of state in the form <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho -4B)\)</span> where <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">B</em> is the bag constant. The proposed interior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also conduct a detailed study on different tests, viz. the energy conditions, TOV equation, adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc., to verify the physical validity of the proposed model. The numerical value of the used parameters are predicted for different strange star candidates, for different chosen values of the bag constant. In a nutshell, by exploiting HPM technique first time ever in the field of relativistic astrophysics, we have predicted in the present literature a singularity-free and stable stellar model which is suitable to describe ultra-dense objects, like strange (quark) stars.
In the 1950’s Herman Bondi observed that a very effective way to study gravitational radiation was to use null surfaces as part of the coordinate system for analyzing the Einstein (Einstein–Maxwell) equations. A particular class of such surfaces, (referred to as Bondi null surfaces) with their associated null tetrad, has now been the main tool for this analysis for many years; their use—until recently—has been almost ubiquitous. Several years ago we realized that there was an attractive alternative to the use of Bondi coordinates, namely to use coordinates (in the asymptotic null future space–time region) that were as close to ordinary flat-space light-cones as possible—very different from Bondi surfaces. There were initially serious impediments to this program: these new null surfaces (referred to as asymptotically shear-free surfaces, ASF) were determined by solving a non-linear differential equation (the “good-cut” equation) whose solutions were most often complex. Eventually these problems were overcome and the program was implemented. In a series of papers, using the ASF null surfaces to study the asymptotically flat Einstein (or Einstein–Maxwell) equations, a variety of surprising (strange) results were obtained. Using only the Einstein and Maxwell equations, we found a large number of the basic relations of classical mechanics. They included very detailed conservation laws, well know kinematic relations and dynamic equations and even the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac radiation reaction force and the rocket force. As interesting as these were, they came with a serious enigma. These relations from classical mechanics had no relationship with the physical space–time. The space for the action of these relations was the parameter space of solutions of the good-cut equation—a complex space, known as H-space. The enigma—what possible relationship did these <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">standard appearing</em> classical relations have with physical space–time? It is the purpose of this work to establish such a relationship—objects in H-space are related to structures in physical space–time. For example, a complex world-line in H-space becomes in physical space–time an asymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruence where its twist describes its intrinsic spin and if charged, its magnetic dipole.
A scenario of leptogenesis was introduced in Alexander et al. (Phys Rev Lett 96:081301, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">2006</a></span>) which works during inflationary period within standard model of particle physics setup. In this scenario lepton number is created by the gravitational chiral anomaly which has a non-zero expectation value for models of inflation driven by pseudoscalar field(s). Here, we observe that models of inflation involving non-Abelian gauge fields, e.g. the chromo-natural inflation (Adshead and Wyman in Phys Rev Lett 108:261302, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2012</a></span>) or the gauge-flation (Maleknejad and Sheikh-Jabbari in Phys Lett B 723:224, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">2013</a></span>. <span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1513"><span class="RefSource">arXiv:1102.1513</span></a></span> [hep-ph]), have a parity-violating tensor mode (graviton) spectrum and naturally lead to a non-vanishing expectation value for the gravitational chiral anomaly. Therefore, one has a natural leptogenesis scenario associated with these inflationary setups, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">inflato-natural leptogenesis</em>. We argue that the observed value of baryon-to-photon number density can be explained in a natural range of parameters in these models.

In this note we present a result establishing the existence of a compact CMC Cauchy surface from a curvature condition related to the strong energy condition.
For a plane gravitational wave whose profile is given, in Brinkmann coordinates, by a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2\times 2\)</span> symmetric traceless matrix <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U</em>), the matrix Sturm–Liouville equation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\ddot{P}=KP\)</span> plays a multiple and central rôle: (i) it determines the isometries; (ii) it appears as the key tool for switching from Brinkmann to BJR coordinates and vice versa; (iii) it determines the trajectories of particles initially at rest. All trajectories can be obtained from trivial “Carrollian” ones by a suitable action of the (broken) Carrollian isometry group.
The first law of entanglement has been used to obtain the linearized Einstein equations of the holographic dual spacetimes. In the present paper, the first law of entanglement in Quasi-Topological gravity is explicitly derived by using the Iyer–Wald formalism. In addition, we investigate the extended first law of entanglement for the special case in Quasi-Topological gravity.
We show that the test body stable circular orbits around the spherically symmetric black hole (BH) configuration can form disjoint structures in presence of a minimally coupled nonlinear scalar field. General conditions for the disjoint structures to exist are formulated. To present examples we construct a two-parametric family of exact solutions to Einstein equations with scalar fields for appropriate self-interaction potentials. For different values of the family parameters the solutions describe either BH or naked singularity (NS). We found numerically regions of the parameters when there exist two disjoint regions of stable circular orbits; such nonconnected structures indeed can exist in case of both BH and NS solutions.
The dynamics of Einstein–conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system is investigated near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman–Robertson–Walker symmetries. We solve the field equations asymptotically up to fourth order near the singularities analytically, and determine the solutions numerically as well. We found all the asymptotic, power series singular solutions, which are (1) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity but the Higgs field is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bounded</em> (‘Small Bang’), or (2) solutions with a Milne type singularity with bounded spacetime curvature and Higgs field, or (3) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity and diverging Higgs field (‘Big Bang’). Thus, in the present EccH model there is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new kind</em> of physical spacetime singularity (‘Small Bang’). We also show that, in a neighbourhood of the singularity in these solutions, the Higgs sector does not have any symmetry breaking instantaneous vacuum state, and hence then the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism does not work. The large scale behaviour of the solutions is investigated numerically as well. In particular, the numerical calculations indicate that there are singular solutions that cannot be approximated by power series.
We consider a charged five-dimensional Myers–Perry black hole in a uniform magnetic (test) field. Using the Komar mass formula, we calculate the total energy of the electromagnetic field within the truncation three-sphere for a five-dimensional rotating black hole with two equal-rotation parameters and two equal-magnetic field strengths. We show that the total electromagnetic energy takes the minimum value when the five-dimensional rotating black hole acquires a non-zero net electric charge <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>.
The causal properties of the family of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes are analyzed and compared to those of the Kerr family. First, an inextendible Kerr-de Sitter spacetime is obtained by joining together Carter’s blocks, i.e. suitable four dimensional spacetime regions contained within Killing horizons or within a Killing horizon and an asymptotic de Sitter region. Based on this property, and leaving aside topological identifications, we show that the causal properties of a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime are determined by the causal properties of the individual Carter’s blocks viewed as spacetimes in their own right. We show that any Carter’s block is stably causal except for the blocks that contain the ring singularity. The latter are vicious sets, i.e. any two events within such block can be connected by a future (respectively past) directed timelike curve. This behavior is identical to the causal behavior of the Boyer–Lindquist blocks that contain the Kerr ring singularity. These blocks are also vicious as demonstrated long ago by Carter. On the other hand, while for the case of a naked Kerr singularity the entire spacetime is vicious and thus closed timelike curves pass through any event including events in the asymptotic region, for the case of a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime the cosmological horizons protect the asymptotic de Sitter region from a-causal influences. In that regard, a positive cosmological constant appears to improve the causal behavior of the underlying spacetime.

We present a method that allows to calculate the redshift of a compact binary star which moves in a strong external gravitational field, e.g. the field of a supermassive black hole. If the binary is close enough to the field center, its motion can be relativistic, while the relative motion of the stars in the binary is still non-relativistic. The latter can be computed in a co-moving reference frame. We calculate the redshift in a co-moving frame in Fermi coordinates as a series in the size of the binary <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\varrho \)</span>. The obtained expression is written in a covariant form up to linear terms in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\varrho \)</span>. Using the equations of motion that have been obtained in a previous paper, we present the method of calculation of the redshift of a sample binary star moving in the field of a black hole. We illustrate this method by numerical model for the case of spherically-symmetric (Schwarzschild) black hole. The method can be applied to the analysis of the timing data of pulsars in the vicinity of the Galactic Center, and to the reconstruction of the binary star motion by its redshift.
We present the results of an investigation of the speed of a radially infalling test particle crossing the event horizon of a black hole within a Schwarzschild spacetime. One finds that the speed as measured by a special class of observers, at rest outside the horizon and static inside the horizon, increases when the test particle approaches the horizon but decreases inside the horizon. The corresponding situation regarding black holes possessing both outer and inner horizons is also briefly discussed.
In recent past, Hawking temperature has been modified for the validity of thermodynamical laws at the event horizon in general relativity context. This lead to the introduction of modified Hawking temperature and it has been found that the modified Hawking temperature is more realistic on the event horizon. With this motivation, here we investigate the thermodynamical consistency of scalar-tensor gravity based models by examining the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamical equilibrium (TE) at the event horizon. In order to attain our goal, we consider a spatially flat Friedman–Robertson–Walker Universe filled with ordinary matter and the boundary of the Universe bounded by the event horizon that is in thermal equilibrium with modified Hawking temperature. Next, we calculate the general expressions for the GSLT and TE using modified Hawking temperature in the context of the more general action of scalar-tensor gravity where there is a non-minimally coupling between the scalar field and matter Lagrangian (as the chameleon field). From the general expression of GSLT, we find that the null energy condition must hold for a viable scalar-tensor model of the Universe dominated by a perfect fluid. Furthermore, in order to better understand these complicated general expressions of GSLT and TE, we explore the validity of the GSLT and TE for two viable models of scalar-tensor gravity namely Brans–Dicke gravity with a self-interacting potential and Chameleon gravity at the event horizon using special cosmological solutions. Finally, some graphical representation of the GSLT and TE have been presented. From the graphical analysis, we found that the power-law forms of the scale factor and scalar field is much favourable for the study of universal thermodynamics as compared to other choices of the scalar field and the analytic function.

In this paper, we consider a charged rotating AdS black holes in four dimensions and study the effects of leading-order thermal corrections on the thermodynamics of such system explicitly. The first-order corrected thermodynamical quantities also satisfy the first-law of thermodynamics of the black holes. The holographic duality between the charged rotating AdS black holes and Van der Waals fluid is also emphasized through the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(P-v\)</span> diagram. Finally, we study the effects of the leading-order thermal corrections on the stability of the charged rotating black holes.
The intricated combinatorial structure and the non-compactness of the Lorentz group have always made the computation of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(SL(2,\mathbb {C})\)</span> EPRL spin foam transition amplitudes a very hard and resource demanding task. With <span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">sl2cfoam</span> we provide a C-coded library for the evaluation of the Lorentzian EPRL vertex amplitude. We provide a tool to compute the Lorentzian EPRL 4-simplex vertex amplitude in the intertwiner basis and some utilities to evaluate SU(2) invariants, booster functions and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(SL(2,\mathbb {C})\)</span> Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. We discuss the data storage, parallelizations, time, and memory performances and possible future developments.
Using a perturbative method, we investigate solutions of the Dirac equations for a charged massive spinor field in the background of a magnetar, both in the interior solution and outside the star. A special attention is given to cases where the variables can be separated and the wave function is expressed in terms of the Heun’s general or confluent functions.
Chargeless massive scalar fields are studied in the spacetime of Born–Infeld dilaton black holes (BIDBHs). We first separate the massive covariant Klein–Gordon equation into radial and angular parts and obtain the exact solution of the radial equation in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Using the obtained radial solution, we show how one gets the exact quasinormal modes for some particular cases. We also solve the Klein–Gordon equation solution in the spacetime of a BIDBHs with a cosmic string in which we point out the effect of the conical deficit on the BIDBHs. The analytical solutions of the radial and angular parts are obtained in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Finally, we study the quantization of the BIDBH. While doing this, we also discuss the Hawking radiation in terms of the effective temperature.
In this paper, we systematically study spacetimes of gravitational plane waves in Einstein-aether theory. Due to the presence of the timelike aether vector field, now the problem in general becomes overdetermined. In particular, for the linearly polarized plane waves, there are five independent vacuum Einstein-aether field equations for three unknown functions. Therefore, solutions exist only for particular choices of the four free parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(c_{i}\)</span>’s of the theory. We find that there exist eight cases, in two of which any form of gravitational plane waves can exist, similar to that in general relativity, while in the other six cases, gravitational plane waves exist only in particular forms. Beyond these eight cases, solutions either do not exist or are trivial (simply representing a Minkowski spacetime with a constant or dynamical aether field).
We consider the metric of a generic axially symmetric rotating stationary black hole. The general approach is developed that enables us to construct coordinate frame regular near the horizon. As explicit examples, the Kerr and Kerr–Newmann-(anti-)de Sitter metrics are considered. It is shown how the rotational versions of the Painlevé–Gullstrand and Doran coordinates appear in this scheme as particular cases. For the 2 + 1 version of the metric the direct generalization of the Lemaître coordinate system is obtained. It is shown that the possibility of introducing a regular frame is indirectly related to the constancy of a black hole angular velocity and the rate with which the metric coefficient responsible for the rotation of spacetime tends to it.
In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the spatially inhomogeneous relativistic Boltzmann equation with near vacuum initial data. The collision kernel considered here is for the hard potentials case and the background space-time in which the study is done is the Robertson–Walker space-time. Unique global (with respect to the direction of time corresponding to the expansion of the universe) classical solution is obtained. This is done in a suitable weighted space.
Hawking’s singularity theorem concerns matter obeying the strong energy condition (SEC), which means that all observers experience a nonnegative effective energy density (EED), thereby guaranteeing the timelike convergence property. However, there are models that do not satisfy the SEC and therefore lie outside the scope of Hawking’s hypotheses, an important example being the massive Klein–Gordon field. Here we derive lower bounds on local averages of the EED for solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation, allowing nonzero mass and nonminimal coupling to the scalar curvature. The averages are taken along timelike geodesics or over spacetime volumes, and our bounds are valid for a range of coupling constants including both minimal and conformal coupling. Using methods developed by Fewster and Galloway, these lower bounds are applied to prove a Hawking-type singularity theorem for solutions to the Einstein–Klein–Gordon theory, asserting that solutions with sufficient initial contraction at a compact Cauchy surface will be future timelike geodesically incomplete. These results remain true in the presence of additional matter obeying both the strong and weak energy conditions.
Motivated by the recent increased interest in energy non-conserving models in cosmology, we extend the analysis of the cosmological consequences of the Classical Channel Model of Gravity (CCG). This model is based on the classical–quantum interaction between a test particle and a metric (classical) and results in a theory with a modified Wheeler–deWitt equation that in turn leads to non conservation of energy. We show that CCG applied to a cosmological scenario with primordial matter leads to an emergent dark fluid that at late times behaves as a curvature term in the Friedmann equations, showing that the late time behaviour is always dominated by the vacuum solution. We discuss possible observational constraints for this model and that—in its current formulation—CCG eludes any meaningful constraints from current observations.
We study <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D</em>-dimensional Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravitational model including the Gauss–Bonnet term and the cosmological term <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Lambda \)</span>. We find a class of solutions with exponential time dependence of two scale factors, governed by two Hubble-like parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(H &gt;0\)</span> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>, corresponding to factor spaces of dimensions <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(m &gt;2\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(l &gt; 2\)</span>, respectively. These solutions contain a fine-tuned <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Lambda = \Lambda (x, m, l, \alpha )\)</span>, which depends upon the ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(h/H = x\)</span>, dimensions of factor spaces <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>, and the ratio <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\alpha = \alpha _2/\alpha _1\)</span> of two constants (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\alpha _2\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\alpha _1\)</span>) of the model. The master equation <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq12">\(\Lambda (x, m, l,\alpha ) = \Lambda \)</span> is equivalent to a polynomial equation of either fourth or third order and may be solved in radicals. The explicit solution for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq13">\(m = l\)</span> is presented in “Appendix”. Imposing certain restrictions on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, we prove the stability of the solutions in a class of cosmological solutions with diagonal metrics. We also consider a subclass of solutions with small enough variation of the effective gravitational constant <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">G</em> and show the stability of all solutions from this subclass.
In this paper analytical solutions of the Mathisson–Papapetrou equations that describe nonequatorial circular orbits of a spinning particle in the Schwarzschild–de Sitter background are studied, and the role of the cosmological constant is emphasized. It is shown that generally speaking a highly relativistic velocity of the particle is a necessary condition of motion along this type of orbits, with an exception of orbits locating close to the position of the static equilibrium, where low velocities are possible as well. Depending on the correlation between the spin orientation of the particle and its orbital velocity some of the possible nonequatorial circular orbits exist due to the repulsive action on the particle caused by the spin–gravity coupling and the others are caused by the attractive action. Here values of the energy of the particle on the corresponding orbits are also analyzed.
In this paper, we analytically investigate the noncommutative effects of a charged black hole on holographic superconductors in the probe limit. The effects of charge of the black hole is investigated in our study. Employing the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue method, the relation between the critical temperature and charge density is analytically investigated. The condensation operator is then computed. It is observed that condensate gets harder to form for large values of charge of the black hole.
The present work includes an analytical investigation of a collapsing spherical star in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. The interior of the collapsing star admits a conformal flatness. Information regarding the fate of the collapse is extracted from the matching conditions of the extrinsic curvature and the Ricci curvature scalar across the boundary hypersurface of the star. The radial distribution of the physical quantities such as density, anisotropic pressure and radial heat flux are studied. The inhomogeneity of the collapsing interior leads to a non-zero acceleration. The divergence of this acceleration and the loss of energy through a heat conduction forces the rate of the collapse to die down and the formation of a zero proper volume singularity is realized only asymptotically.
The Sagnac effect can be described as the difference in travel time between two photons traveling along the same path in opposite directions. In this paper we explore the consequences of this characterisation in the context of General Relativity. We derive a general expression for this time difference in an arbitrary space-time for arbitrary paths. In general, this formula is not very useful since it involves solving a differential equation along the path. However, we also present special cases where a closed form expression for the time difference can be given. The main part of the paper deals with the discussion of the effect in a small neighbourhood of an arbitrarily moving observer in their arbitrarily rotating reference frame. We also discuss the special case of stationary space-times and point out the relationship between the Sagnac effect and Fizeau’s “aether-drag” experiment.
By applying a recent method—based on a tetrad formalism in General Relativity and the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor—to the simple spherical static case, we found that the only static solution with homogeneous energy density is the Schwarzschild solution and that there are no spherically symmetric dynamic solutions consistent with the homogeneous energy density assumption. Finally, a circular equivalence is shown among the most frequent conditions considered in the spherical symmetric case: homogeneous density, isotropy in pressures, conformally flatness and shear-free conditions. We demonstrate that, due to the regularity conditions at the center of the matter distribution, the imposition of two conditions necessarily leads to the static case.
This is an English translation of A. Lichnerowicz’ 1964 paper “Propagateurs, commutateurs et anticommutateurs en relativité générale”. It was based on lectures at a Les Houches school, and gave a classic summary of the author’s work on quantum propagators in curved space-times, introducing tensorial and spinorial propagators which generalise the flat space propagators of Jordan and Pauli. It gives the quantum commutators for the Maxwell and Dirac fields and for perturbations of the gravitational field, and numerous intermediate formulae. The results are basic to quantum field theory in curved space-times. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by G. Esposito and by a brief biography written by M. A. H. MacCallum.

We study the phase transition of rainbow inspired higher dimensional Schwarzschild black hole incorporating the effects of the generalized uncertainty principle. First, we obtain the relation between the mass and Hawking temperature of the rainbow inspired black hole taking into account the effects of the modified dispersion relation and the generalized uncertainty principle. The heat capacity is then computed from this relation which reveals that there are remnants. The entropy of the black hole is next obtained in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(3+1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(4+1\)</span>-dimensions and is found to have logarithmic corrections only in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(3+1\)</span>-dimensions. We further investigate the local temperature, free energy and stability of the black hole in an isothermal cavity. From the analysis of the free energy, we find that there are two Hawking–Page type phase transitions in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(3+1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(4+1\)</span>-dimensions if we take into account the generalized uncertainty principle. However, in the absence of the generalized uncertainty principle, only one Hawking–Page type phase transition exists in spacetime dimensions greater than four.
For a given space-time and for an arbitrary time-like geodesic, we analyze the conditions for the construction of Fermi coordinates so that they are also rigid covariant. We then apply these conditions to linear plane gravitational waves.
Half of the Bondi–Metzner–Sachs (BMS) transformations consist of orientation-preserving conformal homeomorphisms of the extended complex plane known as fractional linear (or Möbius) transformations. These can be of 4 kinds, i.e. they are classified as being parabolic, or hyperbolic, or elliptic, or loxodromic, depending on the number of fixed points and on the value of the trace of the associated <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix in the projective version of the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(SL(2,\mathbb {C})\)</span> group. The resulting particular forms of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(SL(2,\mathbb {C})\)</span> matrices affect also the other half of BMS transformations, and are used here to propose 4 realizations of the asymptotic symmetry group that we call, again, parabolic, or hyperbolic, or elliptic, or loxodromic. In the second part of the paper, we prove that a subset of hyperbolic and loxodromic transformations, those having trace that approaches <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\infty \)</span>, correspond to the fulfillment of limit-point condition for singular Sturm–Liouville problems. Thus, a profound link may exist between the language for describing asymptotically flat space-times and the world of complex analysis and self-adjoint problems in ordinary quantum mechanics.
There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the structure of the gravitational field at null infinity, sparked by new results on soft charges and infrared issues related to the S matrix theory in perturbative quantum gravity. We summarize these developments and put them in the broader context of research in the relativity community that dates back to several decades. In keeping with intent of this series, this overview is addressed to gravitational scientists who are not experts in this specific area.

This paper appeared in Russian in Doklady AN SSSR and in English in the translation journal Soviet Physics–Doklady. In it the cosmic radiation from galaxies in the frequency range <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(10^8 \hbox {Hz}\)</span> to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(10^{15} \hbox {Hz}\)</span> was estimated and shown to agree with data. It was then shown, following earlier ideas of Gamow, that the black-body cosmic microwave background from a big bang would significantly exceed the galactic radiation in the range <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(10^9 \hbox {Hz}\)</span> to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(10^{11} \hbox {Hz}\)</span>. This was the first accurate prediction of that background, which now plays a key role in cosmology. The first announcement of its detection came in the following year. The paper has been selected by the Editors of General Relativity and Gravitation for re-publication in the Golden Oldies series of the journal. This republication is accompanied by an editorial note written by R. Durrer and a brief autobiography by A. G. Doroshkevich: an autobiography of I. D. Novikov appeared with a previous Golden Oldie.
In a recent paper Cañate (Class Quantum Grav 35:025018, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR33">2018</a></span>) proved a no hair theorem to static and spherically symmetric or stationary axisymmetric black holes in general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) gravity. The theorem applies for isolated asymptotically flat or asymptotically de Sitter black holes and also in the case when vacuum is replaced by a minimally coupled source having a traceless energy momentum tensor. This theorem excludes the case of pure quadratic gravity, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(f(R) = R^2\)</span>. In this paper we use the scalar tensor representation of general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">f</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">R</em>) theory to show that there are no hairy black hole in pure <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(R^2\)</span> gravity. The result is limited to spherically symmetric black holes but does not assume asymptotic flatness or de-Sitter asymptotics as in most of the no-hair theorems encountered in the literature. We include an example of a static and spherically symmetric black hole in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(R^2\)</span> gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field having a Higgs-type quartic potential.
We study the conformal structure of exotic (non-big-bang) singularity universes using the hybrid big-bang/exotic singularity/big-bang and big-rip/exotic singularity/big-rip models by investigating their appropriate Penrose diagrams. We show that the diagrams have the standard structure for the big-bang and big-rip and that exotic singularities appear just as the constant time hypersurfaces for the time of a singularity and because of their geodesic completeness are potentially transversable. We also comment on some applications and extensions of the Penrose diagram method in studying exotic singularities.
We investigate geodesic orbits and manifolds for metrics associated with Schwarzschild geometry, considering space and time curvatures separately. For ‘a-temporal’ space, we solve a central geodesic orbit equation in terms of elliptic integrals. The intrinsic geometry of a two-sided equatorial plane corresponds to that of a full Flamm’s paraboloid. Two kinds of geodesics emerge. Both kinds may or may not encircle the hole region any number of times, crossing themselves correspondingly. Regular geodesics reach a periastron greater than the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(r_S\)</span> Schwarzschild radius, thus remaining confined to a half of Flamm’s paraboloid. Singular or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em>-geodesics tangentially reach the <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(r_S\)</span> circle. These <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">s</em>-geodesics must then be regarded as funneling through the ‘belt’ of the full Flamm’s paraboloid. Infinitely many geodesics can possibly be drawn between any two points, but they must be of specific regular or singular types. A precise classification can be made in terms of impact parameters. Geodesic structure and completeness is conveyed by computer-generated figures depicting either Schwarzschild equatorial plane or Flamm’s paraboloid. For the ‘curved-time’ metric, devoid of any spatial curvature, geodesic orbits have the same apsides as in Schwarzschild space-time. We focus on null geodesics in particular. For the limit of light grazing the sun, asymptotic ‘spatial bending’ and ‘time bending’ become essentially equal, adding up to the total light deflection of 1.75 arc-seconds predicted by general relativity. However, for a much closer approach of the periastron to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(r_S\)</span>, ‘time bending’ largely exceeds ‘spatial bending’ of light, while their sum remains substantially below that of Schwarzschild space-time.
The specification of energy for gravitating systems has been an unsettled issue since Einstein proposed his pseudotensor. It is now understood that energy-momentum is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quasi-local</em> (associated with a closed 2-surface). Here we consider quasi-local proposals (including pseudotensors) in the Lagrangian–Noether–Hamiltonian formulations. There are two ambiguities: (1) there are many possible expressions, (2) they depend on some non-dynamical structure, e.g., a reference frame. The Hamiltonian approach gives a handle on both problems. The Hamiltonian perspective helped us to make a remarkable discovery: with an isometric Minkowski reference a large class of expressions—namely all those that agree with the Einstein pseudotensor’s Freud superpotential to linear order—give a common quasi-local energy value. Moreover, with a best-matched reference on the boundary this is the Wang–Yau mass value.
Noether symmetry in the modified theory of gravity with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(F({\mathcal {R}})\)</span>-term in the action in the background of 5-dimensional Kaluza–Klein cosmology yields <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(F({{\mathcal {R}}})\propto {\mathcal {R}}^n\)</span> for arbitrary <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>. Wormhole is allowed quantum mechanically with both <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(n=\frac{3}{2}\)</span> and 2. Further wormhole is allowed from the Euclidean field equations for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(n=\frac{3}{2}\)</span> only, however for <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(n=2\)</span> its existence is not clear. Quantum wormholes are also allowed for arbitrary <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> with <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(n&gt; \frac{1}{2}\)</span> except <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(n=1\)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\frac{13}{10}\)</span> from the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in terms of new canonical variables obtained from Noether symmetry, consistent with solution in terms of old variables. We present concept of time in quantum cosmology with use of Noether constant of motion. We also present an idea of transition from wormhole configuration to the inflationary era.
The use of quantum field theory to understand astrophysical phenomena is not new. However, for the most part, the methods used are those that have been developed decades ago. The intervening years have seen some remarkable developments in computational quantum field theoretic tools. In particle physics, this technology has facilitated calculations that, even ten years ago would have seemed laughably difficult. It is remarkable, then, that most of these new techniques have remained firmly within the domain of high energy physics. We would like to change this. As alluded to in the title, this paper is aimed at showcasing the use of modern on-shell methods in the context of astrophysics and cosmology. In this article, we use the old problem of the bending of light by a compact object as an anchor to pedagogically develop these new computational tools. Once developed, we then illustrate their power and utility with an application to the scattering of gravitational waves.
The Garfinkle–Vachaspati transform is a deformation of a metric in terms of a null, hypersurface orthogonal, Killing vector <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(k^\mu \)</span>. We explore a generalisation of this deformation in type IIB supergravity taking motivation from certain studies of the D1–D5 system. We consider solutions of minimal six-dimensional supergravity admitting null Killing vector <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(k^\mu \)</span> trivially lifted to type IIB supergravity by the addition of four-torus directions. The torus directions provide covariantly constant spacelike vectors <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(l^\mu \)</span>. We show that the original solution can be deformed as <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\( g_{\mu \nu } \rightarrow g_{\mu \nu } + 2 \, \Phi k_{(\mu }l_{\nu )}, \ C_{\mu \nu } \rightarrow C_{\mu \nu } - 2 \, \Phi k_{[\mu }l_{\nu ]}, \)</span> provided the two-form supporting the original spacetime satisfies <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(i_k (dC) = - d k\)</span>, and where <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Phi \)</span> satisfies the equation of a minimal massless scalar field on the original spacetime. We show that the condition <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(i_k (dC) = - d k\)</span> is satisfied by all supersymmetric solutions admitting null Killing vector. Hence all supersymmetric solutions of minimal six-dimensional supergravity can be deformed via this method. As an example of our approach, we work out the deformation on a class of D1–D5–P geometries with orbifolds. We show that the deformed spacetimes are smooth and identify their CFT description. Using Bena–Warner formalism, we also express the deformed solutions in other duality frames.

The notion of L-boundary, a new causal boundary proposed by R. Low based on constructing a ‘sky at infinity’ for any light ray, is discussed in detail. The analysis of the notion of L-boundary will be done in the 3-dimensional situation for the ease of presentation. The proposed notion of causal boundary is intrinsically conformal and, as it will be proved in the paper, under natural conditions provides a natural extension <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\({\overline{M}}\)</span> of the given spacetime <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> with smooth boundary <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\partial M = {\overline{M}} {\backslash } M\)</span>. The extensions <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\({\overline{M}}\)</span> of any conformal manifold <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> constructed in this way are characterised exclusively in terms of local properties at the boundary points. Such extensions are called L-extensions and it is proved that, if they exist, they are essentially unique. Finally it is shown that in the 3-dimensional case, any L-extension is equivalent to the canonical extension obtained by using the L-boundary of the manifold.
In this study, the quantum gravity effect on the tunnelling radiation of charged massive spin-0 scalar particle from <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(2+1\)</span> dimensional charged rotating Banados–Teitelboim–Zanelli (BTZ) black hole is looked into by using the Hamilton–Jacobi approach. For this, we calculate the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole by using the modified Klein–Gordon equation based on the generalized uncertainty principle, and we noticed that the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole depends not only on the black hole properties, but also on the angular momentum, energy, charge and mass of the tunnelling scalar particle. Using the modified Hawking temperature, we discussed the stability of the black hole in the context of the modified heat capacity, and observed that it might undergo both first and 1 phase transitions in the presence of the quantum gravity effect, but just a first-type transition in the absence of the quantum gravity effect. Furthermore, we investigated the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole by using the tunnelling processes of the charged massive Dirac and vector boson particles. We observed that scalar, Dirac and vector particles are tunnelled from the black hole completely differently from each other in the presence of the quantum gravity effect.
Dark energy is modelled by a Bose–Einstein gas of particles with an attractive interaction. It is coupled to cold dark matter, within a flat universe, for the late-expansion description, producing variations in particle-number densities. The model’s parameters, and physical association, are: <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\Omega _{G0}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\Omega _{m0}\)</span>, the dark-energy rest-mass energy density and the dark-matter term scaling as a mass term, respectively; <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\Omega _{i0}\)</span>, the self-interaction intensity; <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em>, the energy exchange rate. Energy conservation relates such parameters. The Hubble equation omits <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\Omega _{G0}\)</span>, but also contains <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>, the present-day expansion rate of the flat Friedman–Lemâitre–Robertson–Walker metric, and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\Omega _{b0}\)</span>, the baryon energy density, used as a prior. This results in the four effective chosen parameters <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\Omega _{b0}\)</span>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">h</em>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\Omega _{m0}\)</span>, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\Omega _{i0}\)</span>, fit with the Hubble expansion rate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">H</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">z</em>), and data from its value today, near distance, and supernovas. We derive wide <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(1\sigma \)</span> and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(2\sigma \)</span> likelihood regions compatible with definite positive total CDM and IBEG mass terms. Additionally, the best-fit value of parameter <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> relieves the coincidence problem, and a second potential coincidence problem related to the choice of <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\Omega _{G0}\)</span>.
