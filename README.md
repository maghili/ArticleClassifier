# ArticleClassifier
This work is designed to classify articles based on their abstracts, and recommend the journals that are more likely to publish the work and possibly the time line for papers estimated publication.

The data for this project is collected by myself using regular expressions (reg-ex) and Bash scripting which I will not share here because this is an ongoing project. The data for each journal is saved in a separate text file. I have presented part of the data in this repository. The data from **European Physical Journal C** (`content.txt`) and **General Relativity and Gravitation** journal (`grg_abstracts.txt`) are used here.

In this repository I keep the Jupyter notebook that I used to apply classification algorithms and process the text. The rest of the work will be uploaded upon completion. 

This code only includes the abstract text of the articles from two journals and will therefore have 2 classes. (It will be generalized soon ...)
