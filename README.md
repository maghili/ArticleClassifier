# ArticleClassifier
In this work, I want to present a NaiveBayesClassifier model form NLTK package in python that I used for classification of scientific articles based on their abstract content.
The data for this project is collected by myself form the journals website using regular expressions (reg-ex) and some bash scripting. The purpose is to use the abstract text and recommend the journal that is most likely to publish the paper.
In this repository I keep the Jupyter notebook that I used to apply this classification algorithm and the rest will be uploaded upon comletion. 
This code only included the abstract text of the articles from two journals and will therefore have 2 classes. (It will be generalized soon ...)
